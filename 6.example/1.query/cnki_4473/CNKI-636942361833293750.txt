          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex and heterogeneous disease, and there is a clinical need for validated markers and biomarkers that can contribute to the assessment of patients, risk prediction, treatment guidance, and assessment of response. Although according to the 2018 GOLD guidelines clinically useful biomarkers for COPD patients in stable condition have yet to be identified, several clinical markers and biomarkers have been proposed for COPD. These include isolated clinical markers, such as symptoms and Health Status assessment, exercise tests, function tests and imaging, and also composite scores and molecular markers.(#br)However, and despite strong efforts to identify useful markers in an attempt to improve prognostic and therapeutic approaches, results have not been consistent and expectations of relying on these markers in near future are faint.(#br)Current approaches to COPD have shifted from treating the disease to treating the individual patient. There is a clear need to identify treatable traits, focusing more on the patient and not on the disease, in order to implement an increasingly personalized treatment of COPD in the clinic, leading to true precision medicine. There is a need to identify combinations of clinical markers and biomarkers, genetic markers, and phenotypes that can guide the personalized therapy of COPD patients.(#br)This critical review will therefore focus not only on currently established markers and biomarkers in COPD but also on possible future approaches toward precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Evidence-based medicine is the most prevalent paradigm adopted by physicians. Clinical practice guidelines typically define a set of recommendations together with eligibility criteria that restrict their applicability to a specific group of patients. The ever-growing size and availability of health-related data is currently challenging the broad definitions of guideline-defined patient groups. Precision medicine leverages on genetic, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics to provide precise identification of patient subsets for treatment targeting. Defining a patient similarity measure is thus an essential step to allow stratification of patients into clinically-meaningful subgroups. The present review investigates the use of patient similarity as a tool to enable precision medicine. 279 articles were analyzed along four dimensions: data types considered, clinical domains of application, data analysis methods, and translational stage of findings. Cancer-related research employing molecular profiling and standard data analysis techniques such as clustering constitute the majority of the retrieved studies. Chronic and psychiatric diseases follow as the second most represented clinical domains. Interestingly, almost one quarter of the studies analyzed presented a novel methodology, with the most advanced employing data integration strategies and being portable to different clinical domains. Integration of such techniques into decision support systems constitutes and interesting trend for future research.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Modern medicine is in the midst of a revolution driven by “big data,” rapidly advancing computing power, and broader integration of technology into healthcare. Highly detailed and individualized profiles of both health and disease states are now possible, including biomarkers, genomic profiles, cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, high-frequency assessments, and medical imaging. Although these data are incredibly complex, they can potentially be used to understand multi-determinant causal relationships, elucidate modifiable factors, and ultimately customize treatments based on individual parameters. Especially for neurodegenerative diseases, where an effective therapeutic agent has yet to be discovered, there remains a critical need for an interdisciplinary perspective on data and information management due to the number of unanswered questions. Biomedical informatics is a multidisciplinary field that falls at the intersection of information technology, computer and data science, engineering, and healthcare that will be instrumental for uncovering novel insights into neurodegenerative disease research, including both causal relationships and therapeutic targets and maximizing the utility of both clinical and research data. The present study aims to provide a brief overview of biomedical informatics and how clinical data applications such as clinical decision support tools can be developed to derive new knowledge from the wealth of available data to advance clinical care and scientific research of neurodegenerative diseases in the era of precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are characterised by considerable phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. Treating HCC and designing clinical trials are particularly challenging because co-existing liver disease, present in most patients, limits aggressive therapeutic options. Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities. However, failure of several large randomised controlled clinical trials over the last 10 years underlines the necessity for innovative treatment strategies and implementation of translational findings to overcome the unmet clinical need. Furthermore, the promising results from novel immunotherapies are likely to complement the landscape of active compounds for HCC and will require a completely different approach to patients, as well as the development of prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Given our increasing understanding of the most abundant molecular alterations in HCC, effective enrichment of patients based on clinical and molecular biomarkers, as well as adaptive clinical trials, are now feasible and should be implemented. Herein, we aim to review important aspects of precision medicine approaches in HCC that might contribute to improving the molecular subclassification of patients in a clinical trial setting and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are among the leading causes of disability and mortality. Considerable sex differences exist in the occurrence of the various manifestations leading to cognitive decline. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibits substantial sexual dimorphisms and disproportionately affects women. Women have a higher life expectancy compared to men and, consequently, have more lifespan to develop AD. The emerging precision medicine and pharmacology concepts – taking into account the individual genetic and biological variability relevant for disease risk, prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment – are expected to substantially enhance our knowledge and management of AD. Stratifying the affected individuals by sex and gender is an important basic step towards personalization of scientific research, drug development, and care.(#br)We hypothesize that sex and gender differences, extending from genetic to psychosocial domains, are highly relevant for the understanding of AD pathophysiology, and for the conceptualization of basic/translational research and for clinical therapy trial design.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Clinical research and practice in the 21st century is poised to be transformed by analysis of computable electronic medical records and population-level genome-scale patient profiles. Genomic data capture genetic and environmental state, providing information on heterogeneity in disease and treatment outcome, but genomic-based clinical risk scores are limited. Achieving the goal of routine precision medicine that takes advantage of these rich genomics data will require computational methods that support heterogeneous data, have excellent predictive performance, and ideally, provide biologically interpretable results. Traditional machine-learning approaches excel at performance, but often have limited interpretability. Patient similarity networks are an emerging paradigm for precision medicine, in which patients are clustered or classified based on their similarities in various features, including genomic profiles. This strategy is analogous to standard medical diagnosis, has excellent performance, is interpretable, and can preserve patient privacy. We review new methods based on patient similarity networks, including Similarity Network Fusion for patient clustering and netDx for patient classification. While these methods are already useful, much work is required to improve their scalability for contemporary genetic cohorts, optimize parameters, and incorporate a wide range of genomics and clinical data. The coming 5 years will provide an opportunity to assess the utility of network-based algorithms for precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This address was delivered by Harold I. Feldman, MD, MSCE, at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Epidemiology in New Orleans, Louisiana, on September 26, 2017. Dr. Feldman is George S. Pepper Professor of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine, and Chair, Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He is recognized nationally and internationally for his expertise in kidney disease epidemiology. Dr. Feldman pioneered the integration of epidemiology and renal medicine with his first studies of dialyzer reuse and hemodialysis vascular access morbidity. He is internationally renowned in nephrology and clinical epidemiology and an architect of one of the largest and most successful epidemiological research programs in chronic kidney disease. For over 15 years, he has led NIH's Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study, placing him at the helm of the “Framingham Study of Renal Disease”. It has elucidated the chronic kidney disease–specific relationships of mineral dysmetabolism and cardiovascular complications; dietary sodium and heart failure; novel vascular stiffness metrics and renal disease progression; cardiovascular biomarkers and heart failure; and cognitive decline and renal dysfunction, among others. He has also led the nation's largest trials targeting hemodialysis vascular access morbidity, discovered the benefits of transplantation before dialysis dependence, elucidated racial disparities and the role of genetics in kidney failure, and shaped our understanding of the toxicity from unregulated reuse of medical devices. He is the past President of the American College of Epidemiology and directs one of the nation's largest clinical epidemiology and biostatistics programs. Dr. Feldman has an MD from Boston University and an MSCE from the University of Pennsylvania. He is an elected member of the American Society of Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians, and the American Epidemiological Society.]]>

          <![CDATA[There is a great deal of hype surrounding the concept of personalized medicine. Personalized medicine is rooted in the belief that since individuals possess nuanced and unique characteristics at the molecular, physiological, environmental exposure, and behavioral levels, they may need to have interventions provided to them for diseases they possess that are tailored to these nuanced and unique characteristics. This belief has been verified to some degree through the application of emerging technologies such as DNA sequencing, proteomics, imaging protocols, and wireless health monitoring devices, which have revealed great inter-individual variation in disease processes. In this review, we consider the motivation for personalized medicine, its historical precedents, the emerging technologies that are enabling it, some recent experiences including successes and setbacks, ways of vetting and deploying personalized medicines, and future directions, including potential ways of treating individuals with fertility and sterility issues. We also consider current limitations of personalized medicine. We ultimately argue that since aspects of personalized medicine are rooted in biological realities, personalized medicine practices in certain contexts are likely to be inevitable, especially as relevant assays and deployment strategies become more efficient and cost-effective.]]>

          <![CDATA[Although most medical treatments are designed for the average patient with a one-size-fits-all-approach, they may not benefit all. Better understanding of the function of genes, proteins, and metabolite, and of personal and environmental factors has led to a call for personalized medicine. Personalized reproductive medicine is still in its infancy, without clear guidance on treatment aspects that could be personalized and on trial design to evaluate personalized treatment effect and benefit–harm balance. While the rationale for a personalized approach often relies on retrospective analyses of large observational studies or real-world data, solid evidence of superiority of a personalized approach will come from randomized trials comparing outcomes and safety between a personalized and one-size-fits-all strategy. A more efficient, targeted randomized trial design may recruit only patients or couples for which the personalized approach would differ from the previous, standard approach. Multiple monocenter studies using the same study protocol (allowing future meta-analysis) might reduce the major center effect associated with multicenter studies. In certain cases, single-arm observational studies can generate the necessary evidence for a personalized approach. This review describes each of the main segments of patient care in assisted reproductive technologies treatment, addressing which aspects could be personalized, emphasizing current evidence and relevant study design.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Squamous cell carcinomas are the most frequent subgroup among head and neck malignant tumors (HNSCC). Tobacco (±<ce:hsp sp=0.25/>alcohol) and HPV infection, the two main risk factors, define two entities with distinct anatomo-clinical and genetic features. HPV-positive, non-tobacco-related HNSCCs are associated with a better prognosis, a rather simple genomic profile, frequent activating mutations of genes involved in pi3kinase-pathway, and the scarcity of mutations of tumor suppressor genes. HPV-negative, tobacco-related HNSCC are genetically more complex, are characterized by almost mandatory inactivating mutations/deletions of tumor suppressor genes ( TP53 , CDKN2A ) and the possible, but less frequent, activating mutations or amplifications of some oncogenes that encode for cell cycle proteins or receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. This review describes the genetic features of HNSCC and discusses how these abnormalities could be incorporated into a therapeutic approach.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to influence nearly every aspect of the human condition, and cardiology is not an exception to this trend. This paper provides a guide for clinicians on relevant aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, reviews selected applications of these methods in cardiology to date, and identifies how cardiovascular medicine could incorporate artificial intelligence in the future. In particular, the paper first reviews predictive modeling concepts relevant to cardiology such as feature selection and frequent pitfalls such as improper dichotomization. Second, it discusses common algorithms used in supervised learning and reviews selected applications in cardiology and related disciplines. Third, it describes the advent of deep learning and related methods collectively called unsupervised learning, provides contextual examples both in general medicine and in cardiovascular medicine, and then explains how these methods could be applied to enable precision cardiology and improve patient outcomes.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) often progresses to poor health outcomes in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). This, combined with the relatively insensitive clinical tools used for its diagnosis (spirometry, histopathology) led us to determine whether clinical AMR is diagnosed significantly later than its pathologic onset. In this study, we leveraged the high sensitivity of donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA), a novel genomic tool, to detect early graft injury after lung transplantation.(#br)Methods(#br)We adjudicated AMR and acute cellular rejection (ACR) in 157 LTRs using the consensus criteria of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). We assessed the kinetics of allograft injury in relation to ACR or AMR using both clinical criteria (decline in spirometry from baseline) and molecular criteria (ddcfDNA); percent ddcfDNA was quantitated via shotgun sequencing. We used a mixed-linear model to assess the relationship between and ddcfDNA levels and donor-specific antibodies (DSA) in AMR + LTRs.(#br)Results(#br)Compared with ACR, AMR episodes ( n = 42) were associated with significantly greater allograft injury when assessed by both spirometric (0.1 liter vs −0.6 liter, p < 0.01) and molecular (ddcfDNA) analysis (1.1% vs 5.4%, p < 0.001). Allograft injury detected by ddcfDNA preceded clinical AMR diagnosis by a median of 2.8 months. Within the same interval, spirometry or histopathology did not reveal findings of allograft injury or dysfunction. Elevated levels of ddcfDNA before clinical diagnosis of AMR were associated with a concurrent rise in DSA levels.(#br)Conclusion(#br)Diagnosis of clinical AMR in LTRs lags behind DSA-associated molecular allograft injury as assessed by ddcfDNA.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Different fields of cancer management consider bone health to be of increasing clinical importance for patients: 1) presence of bone metastases in many solid tumors, 2) use of bone-targeted treatments in the reduction of bone metastasis, 3) effects of cancer treatment on reproductive hormones, critical for normal bone remodeling maintenance. Additionally, bone microenvironment is further complicated by the decline of ovarian sex steroid production and by the related increase in inflammatory factors linked to menopause, which result in accelerated bone loss and increased risk of osteoporosis (OP). Similarly, cancers and metastasis to bone showed a close relationship with sex hormones (particularly estrogen). Thus, these findings raise a question: Could pre-existing estrogen deficiency OP promote and/or influence cancer cell homing and tumor growth in bone? Although some preclinical and clinical evidence exists, it is mandatory to understand this aspect that would be relevant in the clinical theatre, where physicians need to understand the treatments available to reduce the risk of skeletal disease in cancer patients. This descriptive systematic review summarizes preclinical and clinical studies dealing with bimodal interactions between pre-existing estrogen deficiency OP and bone metastasis development and provides evidence supporting differences in tumor growth and colonization between healthy and OP status. Few studies evaluated the impact of estrogen deficiency OP on the susceptibility to bone metastases. Therefore, implementing biological knowledge, could help researchers and clinicians to have a better comprehension of the importance of pre- and post-menopausal bone microenvironment and its clinical implications for precision medicine in cancer patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Immunotherapies are some of the most promising emergent treatments for several cancers, yet there remains a majority of patients who do not benefit from them due to immune-resistant tumors. One avenue for enhancing treatment for these patients is by converting these tumors to an immunoreactive state, thereby restoring treatment efficacy. By leveraging regulatory networks we previously characterized in autoimmunity, here we show that overexpression of the master regulator IKZF1 leads to enhanced immune infiltrate recruitment and tumor sensitivity to PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors in several tumors that normally lack IKZF1 expression. This work provides proof of concept that tumors can be rendered susceptible by hijacking immune cell recruitment signals through molecular master regulators. On a broader scale, this work also demonstrates the feasibility of using computational approaches to drive the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms toward treatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[Classical immunoassays are routinely performed in the clinic for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Recent advances in phenotyping technologies offer huge potential in expanding the breadth of immune response monitoring. Challenges remain, however, in translating many of these tools to routine clinical practice. This Opinion focuses on two strategies that may advance the clinical adoption of immune-based biomarkers: protein-based assays employing digital readouts can reduce nonspecific signals that limit more classical assays; and approaches that stimulate immune responses in more standardized ways can help to reveal disease-specific immune response signatures by elevating the signal above the background. The integration of such immune response phenotypes is a critical step for the increased implementation of precision medicine-based strategies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objectives(#br)The conceptual models underlying physical activity interventions have been based largely on differences between more and less active people. Yet physical activity is a dynamic behavior, and such models are not sensitive to factors that regulate behavior at a momentary level or how people respond to individual attempts at intervening. We demonstrate how a control systems engineering approach can be applied to develop personalized models of behavioral responses to an intensive text message-based intervention.(#br)Design(#br)& Method: To establish proof-of-concept for this approach, 10 adults wore activity monitors for 16 weeks and received five text messages daily at random times. Message content was randomly selected from three types of messages designed to target (1) social-cognitive processes associated with increasing physical activity, (2) social-cognitive processes associated with reducing sedentary behavior, or (3) general facts unrelated to either physical activity or sedentary behavior. A dynamical systems model was estimated for each participant to examine the magnitude and timing of responses to each type of text message.(#br)Results(#br)Models revealed heterogeneous responses to different message types that varied between people and between weekdays and weekends.(#br)Conclusions(#br)This proof-of-concept demonstration suggests that parameters from this model can be used to develop personalized algorithms for intervention delivery. More generally, these results demonstrate the potential utility of control systems engineering models for optimizing physical activity interventions.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a recently identified high-risk subtype of B-lineage ALL (B-ALL), characterized by a gene expression profile similar to that of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL, but without the hallmark BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Ph-like ALL represents approximately 15% of childhood ALL and its frequency rises with age, peaking among adolescents and young adults with B-ALL. This subtype is associated with adverse clinical features, persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) and a poor prognosis despite modern chemotherapy regimens. While Ph-like ALL lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion, it is characterized by a diverse spectrum of kinase fusions and cytokine receptor gene rearrangements that may be similarly amenable to molecularly targeted therapies. While survival rates for childhood ALL have drastically improved with intensive conventional chemotherapy, Ph-like ALL represents a novel paradigm of precision medicine in ALL. This review aims to provide an update of the genetic basis of Ph-like ALL and to illustrate how these findings can translate into tailored targeted therapies with the hopes of improving the outcomes of Ph-like ALL patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objective(#br)Big Data is widely seen as a major opportunity for progress in the practice of personalized medicine, attracting the attention from medical societies and presidential teams alike as it offers a unique opportunity to enlarge the base of evidence, especially for older patients underrepresented in clinical trials. This study prospectively assessed the real-time availability of clinical cases in the Health & Research Informatics Total Cancer Care™ (TCC) database matching community patients with cancer, and the impact of such a consultation on treatment.(#br)Materials and Methods(#br)Patients aged 70 and older seen at the Lynn Cancer Institute (LCI) with a documented malignancy were eligible. Geriatric screening information and the oncologist's pre-consultation treatment plan were sent to Moffitt. A search for similar patients was done in TCC and additional information retrieved from Electronic Medical Records. A report summarizing the data was sent and the utility of such a consultation was assessed per email after the treatment decision.(#br)Results(#br)Thirty one patients were included. The geriatric screening was positive in 87.1% (27) of them. The oncogeriatric consultation took on average 2.2 working days. It influenced treatment in 38.7% (12), and modified it in 19.4% (6). The consultation was perceived as “somewhat” to “very useful” in 83.9% (26).(#br)Conclusion(#br)This study establishes a proof of concept of the feasibility of real time use of Big Data for clinical practice. The geriatric screening and the consultation report influenced treatment in 38.7% of cases and modified it in 19.4%, which compares very well with oncogeriatric literature. Additional steps are needed to render it financially and clinically viable.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)A method for the production of liquid capsules with the potential of modifying drug dose and release is presented. For the first time, the co-ordinated use of fused deposition modelling (FDM), 3D printing and liquid dispensing to fabricate individualised dosage form on demand in a fully automated fashion has been demonstrated. Polymethacrylate shells (Eudragit EPO and RL) for immediate and extended release were fabricated using FDM 3D printing and simultaneously filled using a computer-controlled liquid dispenser loaded with model drug solution (theophylline) or suspension (dipyridamole). The impact of printing modes: simultaneous shell printing and filling (single-phase) or sequential 3D printing of shell bottom, filling and shell cap (multi-phase), nozzle size, syringe volume, and shell structure has been reported. The use of shell thickness of 1.6 mm, and concentric architecture allowed successful containment of liquid core whilst maintaining the release properties of the 3D printed liquid capsule. The linear relationship between the theoretical and the actual volumes from the dispenser reflected its potential for accurate dosing (R 2 = 0.9985). Modifying the shell thickness of Eudragit RL capsule allowed a controlled extended drug release without the need for formulation change. Owing to its low cost and versatility, this approach can be adapted to wide spectrum of liquid formulations such as small and large molecule solutions and obviate the need for compatibility with the high temperature of FDM 3D printing process. In a clinical setting, health care staff will be able to instantly manufacture in small volumes liquid capsules with individualised dose contents and release pattern in response to specific patient's needs.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Pancreatic cancer is resistant to treatment and needs precision individualized therapy to improve the outcome of this disease. Previously, we demonstrated that trametinib (TRA), a MEK inhibitor, could inhibit a pancreatic cancer patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX). In the present study, we show that gemcitabine (GEM) in combination with TRA was more effective than TRA alone. We implanted a patient pancreatic cancer orthotopically in the pancreatic tail of nude mice to establish the PDOX model. After seven weeks of tumor growth, we divided 32 pancreatic-cancer PDOX nude mice into 4 groups of eight: untreated control; GEM (once a week for 2 weeks); TRA (14 consecutive days); GEM + TRA (GEM: once a week for 2 weeks, TRA:14 consecutive days). We found that treated mice on day 14 had significantly reduced tumor volume in comparison to untreated control. TRA and the combination of GEM + TRA therapy significantly inhibited tumor development in comparison to GEM alone. However, GEM + TRA inhibited the PDOX tumor growth significantly greater than TRA alone. These results suggest the clinical potential of the combination of TRA and GEM for pancreatic cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)The increasing use of mAbs has led to a rise in hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), which prevent their use as first-line therapy. HSRs' symptoms, diagnostic tools, and directed management approaches have not been standardized.(#br)Objective(#br)We propose a novel evidence-based classification of HSRs to mAbs, based on the clinical phenotypes, underlying endotypes and biomarkers, as well as their management with desensitization.(#br)Methods(#br)Phenotypes, endotypes, and biomarkers of HSRs to 16 mAbs for 104 patients were described and compared with the outcomes of 526 subcutaneous and intravenous desensitizations.(#br)Results(#br)Initial reactions presented with 4 patterns: type I–like reactions (63%), cytokine-release reactions (13%), mixed reactions (21%), and delayed type IV reactions (3%). In contrast, of the 23% breakthrough HSRs during desensitization, 52% were cytokine-release reactions, 32% were type 1, 12% were mixed, and 4% were type I with delayed type IV. Skin testing to 10 mAbs in 58 patients was positive in 41% of patients. Serum tryptase was elevated in 1 patient and IL-6 was elevated in 8 patients during desensitization and was associated with a cytokine-release phenotype.(#br)Conclusions(#br)HSRs to mAbs can be defined as type I, cytokine-release, mixed (type I/cytokine-release), and type IV reactions, which are identified by biomarkers such as skin test, tryptase, and IL-6. These phenotypes can be used to improve personalized and precision medicine when diagnosing HSRs to mAbs and providing management recommendations with desensitization. Desensitization provides a safe and effective retreatment option to remain on culprit mAbs as first-line therapy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The rapid progress in “omics”, such as genomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, has paved the path for precision medicine and revolutionized the development of drugs and devices promising to meet unmet medical needs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the current regulatory framework established by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and to identify challenges and concerns through study of related literatures in the PubMed database. We found that efforts were made to facilitate the implementation of precision medicine through organizational reform, publication of guidance documents, and continuous post-market surveillance. The challenges identified included the critical, fundamental structural requirements of databases, essential regulatory considerations for market approval, and the appropriate clinical use such as whole genomic sequencing tests especially for a newborn or even fetus. These issues are worth further research to devise an integral approach involving scientific, ethical, legal, and social considerations.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)The advent of direct electron detectors has enabled the routine use of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (EM) approaches to determine structures of a variety of protein complexes at near-atomic resolution. Here, we report the development of methods to account for local variations in defocus and beam-induced drift, and the implementation of a data-driven dose compensation scheme that significantly improves the extraction of high-resolution information recorded during exposure of the specimen to the electron beam. These advances enable determination of a cryo-EM density map for β-galactosidase bound to the inhibitor phenylethyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside where the ordered regions are resolved at a level of detail seen in X-ray maps at ∼ 1.5 Å resolution. Using this density map in conjunction with constrained molecular dynamics simulations provides a measure of the local flexibility of the non-covalently bound inhibitor and offers further opportunities for structure-guided inhibitor design.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Remarkable advances in quantitative mass spectrometry have shifted the focus of proteomics from the characterization of protein expression profiles to detailed investigations on the spatial and temporal organization of the proteome. Demands for precision therapy and personalized medicine are challenged by heterogeneity in the larger population, which have led to drawbacks in biomarker performance and therapeutic efficacy. The consistent adaptation of the cellular proteome in response to distinctive signals defines a phenotype. Acquisition of quantitative multi-layered omics data on multiple individuals over defined time scales has made it possible to establish means to probe the extent to which the genome, transcriptome and environment influence the variability of the proteome in given conditions, over time. Comprehensive, reproducible datasets generated with contemporary quantitative, massively parallel, targeted proteomic approaches offer as yet untapped benefits for biomarker discovery, development, and validation. The objective of this review is to recapitulate on advances in targeted proteomics approaches for quantifying the cellular proteome and to address ways to incorporate these data towards improving present day methodologies for biomarker evaluation and precision medicine.(#br)Significance(#br)Advances in quantitative mass spectrometry have shifted the focus of proteomics from the characterization of protein expression profiles to detailed investigations on the spatial and temporal organization of the proteome. This review expounds on avenues through which targeted proteomic methodologies can be constructively implemented in translational research and precision medicine to overcome existing challenges that hinder the success of protein biomarkers in clinics, and to develop precise therapeutics for future applications.]]>

          <![CDATA[Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Most diseases, especially cancer, would significantly benefit from precision medicine where treatment is shaped for the individual. The concept of theragnostics or theranostics emerged around 2002 to describe the incorporation of diagnostic assays into the selection of therapy for this purpose. Increasingly, theranostics has been used for strategies that combine noninvasive imaging-based diagnostics with therapy. Within the past decade theranostic imaging has transformed into a rapidly expanding field that is located at the interface of diagnosis and therapy.(#br)A critical need in cancer treatment is to minimize damage to normal tissue. Molecular imaging can be applied to identify targets specific to cancer with imaging, design agents against these targets to visualize their delivery, and monitor response to treatment, with the overall purpose of minimizing collateral damage. Genomic and proteomic profiling can provide an extensive ‘fingerprint’ of each tumor. With this cancer fingerprint, theranostic agents can be designed to personalize treatment for precision medicine of cancer, and minimize damage to normal tissue. Here, for the first time, we have introduced the term ‘metabolotheranostics’ to describe strategies where disease-based alterations in metabolic pathways detected by MRS are specifically targeted with image-guided delivery platforms to achieve disease-specific therapy. The versatility of MRI and MRS in molecular and functional imaging makes these technologies especially important in theranostic MRI and ‘metabolotheranostics’. Our purpose here is to provide insights into the capabilities and applications of this exciting new field in cancer treatment with a focus on MRI and MRS.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Introduction(#br)Brain tissue hypoxia may contribute to preventable secondary brain injury after cardiac arrest. We developed a porcine model of opioid overdose cardiac arrest and post-arrest care including invasive, multimodal neurological monitoring of regional brain physiology. We hypothesized brain tissue hypoxia is common with usual post-arrest care and can be prevented by modifying mean arterial pressure (MAP) and arterial oxygen concentration (PaO 2 ).(#br)Methods(#br)We induced opioid overdose and cardiac arrest in sixteen swine, attempted resuscitation after 9 min of apnea, and randomized resuscitated animals to three alternating 6-h blocks of standard or titrated care. We invasively monitored physiological parameters including brain tissue oxygen (PbtO 2 ). During standard care blocks, we maintained MAP > 65 mmHg and oxygen saturation 94–98%. During titrated care, we targeted PbtO2 > 20 mmHg.(#br)Results(#br)Overall, 10 animals (63%) achieved ROSC after a median of 12.4 min (range 10.8–21.5 min). PbtO 2 was higher during titrated care than standard care blocks (unadjusted β = 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42–0.78, P < 0.001). In an adjusted model controlling for MAP, vasopressors, sedation, and block sequence, PbtO 2 remained higher during titrated care (adjusted β = 0.75, 95%CI 0.43–1.06, P < 0.001). At three predetermined thresholds, brain tissue hypoxia was significantly less common during titrated care blocks (44 vs 2% of the block duration spent below 20 mmHg, P < 0.001; 21 vs 0% below 15 mmHg, P < 0.001; and, 7 vs 0% below 10 mmHg, P = .01).(#br)Conclusions(#br)In this model of opioid overdose cardiac arrest, brain tissue hypoxia is common and treatable. Further work will elucidate best strategies and impact of titrated care on functional outcomes.]]>

Although genetic mutations are progressively delineated, comprehensive molecular phenotyping of ichthyotic skin could suggest much-needed pathogenesis-based therapy.(#br)Objective(#br)To profile the molecular fingerprint of the most common orphan ichthyoses.(#br)Methods(#br)Gene, protein, and serum studies were performed on skin and blood samples from 29 patients (congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma/CIE, n=9; lamellar ichthyosis/LI, n=8; epidermolytic ichthyosis/EI, n=8; and Netherton syndrome/NS, n=4), as well as age-matched healthy controls (n=14), psoriasis (n=30), and atopic dermatitis/AD (n=16) patients.(#br)Results(#br)Using fold-change>2 and false-discovery-rate<0.05 criteria, 132 differentially expressed genes/DEGs were commonly shared among all ichthyoses, including many IL-17 and TNFα co-regulated genes, considered hallmarks of psoriasis (DEFB4A, KYNU, VNN3). While striking up-regulation of Th17 pathway genes (IL17F, IL36B/G), resembling psoriasis, was common to all ichthyoses in a severity-related manner, NS showed greatest T-cell activation (ICOS) and a broader immune phenotype with Th1/IFNγ, OASL, and Th2/IL4R/IL5 skewing, albeit less than AD (all P<0.05). Ichthyoses lacked the epidermal differentiation and tight junction alterations of AD (LOR, FLG, CLDN 1), but showed characteristic alterations in lipid metabolism genes (ELOVL3, GAL), with parallel reductions in extracellular lipids and corneocyte compaction in all ichthyoses except EI, suggesting phenotypic variations. TEWL, a functional barrier measure, significantly correlated with IL-17-regulated genes (IL-17F, IL-36α/IL-36β/IL-36γ).(#br)Conclusion(#br)Similar to AD and psoriasis where cytokine dysregulation and barrier impairment orchestrate disease phenotypes, psoriasis-like immune dysregulation and lipid alterations characterize the ichthyoses. These data support the testing of IL-17/IL-36-targeted therapeutics for ichthyosis patients, similar to psoriasis.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) relies on clinical features and lags behind the current understanding of the molecular specificity of disease pathobiology, necessitating approaches that incorporate growing biomedical data for classifying diseases to meet the needs of precision medicine. Our analysis revealed that the heterogeneous molecular diversity of disease chapters and the blurred boundary between disease categories in ICD should be further investigated. Here, we propose a new classification of diseases (NCD) by developing an algorithm that predicts the additional categories of a disease by integrating multiple networks consisting of disease phenotypes and their molecular profiles. With statistical validations from phenotype-genotype associations and interactome networks, we demonstrate that NCD improves disease specificity owing to its overlapping categories and polyhierarchical structure. Furthermore, NCD captures the molecular diversity of diseases and defines clearer boundaries in terms of both phenotypic similarity and molecular associations, establishing a rational strategy to reform disease taxonomy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Purposes(#br)Hydrops fetalis is a life-threatening fetal condition, and 85% of all cases are classified as nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF). Up to 15% of NIHF cases may be due to inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), but a large proportion of cases linked to metabolic disorders remains undiagnosed. This lack of diagnosis may be related to the limitations of conventional biological procedures, which involve sequential investigations and require multiple samples and steps. In addition, this approach is time consuming. We have developed a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel to investigate metabolic causes of NIHF, ascites, and polyhydramnios associated to another fetal abnormality.(#br)Methods(#br)The hydrops fetalis (HydFet) panel was designed to cover the coding regions and flanking intronic sequences of 41 genes. A retrospective study of amniotic fluid samples from 40 subjects was conducted. A prospective study was subsequently initiated, and six samples were analyzed using the NGS panel.(#br)Results(#br)Five IEM diagnoses were made using the HydFet panel (Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), Barth syndrome, HNF1Β deficiency, GM1 gangliosidosis, and Gaucher disease). This analysis also allowed the identification of 8p sequence triplication in an additional case.(#br)Conclusion(#br)NGS combined with robust bioinformatics analyses is a useful tool for identifying the causative variants of NIHF. Subsequent functional characterization of the protein encoded by the altered gene and morphological studies may confirm the diagnosis. This paradigm shift allows a significant improvement of IEM diagnosis in NIHF.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The microbiome not only represents a vital modifier of health and disease, but is a clinically important drug target. Therefore, study of the impact of the human microbiome on drug metabolism, toxicity and efficacy is urgently needed. This review focuses on gut and vaginal microbiomes, and the effect of those microbiomes or components thereof on the pharmacokinetics of specific chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapies, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs. In some cases, the presence of specific bacterial species within the microbiome can alter the metabolism of certain drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents and antiviral drugs. These microbiota–drug interactions are identified mostly through studies using germ-free or microbiome-depleted animal models, or by the administration of specific bacterial isolates. The biotransformation of drugs can cause drug-related toxicities; however, biotransformation also provides a mechanism by which drug developers could exploit host microbiota to create more site-specific drugs. Within this review we consider the importance of the route of drug administration and interactions with microbiota at various mucosal sites. Notably, we discuss the potential utility of bacterial therapeutics in altering the microbiome to enhance therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcomes in a personalized fashion. Based on the data to date, there is a clinically important relationship between microbiota and drug metabolism throughout the lifespan; therefore, profiling of the human microbiome will be essential in order to understand the mechanisms by which these microbiota–drug interactions occur and the degree to which this complex interplay affects drug efficacy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Despite advances in cancer biology and therapeutics, drug resistance remains problematic. Resistance is often multifactorial, heterogeneous, and prone to undersampling. Nonetheless, many individual mechanisms of targeted therapy resistance may coalesce into a smaller number of convergences, including pathway reactivation (downstream re-engagement of original effectors), pathway bypass (recruitment of a parallel pathway converging on the same downstream output), and pathway indifference (development of a cellular state independent of the initial therapeutic target). Similar convergences may also underpin immunotherapy resistance. Such parsimonious, convergence-based frameworks may help explain resistance across tumor types and therapeutic categories and may also suggest strategies to overcome it.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The genomic fusion of two genes can lead to the expression of a fusion protein that can have oncogenic potential. The important contribution of such fusion genes to oncogenesis and tumour progression is being increasingly recognised. Here we report the presence of a novel VANGL2-ITLN1 fusion gene in the IMR32 neuroblastoma cell line. The fusion gene was identified by applying FusionHunter analysis to neuroblastoma cell line RNA sequencing data. This fusion results in the dramatic overexpression of a fusion transcript incorporating the full length ITLN1 coding sequence. Furthermore, the tumour expression levels of both components of the fusion gene (ITLN1 and VANGL2) are predictive of neuroblastoma patient outcome. High ITLN1 expression levels correlate with worse outcome across all neuroblastoma tumour stages and across MYCN amplification statuses. Survival probability was markedly worse for patients with both elevated MYCN and ITLN1 expression. We show that the VANGL2-ITLN1 fusion transcript can be transcriptionally upregulated upon lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment, a known agonist of the Wnt signalling pathway. The novel VANGL2-ITLN1 fusion is associated with regulatory networks such as MYCN, ALK and the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway which are key regulators of neuroblastoma outcome. We reveal novel putative multilevel-interactions between the fusion gene components and the MYCN oncogene, including MYCN ITLN protein-protein interactions. Through its interactions with other oncogenes the VANGL2-ITLN1 fusion gene is likely to be involved in driving neuroblastoma progression and poor patient outcomes.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The aggressive B-cell lymphomas are a diverse collection of cancers grouped together based on clinical behavior and derivation from B lymphocytes. Genomic analyses on these tumours are now translating into improved classification systems and identification of underpinning targetable biology. Simple karyotyping revealed key translocations involving MYC , BCL2 , and BCL6 that have impacted lymphoma classification in the World Health Organization classification scheme. Subsequently, gene expression profiling identified molecular subgroups within the most common lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): activated B-cell-like and germinal center B-cell-like. Finally, next generation sequencing has revealed a modest number of frequently mutated genes and a long list of infrequent mutations. The mutational landscapes involve diverse genes associated with dysregulated signaling, epigenetic modification, blockade of cellular differentiation, and immune evasion. These mutational “signatures” are enriched in the different aggressive lymphoma subtypes impacting phenotypes and identifying therapeutic targets. Challenges to implementing genomic assays into clinical practice remain.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Our current understanding of the pathophysiology and management of sepsis is associated with a lack of progress in clinical trials, which partly reflects insufficient appreciation of the heterogeneity of this syndrome. Consequently, more patient-specific approaches to treatment should be explored.(#br)Aims(#br)To summarize the current evidence on precision medicine in sepsis, with an emphasis on translation from theory to clinical practice. A secondary objective is to develop a framework enclosing recommendations on management and priorities for further research.(#br)Sources(#br)A global search strategy was performed in the MEDLINE database through the PubMed search engine (last search December 2017). No restrictions of study design, time, or language were imposed.(#br)Content(#br)The focus of this Position Paper is on the interplay between therapies, pathogens, and the host. Regarding the pathogen, microbiologic diagnostic approaches (such as blood cultures (BCs) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)) are discussed, as well as targeted antibiotic treatment. Other topics include the disruption of host immune system and the use of biomarkers in sepsis management, patient stratification, and future clinical trial design. Lastly, personalized antibiotic treatment and stewardship are addressed (Fig. 1).(#br)Implications(#br)A road map provides recommendations and future perspectives. RDTs and identifying drug-response phenotypes are clear challenges. The next step will be the implementation of precision medicine to sepsis management, based on theranostic methodology. This highly individualized approach will be essential for the design of novel clinical trials and improvement of care pathways.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that is involved in the regulation of all major biological processes in cells. As a rapid and reversible means to modulate protein activity and transduce signals, aberrant protein phosphorylation is implicated in the onset and progression of most cancer types. Therefore, pharmacological inhibitors against protein kinases are highly pursued therapeutic approaches for treating cancer. Phosphoproteomics has become an important approach for investigating protein phosphorylation, and it is a technique that provides measurements of kinase pathway activation and the circuitry of signalling networks with both spatial and temporal resolution. Combined with the recent advances in mass spectrometry and development in biochemical procedures for phosphopeptide enrichment and computational approaches, high-throughput phosphoproteomics enables the investigation of kinase signalling networks with unprecedented depth. Here, we review the recent progresses in phosphoproteomics methodology and how phosphoproteomics profiling could be implemented in translational research to aid cancer therapies, facilitate novel drug target discovery and overcome the therapeutic obstacles caused by drug resistance.(#br)Significance(#br)In this review, we summarized the recent progress in mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics and discussed how phosphoproteomics profiling can be implemented in translational research to aid cancer therapies, facilitate novel drug target discovery and overcome the therapeutic obstacles caused by drug resistance due to the rapid remodelling of signalling networks in response to kinase inhibitor treatment. In addition, we addressed the insights and challenges of applying MS phosphoproteomics in clinical routine practice in precision medicine. This review will help readers become more familiar with the recent advancements and applications of phosphoproteomics, especially in the field of kinase-targeted cancer therapy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Breast cancer is a multistep, multifactorial, and heterogeneous disease. Significant transformations have occurred in the systemic management of breast cancer in the past decade. Due to the further understanding of pathogenesis, scientists have found plenty of signaling pathways and correspondingly therapeutic targets in breast cancer, such as hormone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6), poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and programmed death-1 (PD-1). Targeted therapy, which optimizes the accuracy of antitumor activity and minimizes toxicity to normal tissues, plays a crucial role in breast cancer treatment in the era of precision medicine. In this review, we aimed to summarize the latest developments in targeted therapy for breast cancer and discuss the existing problems.]]>

In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, highlighting the kinetics of cancer stem cell and the role of the epithelial mesenchymal transition for metastasis. It appears that the tumor micro-environment plays a crucial role in triggering phenotypic transitions, as we illustrate discussing the challenges posed by macrophages and cancer associated fibroblasts. To disentangle the complexity of environmentally induced phenotypic transitions, there is a growing need for novel advanced algorithms as those proposed in our recent work combining single cell data analysis and numerical simulations of gene regulatory networks.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs) are complex conditions, which arise from the interaction between a genetic susceptibility and unknown environmental triggers. They represent a relevant cause of liver failure and liver transplantation worldwide. As a testimony of our progress in understanding the biology of AILDs and the disease progression is the overall median survival which has increased over the last decade. However, there are still major challenges such as the lack of therapies and surveillance strategies in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), the management and treatment of non-responders to first-line therapies in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and the need for tailoring immunosuppressive drugs in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The different disease course and treatment response in patients with AILDs might be related to a heterogeneous genetic background between individuals which translates in a heterogeneous clinical phenotype. Thus, it becomes essential to personalise management and treatment based on specific risk profiles, e.g. low-risk and high-risk, based on genetic and molecular signatures.(#br)It is now possible, thanks to the development of large-scale AILDs patient cohorts, that such diseases can be analysed using various high-throughput methods like gene expression profiling, next generation sequencing and other omics technologies to identify unique fingerprints based on which a personalised or tailor-made management and therapy can be developed. The final aim being to facilitate treatment decision-making that balances patient-specific risks and preferences. This is critical especially now with the current and forthcoming availability of more efficacious medications. To reach this point we need specific interventions such as creating bigger biobanks, sequencing more genomes and linking biological information to health-related data.(#br)We have already identified subsets of patients with different risk profiles among patients with PBC, PSC and AIH by using clinical tools such as liver histology, laboratory investigation and non-invasive methods. In this manuscript, we review the clinical features and investigations that already enable us to individualize the care of PBC patients and that might support the development of precision medicine (PM) in AILDs.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Asthma is a common disease, and although its clinical manifestations may be similar among patients, recent research discoveries have shown that it consists of several distinct clinical clusters or phenotypes, each with different underlying molecular pathways yielding different treatment responses. Based on these observations, an alternative approach - known as ‘precision medicine’ - has been proposed for the management of patients with severe asthma. Precision medicine advocates identification of treatable traits, linking them to therapeutic approaches targeting genetic, immunological, environmental, and/or lifestyle factors in individual patients. The main “goal” of this personalised approach is to enable choosing a treatment which will be more likely to produce a beneficial response in the individual patient rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach. The aim of the present review is to discuss different ways of phenotyping asthma and to provide a rationale for treatment algorithms based on principles of precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The aim of the present study was to understand whether modeling brain function in terms of network structure makes it possible to find markers of prediction of motor learning performance in a sensory motor learning task. By applying graph theory indexes of brain segregation—such as modularity and transitivity—to functional connectivity data derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, we further studied pre- (baseline) versus post-task brain network architecture to understand whether motor learning induces changes in functional brain connectivity. The results showed that, after the training session with measurable learning, transitivity increased in the alpha1 EEG frequency band and modularity increased in the theta band and decreased in the gamma band, suggesting that brain segregation is modulated by the cognitive task. Furthermore, it was observed that theta modularity at the baseline negatively correlated with the performance improvement; namely, the lower this connectivity index at the baseline pre-task period, the higher the improvement of performance with training. The present results show that brain segregationis modulated by the cognitive task and that it is possible to predict performance by the study of pre-task EEG rhythm connectivity parameters.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Ceftazidime/avibactam plus aztreonam (CZA+ATM) is an emerging option to combat carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) expressing resistance via multiple β-lactamases within Ambler classes A, B, C, and D. The benefit of this combination is apparent when the pathogen-specific resistance genotype is characterized. However, rapid molecular diagnostic systems may be unavailable to allow this precision medicine-based approach. Using synergy tests with antibiotic gradient diffusion strips (GDS), we aimed to prove that the defined phenotypic profile of CPE is reliably predicted by the genotype to confirm the utility of this method as a phenotypic profiling tool for use in the clinical setting. Synergy assessments for CPE (n=10) that co-produce serine- and metallo-β-lactamases were performed by crossing CZA and ATM antibiotic GDS (Liofilchem ® and ETEST ® ). The MIC:MIC ratio method was also conducted for 5 CPE. All CPE were resistant to CZA and ATM when tested alone. Using classical fractional inhibitory concentration definitions, synergy (9/10) and additivity (1/10) was detected by at least one method for all isolates. As predicted by cross-coverage of genotypically defined serine- and metallo-β-lactamases, for all isolates CZA+ATM produced a phenotypic profile distinguished by sizeable zones of inhibited growth we term the zone of hope. In conclusion, simple procedures utilizing antibiotic GDS were concordant with the known genotypic profile of the CPE selected for study. This approach appears to be a valuable tool for guiding therapy in the absence of molecular diagnostic systems. Furthermore, this study confirms potent in vitro activity of CZA+ATM against CPE expressing multiple β-lactamases.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Numerous novel neuroscience-based drug targets have been identified in recent years. However, it remains unclear how these targets relate to the expression of symptoms in central nervous system (CNS) disorders in general and psychiatric disorders in particular. To discuss this issue, a New Frontiers Meetings of European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) was organized to address the challenges in translational neuroscience research that are impeding the effective development of new treatments.(#br)The main aim of this meeting was to discuss scientific insights, concepts and methodologies in order to improve drug development for psychiatric disorders. The meeting was designed to bring together stakeholders from academia, pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies.(#br)Here we provide a synopsis of the proceedings from the meeting entitled ‘New approaches to psychiatric drug development’. New views on psychiatric drug development were presented to address the challenges and pitfalls as identified by the different stakeholders. The general conclusion of the meeting was that drug discovery could be stimulated by designing new classification and sensitive assessment tools for psychiatric disorders, which bear closer relationships to neuropharmacological and neuroscientific developments. This is in line with the vision of precision psychiatry in which patients are clustered, not merely on symptoms, but primarily on biological phenotypes that represent pathophysiological relevant and ‘drugable’ processes. To achieve these goals, a closer collaboration between all stakeholders in early stages of development is essential to define the research criteria together and to reach consensus on new quantitative biological methodologies and etiology-directed treatments.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Precision medicine guided by comprehensive genome sequencing represents a potential treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer. However, clinical sequencing for pancreatic cancer entails several practical difficulties. We have launched an in-house clinical sequencing system and started genomic testing for patients with cancer in clinical practice. We have analyzed the clinical utility of this system in pancreatic cancer.(#br)Methods(#br)We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with pancreatic cancer who visited our division. Genomic DNA was extracted from both tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the patients. We performed a comprehensive genomic testing using targeted amplicon sequencing for 160 cancer-related genes. The primary endpoints were the detection rates of potential actionable and druggable gene alterations. The secondary endpoints were the detection rate of secondary germline findings, the rate of re-biopsy required for genome sequencing, survival time after the initial visit (post-sequencing survival time), and turnaround time.(#br)Results(#br)Although re-biopsy was required for 25% (5/20) of all patients, genomic testing was performed in all patients. Actionable and druggable gene alterations were detected in 100% (20/20) and 35% (7/20) of patients, respectively, whereas secondary germline findings were detected in 5% (1/20) of patients. The median turnaround times for physicians and patients were 20 and 26 days, respectively. The median post-sequencing survival time was 10.3 months. Only 10% (2/20) of all patients were treated with therapeutic agents based on the outcomes of genomic testing.(#br)Conclusions(#br)The clinical application of comprehensive genomic testing for pancreatic cancer was feasible and promising in clinical practice.]]>

Therefore, cancer risk, prevention, intervention and prognosis determinations have still mainly been based on population, rather than on individualized, evaluations. The objective of this review was to demonstrate that a key mechanism which contributes to the determination is inherent and/or toxicant-provoked reduction in DNA repair capacity. In addition, functional and quantitative determination of DNA repair capacity on an individual basis would dramatically change the evaluation and management of health problems from a population to a personalized basis. In this review, justifications for the scenario were delineated. Topics to be presented include assays for detection of functional DNA repair deficiency, mechanisms for DNA repair defects, toxicant-perturbed DNA repair capacity, epigenetic mechanisms (methylation and miRNA expression) for alteration of DNA repair function, and bioinformatics approach to analyze large amount of genomic data. Information from these topics has recently been and will be used for better understanding of cancer causation and of response to therapeutic interventions. Consequently, innovative genomic- and mechanism-based evidence can be increasingly used to develop more precise cancer risk assessment, and target-specific and personalized medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objectives(#br)The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently altered in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), making this pathway a logical therapeutic target. However, PI3K targeting is not universally effective. Biomarkers of response are needed to stratify patients likely to derive benefit and exclude those unlikely to respond.(#br)Materials and methods(#br)We examined the sensitivity of cell lines with constitutively-active (G12V mutant) HRAS and wild-type HRAS to PI3K inhibition using flow cytometry and cell viability assays. We then overexpressed and silenced HRAS and measured sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor BYL719. Immunoblotting was used to determine activation of the PI3K pathway. MEK and mTOR inhibitors were then tested in HRAS mutant cells to determine their efficacy.(#br)Results(#br)HRAS mutant cell lines were non-responsive to PI3K inhibition. Overexpression of HRAS led to reduced susceptibility to PI3K inhibition, while knockdown improved sensitivity. Immunoblotting revealed suppressed AKT phosphorylation upon PI3K inhibition in both wild-type and HRAS mutant cell lines, however mutant lines maintained phosphorylation of S6, downstream of mTOR. Targeting mTOR effectively reduced viability of HRAS mutant cells and we subsequently examined the ERK-TSC2-mTOR cascade as a mediator of resistance to PI3K inhibition.(#br)Conclusions(#br)HRAS mutant cells are resistant to PI3K inhibition and our findings suggest the involvement of a signalling intersection of the MAPK and PI3K pathways at the level of ERK-TSC2, leading to persistent mTOR activity. mTOR inhibition alone or in combination with MAPK pathway inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for this subset of HNSCC tumors.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Pathologies of the respiratory system such as lung infections, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and lung cancer are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, killing one in six people worldwide. Development of more effective treatments is hindered by the lack of preclinical models of the human lung that can capture the disease complexity, highly heterogeneous disease phenotypes, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed in patients. The merger of two novel technologies, Organs-on-Chips and human stem cell engineering, has the potential to deliver such urgently needed models. Organs-on-Chips, which are microengineered bioinspired tissue systems, recapitulate the mechanochemical environment and physiological functions of human organs while concurrent advances in generating and differentiating human stem cells promise a renewable supply of patient-specific cells for personalized and precision medicine. Here, we discuss the challenges of modeling human lung pathophysiology in vitro , evaluate past and current models including Organs-on-Chips, review the current status of lung tissue modeling using human pluripotent stem cells, explore in depth how stem-cell based Lung-on-Chips may advance disease modeling and drug testing, and summarize practical consideration for the design of Lung-on-Chips for academic and industry applications.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary: Substantial progress has been made in the application of computer-driven methods to provide erythropoietic dosing information for patients with anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease. Initial solutions were simply computerized versions of traditional paper-based anemia management protocols. True personalization was achieved through the use of advanced modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks, physiologic models, and feedback control systems. The superiority of any one technique over another has not been determined, but all methods have shown an advantage in at least one area over the traditional paper expert system used by most dialysis facilities. Improvements in the percentage of hemoglobin measurements within target range, decreased within-subject hemoglobin variability, decreased erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose, and decreased transfusion rates all have been shown.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently develop lupus nephritis (LN), a condition that can lead to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Multiple serum and urine biomarkers for LN have been proposed in recent years, yet none have become incorporated into clinical use. The majority of studies have been single center with significant variability in cohorts, assays, and sample storage, leading to inconclusive results. It has become clear that no single biomarker is likely to be sufficient to diagnose LN, identify flares, and define the response to therapy and prognosis. A more likely scenario is a panel of urine, serum, tissue, and genetic biomarkers. In this review we summarize traditional and novel biomarkers and discuss how they may be utilized in order to bring precision medicine to clinical practice in LN.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precision medicine can be defined as the prevention, investigation and treatment of diseases taking individual variability into account. There are multiple ways in which the field of precision medicine may be advanced; however, recent innovations in the fields of electronics and microfabrication techniques have led to an increased interest in the use of implantable biosensors in precision medicine. Implantable biosensors are an important class of biosensors because of their ability to provide continuous data on the levels of a target analyte; this enables trends and changes in analyte levels over time to be monitored without any need for intervention from either the patient or clinician. As such, implantable biosensors have great potential in the diagnosis, monitoring, management and treatment of a variety of disease conditions. In this review, we describe precision medicine and the role implantable biosensors may have in this field, along with challenges in their clinical implementation due to the host immune responses they elicit within the body.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Next-generation sequencing promises major advancements in precision medicine but faces considerable challenges with insurance coverage. These challenges are especially important to address in oncology in which next-generation tumor sequencing (NGTS) holds a particular promise, guiding the use of life-saving or life-prolonging therapies. Payers’ coverage decision making on NGTS is challenging because this revolutionary technology pushes the very boundaries of the underlying framework used in coverage decisions. Some experts have called for the adaptation of the coverage framework to make it better equipped for assessing NGTS. Medicare’s recent decision to cover NGTS makes this topic particularly urgent to examine. In this article, we discussed the previously proposed approaches for adaptation of the NGTS coverage framework, highlighted their innovations, and outlined remaining gaps in their ability to assess the features of NGTS. We then compared the three approaches with Medicare’s national coverage determination for NGTS and discussed its implications for US private payers as well as for other technologies and clinical areas. We focused on US payers because analyses of coverage approaches and policies in the large and complex US health care system may inform similar efforts in other countries. We concluded that further adaptation of the coverage framework will facilitate a better suited assessment of NGTS and future genomics innovations.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary: Precision medicine is an emerging field that calls for individualization of treatment strategies based on characteristics unique to each patient. In lipid management, current guidelines are driven mainly by clinical trial results that presently indicate that patients with non–dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be treated with a β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, also known as statin therapy. For patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) being treated with hemodialysis, statin therapy has not been shown to successfully reduce poor outcomes in trials and therefore is not recommended. The two major guidelines dissent on whether statin therapy should be of moderate or high intensity in non–dialysis-dependent CKD patients, but often leave the prescribing clinician to make that decision. These decisions often are complicated by the increased concerns for adverse events such as myopathies in patients with advanced kidney disease and ESKD. In the future, there may be an opportunity to further identify CKD and ESKD patients who are more likely to benefit from lipid-modifying therapy as opposed to those who likely will suffer from its side effects using precision medicine tools. For now, data from genetics studies and subgroup analyses may provide insight for future research directions in this field and we review some of the work that has been published in this regard.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has emerged as a paradigm for clinical application of precision medicine as optimal therapy is commonly chosen based on genomic biomarkers identified in a patient’s tumor sample. Recurrent driver alterations are well described, however, a need to continually identify rare variants remains clinically relevant. We identified an incident case of advanced NSCLC with a PDGFR-α N848 K activation loop mutation with no other concurrent oncogenic drivers. Amino acid sequence alignment confirmed homology to the imatinib-sensitive KIT N822 K activation loop mutation observed in GIST. The patient achieved a 2-year response to single agent imatinib that is ongoing. While PDGFR-α N848 K is rare among public sequencing databases our cases strongly suggests functional relevance and highlights the importance of studying rare variants in NSCLC.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health burden. Dialysis is not only costly but may not be readily available in developing countries. Even in highly developed nations, many patients may prefer to defer or avoid dialysis. Thus, alternative options to dialysis therapy or to complement dialysis are needed urgently and are important objectives in CKD management that could have huge clinical and economic implications globally. The role of nutritional therapy as a strategy to slow CKD progression and uremia was discussed as early as the late 19th and early 20th century, but was only seriously explored in the 1970s. There is a revival of interest recently owing to encouraging data as well as the increase of precision medicine with an emphasis on a personalized approach to CKD management. Although part of the explanation for the inconclusive data may relate to variations in study design and dietary prescription, diversity in genetic make-up, variations in the non-nutritional management of CKD, intra-individual variations in responses to dietary and nondietary treatment, psychosocial factors, and dietary compliance issues, these all may contribute to the heterogeneous data and responses. This brings in the evolving concept of precision medicine, in which disease management should be tailored and individualized according not only to clinical manifestations but also to the genetic make-up and biologic responses to therapy, which may vary depending on genetic composition. Precision nutrition management also should take into account patient demographics, social, psychological, education, and compliance factors, which all may influence the therapeutic needs and responses to the nutritional therapy prescribed. In this review, we provide a novel concept of precision medicine in nutritional management in end-stage kidney disease with a transition to dialysis and propose how this may be the way forward for nutritional therapy in the CKD population.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Clinical use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests has been increasing, but few studies have examined their economic value. Several studies have noted that there are methodological challenges to conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests.(#br)Objective(#br)Our objective was to examine key methodological challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests, prioritize these challenges for future research, and identify how studies have attempted solutions to address these challenges.(#br)Methods(#br)We identified challenges for economic evaluations of NGS tests using prior literature and expert judgment of the co-authors. We used a modified Delphi assessment to prioritize challenges, based on importance and probability of resolution. Using a structured literature review and article extraction we then assessed whether published economic evaluations had addressed these challenges.(#br)Results(#br)We identified 11 challenges for conducting economic evaluations of NGS tests. The experts identified three challenges as the top priorities for future research: complex model structure, timeframe, and type of analysis and comparators used. Of the 15 published studies included in our literature review, four studies described specific solutions relevant to five of the 11 identified challenges.(#br)Conclusions(#br)Major methodological challenges to economic evaluations of NGS tests remain to be addressed. Our results can be used to guide future research and inform decision-makers on how to prioritize research on the economic assessment of NGS tests.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary: Chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is common in end-stage renal disease and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Mainstays of treatment include decreasing serum phosphorus level toward the normal range with dietary interventions and phosphate binders and treating increased parathyroid hormone levels with activated vitamin D and/or calcimimetics. There is significant variation in serum levels of mineral metabolism markers, intestinal absorption of phosphorus, and therapeutic response among individual patients and subgroups of patients with end-stage renal disease. This variation may be partly explained by polymorphisms in genes associated with calcium and phosphorus homeostasis such as the calcium-sensing receptor gene, the vitamin D–binding receptor gene, and genes associated with vascular calcification. In this review, we discuss how personalized medicine may be used for the management of CKD-MBD and how it ultimately may lead to improved clinical outcomes. Although genetic variants may seem attractive targets to tailor CKD-MBD therapy, complete understanding of how these polymorphisms function and their clinical utility and applicability to personalized medicine need to be determined.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary: Successful renal transplantation is a highly effective endeavor that improves and prolongs the lives of patients with chronic kidney disease. Transplant surgery and immunosuppression carries risk and the demand for donor kidneys outstrips supply by far. These realities mandate thoughtful allocation and utilization of this limited resource to select candidates. As the criteria for candidates and donor grafts continue to expand, the field must adapt and seek new approaches. The complex process—from evaluation of candidates, transplant surgery, immunosuppression, and follow-up care after transplantation—is, of necessity, tightly structured and regulated. However, each patient has distinctive characteristics that must be taken into account to optimize individual outcomes. The personalized approach to renal transplantation, which uses precision medicine concepts, identifies unique aspects of candidates/recipients that require consideration using a combination of time-honored guidelines, emerging concepts, new medications, and refinements of care.]]>

          <![CDATA[In 2006, the group of Dr C.M. Lieber pioneered the field of nanowire sensors by fabricating devices for the ultra-sensitive label-free detection of biological macromolecules. Since then, nanowire sensors have demonstrated their ability to detect cancer-associated analytes in peripheral blood, tumor tissue, and the exhaled breath of cancer patients. These innovative developments have marked a new era with unprecedented detection performance, capable of addressing crucial needs such as cancer diagnosis and monitoring disease progression and patient response to therapy. The ability of nanowire sensors to identify molecular features of patient tumor represents a first step toward precision medicine, and their integration into portable devices has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and patient monitoring.]]>

Since IL-22 blockade showed clinical efficacy only in severe AD, we used baseline median IL22 expression to stratify for high (n=30) and low (n=29) IL22-expression groups. Much stronger mean transcriptomic improvements were seen with fezakinumab in the IL22-high drug group (82.8% and 139.4% at 4 and 12wks, respectively), than in the respective IL22-high placebo (39.6% and 53.6% at 4 and 12wks) or the IL22-low groups. Significant downregulations of multiple immune pathways, including Th1/CXCL9, Th2/CCL18/CCL22, Th17/CCL20/DEFB4A, and Th22/IL22/S100As, were restricted to the IL22-high drug-group (p<0.05). Consistently, tissue predictors of clinical response were mostly genes involved in T-cell and dendritic cell activation and differentiation.(#br)Conclusions(#br)This is the first report showing a profound effect of IL-22 blockade on multiple inflammatory pathways in AD. These data, supported by the robust effects in patients with high IL22 baseline expression, suggest a central role for IL-22 in AD, indicating the need for a precision medicine approach for improving therapeutic outcomes in AD.(#br)Clinical Implications(#br)Stratification of cytokine expression at baseline might help future precision medicine approaches to effectively treat atopic dermatitis patient subsets that might benefit from IL-22 antagonism or other specific blockers.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC), including encapsulated (E-FVPTC) and infiltrative (I-FVPTC) forms, account for approximately 30% of all PTC. These subtypes demonstrate different biological behavior and molecular profiles when compared to classical PTC. E-FVPTC has low regional recurrence and metastatic potential with a biological behavior similar to that of follicular adenoma. In 2015, a multidisciplinary panel of experts revised the diagnostic terminology for cases of noninvasive E-FVPTC to noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). NIFTP was morphologically defined as a noninvasive follicular patterned neoplasm with nuclear features of PTC and scant nuclear pseudo-inclusions, specifically excluding papillary structures and psammoma bodies. The employment of NIFTP diagnostically has significantly impacted fine needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosis and the associated risk of malignancy employed in reporting thyroid FNA specimens. The emerging literature suggests specific cytomorphologic features more frequently encountered with NIFTP compared to cases of I-FVPTC. This article reviews the cytology literature regarding NIFTP and discusses the significance of this new entity in the practice of thyroid cytopathology.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)A majority of non-small cell lung carcinoma patients present with advanced disease, for which surgical resection is not an option. In such cases, both tissue diagnosis and molecular testing to identify potentially targetable genetic alterations are often performed on cytologic or small histologic biopsy specimens. Numerous recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in non-small cell carcinoma, and they correlate with morphologic subtype. Identified alterations range from single nucleotide variants to mutation burden evaluated across the entire tumour exome. Multiple alterations have been confirmed to be mutually exclusive, oncogenic driver alterations, and several are targetable or potentially targetable with personalized, genotype-directed therapeutic agents. In order to maximize the predictive and prognostic potential of genetic testing, it is important to optimize the use of cytologic biopsy specimens. Multiple methods are available for cytologic biopsy material triage and nucleic acid extraction, including cytologic cell blocks, direct smear preparations, and cell free nucleic acid.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently marked 10 years since first updating the labeling for warfarin (often referred to as the “poster child” of pharmacogenomics) to include information regarding the potential impact of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variation on warfarin dosing requirements and risks. Herein, we opine on the experience updating the warfarin labeling, highlighting more generally the enabling factors and challenges encountered when considering incorporation of pharmacogenomic information into the prescribing recommendations for already approved drugs.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)A sizeable proportion of patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) shows a unique adaptive immune system profile, associated to a worse outcome, characterized by higher CD4 + CD28 null T-cells, lower regulatory T-cells (Treg) and increased CD4 + CD28 null /Treg ratio. We sought to investigate the correlation between CD4 + CD28 null T-cells, Treg, CD4 + CD28 null /Treg ratio and plaque phenotype as assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).(#br)Methods(#br)Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from 30 Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients, sub-grouped according to OCT analysis of culprit lesions into two cohorts: Ruptured Fibrous Cap (NSTEMI-RFC, n = 12) and Intact Fibrous Cap (NSTEMI-IFC, n = 18). Stable Angina patients (SA, n = 18) were used as controls. We examined the frequency of CD4 + CD28 null and Treg (defined as CD4 + CD25 high CD127 low Foxp3 + T-cells) by flow-cytometry.(#br)Results(#br)CD4 + CD28 null frequency (median, range) was significantly higher in NSTEMI-RFC patients (17.3%, 12.5–33.8) as compared with NSTEMI-IFC (3.8%, 0.3–14.1) and SA (3%, 0.6–17.7) ( P < 0.001 for all comparisons). We also found a higher CD4 + CD28 null /Treg ratio in NSTEMI-RFC patients (6.6%, 3.7–13.9) than in NSTEMI-IFC (1.6%, 0.3–5.2) and SA (1.2%, 0.3–8.7) ( P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Finally, there was an inverse correlation between CD4 + CD28 null /Treg ratio and cap-thickness ( R = −0.44; P = 0.002).(#br)Conclusion(#br)Patients with NSTEMI presenting with RFC as culprit lesion at OCT evaluation have a specific perturbation of adaptive immunity, mostly involving CD4 + CD28 null T- cells and Tregs, as compared with patients with IFC and SA. This specific imbalance of T-cells might play a key role in fibrous cap thinning, predisposing atherosclerotic plaque to rupture.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)A key aspect of genomic medicine is to make individualized clinical decisions from personal genomes. We developed a machine-learning framework to integrate personal genomes and electronic health record (EHR) data and used this framework to study abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a prevalent irreversible cardiovascular disease with unclear etiology. Performing whole-genome sequencing on AAA patients and controls, we demonstrated its predictive precision solely from personal genomes. By modeling personal genomes with EHRs, this framework quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of adjusting personal lifestyles given personal genome baselines, demonstrating its utility as a personal health management tool. We showed that this new framework agnostically identified genetic components involved in AAA, which were subsequently validated in human aortic tissues and in murine models. Our study presents a new framework for disease genome analysis, which can be used for both health management and understanding the biological architecture of complex diseases.(#br)Video Abstract(#br)[Display omitted]]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precision medicine has recently emerged as a promising strategy for cancer therapy because it not only specifically targets cancer cells but it also does not have adverse effects on normal cells. Oligonucleotide aptamers are a class of small molecule ligands that can specifically bind to their targets on cell surfaces with high affinity. Aptamers have great potential in precision cancer therapy due to their unique physical, chemical, and biological properties. Therefore, aptamer technology has been widely investigated for biomedical and clinical applications. This review focuses on the potential applications of aptamer technology as a new tool for precision treatment of hematological malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)High-level plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been associated with lower colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Considering evidence indicating immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D, we hypothesised that survival benefits from high systemic vitamin D level might be stronger for colorectal carcinoma with lower immune response to tumour.(#br)Methods(#br)Using 869 colon and rectal cancer cases within the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we assessed the prognostic association of postdiagnosis 25(OH)D score [derived from diet and lifestyle variables to predict plasma 25(OH)D level] in strata of levels of histopathologic lymphocytic reaction. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was adjusted for potential confounders, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2) expression and KRAS , BRAF and PIK3CA mutations.(#br)Results(#br)The association of postdiagnosis 25(OH)D score with colorectal cancer-specific mortality differed by levels of peritumoural lymphocytic reaction ( p interaction = 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted mortality hazard ratios for a quintile-unit increase of 25(OH)D score were 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54–0.89] in cases with negative/low peritumoural lymphocytic reaction, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93–1.26) in cases with intermediate peritumoural reaction and 1.25 (95% CI, 0.75–2.09) in cases with high peritumoural reaction. The survival association of the 25(OH)D score did not significantly differ by Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, intratumoural periglandular reaction or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.(#br)Conclusions(#br)The association between the 25(OH)D score and colorectal cancer survival is stronger for carcinomas with lower peritumoural lymphocytic reaction. Our results suggesting interactive effects of vitamin D and immune response may contribute to personalised dietary and lifestyle intervention strategies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Clinical implementation of two recently approved antisense RNA therapeutics – Exondys51 ® to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne MD) and Spinraza ® as a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) – highlights the therapeutic potential of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). As shown in the Duchenne and Becker cases, the identification and specific removal of ‘dispensable’ exons by exon-skipping ASOs could potentially bypass lethal mutations in other genes and bring clinical benefits to affected individuals carrying amenable mutations. In this review, we discuss the potential of therapeutic alternative splicing, with a particular focus on targeted exon skipping using Duchenne MD as an example, and speculate on new applications for other inherited rare diseases where redundant or dispensable exons may be amenable to exon-skipping ASO intervention as precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Bladder cancer is a widespread and highly heterogeneous malignancy. Moreover, bladder cancer recurrence and treatment failure are common, making this disease a challenge for genito-urinary surgeons. Precision medicine represents a new medical concept and model. It is based on personalized medicine, and employs genomics, proteomics, and other omics and cutting-edge medical technologies to classify disease at the molecular level, enabling accurate identification of its cause and therapeutic targets, ultimately offering precise, personalized medicine. The existence of heterogeneity in bladder cancer, resulting in different molecular phenotypes, constitutes a huge challenge for precision medicine. Studying phenotypic differences will be of substantial clinical significance and far-reaching research value with respect to the natural history of tumor development, reduction of drug resistance, the early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with bladder cancer, and the realization of fully developed precision medicine. This paper reviews the possible mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity and their impact on precision medicine. The manner in which precision medicine may be performed in the presence of bladder cancer heterogeneity and the prospects of this discipline are also discussed.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This paper describes our experience with the development and implementation of a database for the rare disease Alkaptonuria (AKU, OMIM: 203500). AKU is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a gene mutation leading to the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA). Analogously to other rare conditions, currently there are no approved biomarkers to monitor AKU progression or severity. Although some biomarkers are under evaluation, an extensive biomarker analysis has not been undertaken in AKU yet.(#br)In order to fill this gap, we gained access to AKU-related data that we carefully processed, documented and stored in a database, which we named ApreciseKUre. We undertook a suitable statistical analysis by associating every couple of potential biomarkers to highlight significant correlations. Our database is continuously updated allowing us to find novel unpredicted correlations between AKU biomarkers and to confirm system reliability. ApreciseKUre includes data on potential biomarkers, patients’ quality of life and clinical outcomes facilitating their integration and possibly allowing a Precision Medicine approach in AKU. This framework may represent an online tool that can be turned into a best practice model for other rare diseases.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precise targeting with minimal side effects is of particular interest for personalized medicine, although it remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate precision photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizing human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as cellular vehicles to deliver a new activatable photosensitizer (PcS). In vivo real-time optical imaging tests indicated that PcS-loaded MSCs possess excellent tumor-homing properties. More importantly, dye transfer assays confirm that MSCs precisely transfer PcS into human colon cancer cells (HCT116) via the “bystander effect.” Upon localized light irradiation, the growth of intraperitoneal xenograft tumors was significantly inhibited by the photodynamic effect. These findings represent a promising strategy for precise oncotherapy.]]>

          <![CDATA[The classification of genetic variants represents a major challenge in the post-genome era by virtue of their extraordinary number and the complexities associated with ascribing a clinical impact, especially for disorders exhibiting exceptional phenotypic, genetic, and allelic heterogeneity. To address this challenge for hearing loss, we have developed the Deafness Variation Database (DVD), a comprehensive, open-access resource that integrates all available genetic, genomic, and clinical data together with expert curation to generate a single classification for each variant in 152 genes implicated in syndromic and non-syndromic deafness. We evaluate 876,139 variants and classify them as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (more than 8,100 variants), benign or likely benign (more than 172,000 variants), or of uncertain significance (more than 695,000 variants); 1,270 variants are re-categorized based on expert curation and in 300 instances, the change is of medical significance and impacts clinical care. We show that more than 96% of coding variants are rare and novel and that pathogenicity is driven by minor allele frequency thresholds, variant effect, and protein domain. The mutational landscape we define shows complex gene-specific variability, making an understanding of these nuances foundational for improved accuracy in variant interpretation in order to enhance clinical decision making and improve our understanding of deafness biology.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique with therapeutic applications for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The standard protocol uses high frequency stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) identified in a heuristic manner leading to moderate clinical efficacy. A proposed strategy to increase the anatomical precision in targeting, based on resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), identifies the subregion within the DLPFC having the strongest anticorrelated functional connectivity with the subgenual cortex (SGC) for each individual subject.(#br)Objective(#br)In this work, we comprehensively test the reliability and reproducibility of this targeting method for different scan lengths on 100 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) where each subject had a four 15-minute rsfMRI scan on 2 different days.(#br)Methods(#br)We quantified the inter-scan and inter-day distance between the rsfMRI-guided DLPFC targets for each subject controlling for a number of expected sources of noise using volumetric as well as surface analyses.(#br)Results(#br)Our results show that the average inter-day distance (with fMRI scans lasting 30 minutes on each day) is 25% less variable than the inter-scan distance, which uses 50% less data. Specifically, the inter-scan distance was more than 37 mm, while for the longer-scan, the inter-day distance had lower variability at 25 mm. Finally, we tested the same rsfMRI strategy using the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a control region relevant to MDD but less susceptible to artifacts, using both volume and surface rsfMRI data. The results showed similar variability to the SGC-DLPFC functional connectivity. Moreover, our results suggest that a smoothing kernel with 12 mm full-width half maximum (FWHM) lead to more stable and reliable target estimates.(#br)Conclusion(#br)Our work provides a quantitative assessment of the topographic precision of this targeting method, describing an anatomical variability that may surpass the spatial resolution of some forms of focal TMS as it is commonly applied, and provides recommendations for improved accuracy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Although the field of oncology has made significant steps toward individualized precision medicine, cardiology and nephrology still often use a “one size fits all” approach. This applies to the intersection of the heart-kidney interaction and the cardiorenal syndrome as well. Recent studies have shown that the prognostic implications of worsening renal function (WRF) in acute heart failure are variable; thus, there is a need to differentiate the implications of WRF to better guide precise care. This may best be performed with biomarkers that can give the clinician a real-time evaluation of the physiologic state at the time of developing WRF. This review will summarize current cardiac and renal biomarkers and their status in the evaluation of cardiorenal syndrome. Although we have made progress in our understanding of this syndrome, further investigation is needed to bring precision medicine into routine clinical practice for the care of patients with cardiorenal syndrome.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Oral targeted therapies are a growing class of medication. After clinical trials conducted on a selected population, these molecules are usually approved at a fixed dose. However, oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors are characterized by a large intra and inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability, and a narrow therapeutic index. Hence, their prescription is hazardous and unsafe in non-selected people from daily clinical practice. The increasing number of available targeted therapies point out new challenges. These challenges should especially concern prescription for out of the ordinary patients, rules for dose adjustment according to factors of frailty. The ultimate goal is to ensure a safe and individualized prescription. Moreover, many of these molecules are metabolized by the CYP3A4, leading to a serious risk of drug interaction. These interactions might involve not only conventional medicine but also alternative and complementary medicines. These latter are more and more common but oncologists often lack experience about them. Finally, the oral route raises the issues of adherence, and the question of its assessment should now become a permanent part of patients care.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objective(#br)Metformin is the preferred first-line medication for management of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. However, over a third of patients experience primary or secondary therapeutic failure. We developed machine learning models to predict which patients initially prescribed metformin will achieve and maintain control of their blood glucose after one year of therapy.(#br)Materials and methods(#br)We performed a retrospective analysis of administrative claims data for 12,147 commercially-insured adults and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with prediabetes or diabetes. Several machine learning models were trained using variables available at the time of metformin initiation to predict achievement and maintenance of hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) < 7.0% after one year of therapy.(#br)Results(#br)AUC performances based on five-fold cross-validation ranged from 0.58 to 0.75. The most influential variables driving the predictions were baseline HbA 1c , starting metformin dosage, and presence of diabetes with complications.(#br)Conclusions(#br)Machine learning models can effectively predict primary or secondary metformin treatment failure within one year. This information can help identify effective individualized treatment strategies. Most of the implemented models outperformed traditional logistic regression, highlighting the potential for applying machine learning to problems in medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)The association between the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant and statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is well validated, but the clinical utility of its implementation in patient care is unknown.(#br)Design(#br)The Integrating Pharmacogenetics in Clinical Care (I-PICC) Study is a pseudo-cluster randomized controlled trial of SLCO1B1 genotyping among statin-naïve primary care and women's health patients across the Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System. Eligible patients of enrolled primary care providers are aged 40–75 and have elevated risk of cardiovascular disease by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. Patients give consent by telephone in advance of an upcoming appointment, but they are enrolled only if and when their provider co-signs an order for SLCO1B1 testing, performed on a blood sample already collected in clinical care. Enrolled patients are randomly allocated to have their providers receive results through the electronic health record at baseline (PGx + arm) versus after 12 months (PGx- arm). The primary outcome is the change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after one year. Secondary outcomes are concordance with Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for simvastatin prescribing, concordance with ACC/AHA guidelines for statin use, and incidence of SAMS. With 408 patients, the study has >80% power to exclude a between-group LDL-C difference of 10 mg/dL (non-inferiority design) and to detect between-group differences of 15% in CPIC guideline concordance (superiority design).(#br)Conclusion(#br)The outcomes of the I-PICC Study will inform the clinical utility of preemptive SLCO1B1 testing in the routine practice of medicine, including its proposed benefits and unforeseen risks.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Most areas of medicine use biomarkers in some capacity to aid in understanding how personal biology informs clinical care. This article draws upon the Rehabilomics research model as a translational framework for programs of precision rehabilitation and intervention research focused on linking personal biology to treatment response using biopsychosocial constructs that broadly represent function and that can be applied to many clinical populations with disability. The summary applies the Rehabilomics research framework to the population with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and emphasizes a broad vision for biomarker inclusion, beyond typical brain-derived biomarkers, to capture and/or reflect important neurological and non-neurological pathology associated with TBI as a chronic condition. Humoral signaling molecules are explored as important signaling and regulatory drivers of these chronic conditions and their impact on function. Importantly, secondary injury cascades involved in the humoral triad are influenced by the systemic response to TBI and the development of non-neurological organ dysfunction (NNOD). Biomarkers have been successfully leveraged in other medical fields to inform pre-randomization patient selection for clinical trials, however, this practice largely has not been utilized in TBI research. As such, the applicability of the Rehabilomics research model to contemporary clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research designs for neurological and rehabilitation populations is emphasized. Potential points of intervention to modify inflammation, hormonal, or neurotrophic support through rehabilitation interventions are discussed.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Nearly all diseases have a genomic basis. This varies from rare ‘single-gene disorders’ such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, to ‘complex’ or ‘polygenic’ diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus and ulcerative colitis. Cancer is a genomic disease in which tumour evolution is driven by serial acquisition of somatic mutations. Investigation of genetic disorders has been predicated on available technologies, which until recently have been expensive, slow, low-throughput and therefore limited in availability. The technology shift to ‘next-generation sequencing’ has massively expanded the capacity for genomic sequencing, resulting in dramatic advances and opportunities for the clinical application of genomics. Rather than testing genes one by one to identify the underlying cause of a rare paediatric disorder, whole-genome sequencing of all genes in the child and both parents can now be routinely performed as an early investigation. Sequencing of tumour material is routine to identify mutations that provide information related to tumour behaviour, prognosis and response to drugs. Sequencing of pathogen genomes enables tracking of disease outbreaks and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in a substantial minority of emergency room admits. Inexpensive and accurate person-level assessment of PTSD risk after trauma exposure is a critical precursor to large-scale deployment of early interventions that may reduce individual suffering and societal costs. Toward this aim, we applied ensemble machine learning to predict PTSD screening status three months after severe injury using cost-effective and minimally invasive data. Participants ( N = 271) were recruited at a Level 1 Trauma Center where they provided variables routinely collected at the hospital, including pulse, injury severity, and demographics, as well as psychological variables, including self-reported current depression, psychiatric history, and social support. Participant zip codes were used to extract contextual variables including population total and density, average annual income, and health insurance coverage rates from publicly available U.S. Census data. Machine learning yielded good prediction of PTSD screening status 3 months post-hospitalization, AUC = 0.85 95% CI [0.83, 0.86], and significantly outperformed all benchmark comparison models in a cross-validation procedure designed to yield an unbiased estimate of performance. These results demonstrate that good prediction can be attained from variables that individually have relatively weak predictive value, pointing to the promise of ensemble machine learning approaches that do not rely on strong isolated risk factors.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent disease worldwide associated with systemic co-morbidities, representing a significant burden on individuals, their families and society. Therapeutic options for AD remain limited, in part due to lack of well-characterised animal models. To better define pathophysiological mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers that predict therapeutic response, there has been increasing interest in developing experimental approaches to study the pathogenesis of human AD in vivo , in vitro , and in silico . This review critically appraises a range of models including: genetic mutations relevant to AD; experimental challenge of human skin in vivo ; tissue culture models; integration of “omic” datasets; and the development of predictive computational models. Whilst no one individual model recapitulates the complex AD pathophysiology, our review highlights insights gained into key elements of cutaneous biology, molecular pathways and therapeutic target identification through each approach. Recent developments in computational analysis, including the application of machine learning and a systems approach to data integration and predictive modelling, highlight the applicability of these methods to AD subclassification (endotyping), therapy development and precision medicine. Such predictive modelling will highlight knowledge gaps, further inform refinement of biological models, and support new experimental and systems approaches to AD.]]>

Three expression-based scores have been developed, but have not been compared in a prospective validation. We sought to validate these scores using an independent dataset and analysis.(#br)Methods(#br)We generated gene expression profiles from 61 critically ill patients. We validated the performance of 3 expression-based sepsis scores including 1) the Sepsis MetaScore (SMS); 2) the SeptiCyte™ Lab; and 3) the FAIM3:PLAC8 ratio. Sepsis was identified as the presence of definite, probable, or possible infection in the setting of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ≥ 2).(#br)Results(#br)For all 3 models, scores were significantly different between patients with and without sepsis. Discrimination was highest for the SMS (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUROC 0.80 [95% CI 0.67–0.92]), with greater confidence in the presence of infection resulting in better model performance (max AUROC 0.93 [0.87–1.0]).(#br)Conclusions(#br)All three scores distinguished septic from non-septic ICU patients, with the SMS showing the best performance overall in our cohort.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Over the last decades, the increasing technical ability to generate extensive molecular profiles of cancer patient cohorts was accompanied by the notion that anticancer strategies could be tailored to the individual patient, thus giving rise to personalized approaches. Implicit in this development is the need to establish informative molecular profiles to guide clinical decisions. Although at present the richest source of cancer molecular signatures derives from genomic studies, it is the proteome that constitutes the key determinant to the cancer phenotype. Importantly, the proteomic differences distinguishing cancer and control samples can neither be accurately inferred nor predicted. In this respect, mass spectrometry (MS) emerged as a valuable tool to aid further dissection of cancer proteome hallmarks. In this review we highlight the major recent advances in the field of MS and we discuss the contribution of each MS-based platform to address the key pillars of any precision medicine-based anticancer approach.]]>

Identifications of rare cases of monogenic obesity unveiled that hypothalamic circuits and the brain-adipose axis play an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, appetite, hunger and satiety. For example, mutations in the leptin gene cause obesity through almost unsuppressed overeating. Common (multifactorial) obesity, most likely resulting from a concerted interplay of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, is clearly linked to genetic predisposition by multiple risk variants, which, however only account for a minor part of the general BMI variability. Although GWAS opened new avenues in elucidating the complex genetics behind common obesity, understanding the biological mechanisms relative to the specific risk contributing to obesity remains poorly understood. Non-genetic factors such as eating behavior or physical activity strongly modulate the individual risk for developing obesity. These factors may interact with genetic predisposition for obesity through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, here, we review the current knowledge about monogenic and common (multifactorial) obesity highlighting the important recent advances in our knowledge on how epigenetic regulation is involved in the etiology of obesity.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objectives(#br)Although precision medicine is a rapidly-emerging field in healthcare, its growth for the next few decades depends on a number of scientific and economic factors. Policy will play a major role in addressing these factors. In this study, we dynamically simulated the impact of policies related to the two factors—' knowledge sharing and accumulation’ and ‘ reimbursement’ —foregrounded in the literature as having the most significant influence on the growth of precision medicine.(#br)Methods(#br)To analyze the impact of specific policies, we used system dynamics methodology. This allowed us to analyze multiple interaction processes, feedback loops, time delays, and other nonlinear effects.(#br)Results(#br)According to our results, strengthening the knowledge sharing and accumulation policy greatly contributes to the growth of precision medicine by significantly increasing its market share through a complex route. Conversely, strengthening the reimbursement policy only slightly increases precision medicine's market share and is therefore unable to change an industry based on blockbuster drugs.(#br)Conclusions(#br)We conclude that it is preferable to prioritize and actively implement a knowledge sharing and accumulation policy rather than a reimbursement policy. However, knowledge sharing and accumulation policies must be carefully handled in order to avoid individual privacy issues. To prevent such issues, there must be joint cooperation and efforts not only within one country but also among any related countries. Additionally, although reimbursement funding is often scarce and the policy's effects might be limited, a reimbursement policy is needed throughout the development cycle for drug treatments, devices, and supporting diagnostics.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The finalization of the Human Genome Project in 2003 paved the way for a deeper understanding of cancer, favouring a faster progression towards “personalized” medicine. Research in oncology has progressively focused on the sequencing of cancer genomes, to better understand the genetic basis of tumorigenesis and identify actionable alterations to guide cancer therapy. Thanks to the development of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) techniques, sequencing of tumoral DNA is today technically easier, faster and cheaper. Commercially available NGS panels enable the detection of single or global genomic alterations, namely gene mutation and mutagenic burden, both on germline and somatic DNA, potentially predicting the response or resistance to cancer treatments. Profiling of tumor DNA is nowadays a standard in cancer research and treatment. In this review we discuss the history, techniques and applications of NGS in cancer care, under a “personalized tailored therapy” perspective.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)The last two decades of cancer research have seen two major advancements in our ability to treat cancer: precision medicine and immunotherapy. While these approaches have shown striking anticancer efficacy in numerous malignancies, they have not shown similar success and applicability in advanced prostate cancer patients. The fields of precision medicine and immunotherapy have come to realize that targeted therapies are capable of not only inhibiting tumor cell growth, but also promoting antitumor immunity by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Here we examine how personalized medicine can be used to target the tumor immune microenvironment in prostate cancer, with the goal of enhancing clinical responses to immunotherapy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Like virtually all age-related chronic diseases, late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops over an extended preclinical period and is associated with modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors. We hypothesize that multimodal interventions that address many risk factors simultaneously and are individually tailored to patients may help reduce AD risk. We describe a novel clinical methodology used to evaluate and treat patients at two Alzheimer's Prevention Clinics. The framework applies evidence-based principles of clinical precision medicine to tailor individualized recommendations, follow patients longitudinally to continually refine the interventions, and evaluate N-of-1 effectiveness (trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03687710). Prior preliminary results suggest that the clinical practice of AD risk reduction is feasible, with measurable improvements in cognition and biomarkers of AD risk. We propose using these early findings as a foundation to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of personalized risk management within an international network of clinician researchers in a cohort study possibly leading to a randomized controlled trial.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Cardiomyopathy, a leading cause of death worldwide, is etiologically and phenotypically heterogeneous and is caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. Major genomic determinants of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are titin truncating mutations and lamin A/C mutations. Patients with these two genotypes show critically different phenotypes, including penetrance, coexistence with a conduction system abnormality, cardiac prognosis, and treatment response. The transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics of DCM include activation of the DNA damage response, metabolic reprogramming, and dedifferentiation. The proteomic and metabolomic signatures of the DCM heart include a rigorous dependency for free fatty acids, activation of the stress response, and metabolic reprogramming. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of blood show a distinct immune response and an unexpected link with pathology-specific microbiota in DCM. The direct integration of multi-omics data will not only elucidate inter-omics associations but also enable omics-based patient stratification, which will lead to a deeper understanding of cardiomyopathy and the development of precision medicine in cardiology.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This paper focuses on the significant role of government in promoting precision medicine and public health and the potential intersection with healthy living (HL) and population health. Recent research has highlighted the interplay between genes, environments and different exposures individuals and populations experience over a lifetime. These interactions between longitudinal behaviors, epigenetics, and expression of the human genome have the potential to transform health and well-being, even within a single generation. Precision medicine can elucidate these longitudinal interactions with a granularity that has not been previously possible across the exposome. Understanding the interactions between genes, epigenetics, proteins, metabolites, and the exposome may inform more evidence-based, effective policy, system, and environmental change to optimize individual and population health. Government has an important role in helping to fund primary research in precision medicine and precision public health, as well as creating and enforcing standards related to food systems, air quality, and access to health care, defining and optimizing measures of health care quality and safety, and ensuring data privacy standards and protections, interoperability, and integration with surveillance systems. Government partnership and collaboration with the non-profit and private sectors can optimize precision medicine and precision public health for the benefit of the United States and global population.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Physical inactivity is strongly associated with an unfavorable health profile, increasing an individual's risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Initiating a regular exercise routine contributes to improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, resting blood pressure, blood glucose, and circulating lipoproteins. However, the extent to which positive changes occur come with significant inter-individual variability within intervention groups; non-responders and responders have been commonly identified across populations, highlighting that not all exercise regimens are universally effective in all individuals and should therefore not be treated as a “one-size fits all” prescription. Recent studies have therefore emphasized reporting the quantity of participants favorably and meaningfully “responding” to varying amounts and intensities of exercise, thereby presenting the opportunity to view exercise prescription in the context of precision medicine. This review will address the impact of varying amounts and intensities of physical activity and exercise, highlighting their impact on key health metrics.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)With expanding knowledge in tumor biology and biomarkers, oncology therapies are increasingly moving away from the “one-size-fits-all’ rationale onto biomarker-driven therapies tailored according to patient-specific characteristics, most commonly the tumor’s molecular profile. The advent of precision medicine in oncology has been accompanied by the introduction of novel clinical trial designs that aim to identify biomarker-matched subgroups of patients that will benefit the most from targeted therapies. This innovation comes with the promise of answering more treatment questions, more efficiently and in less time. In this article, we give an overview of the different biomarker-based designs, comparing the features of enrichment, randomize-all, umbrella, and basket trials, and highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. We focus more on the novel designs known as master protocols, which include umbrella and basket trials. We have also conducted a search in ClinicalTrials.gov for registered oncology-related protocols of ongoing or completed trials labeled as umbrella or basket trials for solid tumors; we also included additional relevant trials retrieved from other reviews. We present and discuss the key features of the 30 eligible basket trials and 27 eligible umbrella trials. Only a minority of them are randomized (2 and 9, respectively), including three trials with adaptive randomization. Five of these trials have been completed as of July 2018. Precision medicine trial designs fuel new hopes for identifying best treatments, but there is also the potential for hype. The benefits and challenges associated with their use will need continued monitoring.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This paper reviews the value of incorporating psychosocial interventions into precision medicine for heart health. First, we review the empirical literature on prevalence of common mental health comorbidities among individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We then review transdiagnostic approaches for conceptualization and treatment of mental health in individuals with CVD. We highlight recent studies that have used novel methods to individualize psychosocial interventions. Finally, we propose a preliminary framework intended to support Health Care Providers in individualizing treatment, which includes: 1) assessment of patient risk factors, characteristics, and expectations; 2) consideration of transdiagnostic processes underlying several psychiatric symptoms that contribute to CVD risk; 3) patient engagement in shared decision-making for psychosocial treatment; and 4) ongoing outcome monitoring to evaluate treatment responsiveness. We anticipate that the proposed framework will evolve with the emergence of new empirical evidence; as such, future directions and challenges for research are discussed.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precision medicine is expected to impact the care of people with asthma, given its high disease prevalence, heterogeneity of pathophysiologic mechanisms, and consequent clinical phenotypes. A novel phenotype-stratified clinical trial conducted by the NHLBI AsthmaNet Consortium, titled Steroids in Eosinophil Negative Asthma (SIENA), was a randomized, multicenter, clinical trial that prospectively stratified individuals according to their baseline level of sputum inflammation during a screening period. Two phenotypic strata were assigned based on an a priori defined extent of sputum eosinophilia (Eos Low versus Eos High). This article describes: the scientific premise for the trial design, including assumptions used for power calculations; modifications to the analysis plan implemented after the trial started due to a higher than expected prevalence of one phenotypic stratum which impacted the ability to accrue sufficient subjects within the planned budget and study period; investigator alternatives to address the strata imbalance weighing scientific impact and study feasibility; and the final modified SIENA study design and analysis plan. SIENA was successfully completed in a manner that maintained meaningful outcomes. We conclude with recommendations for incorporation of pre-specified contingency plans into phenotype-directed protocols, to address the potential for differences in observed compared to estimated prevalence of different phenotypes in a study population. These approaches can be applied to precision medicine trials for the future.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precision Medicine is becoming the new paradigm in healthcare as it enables better resources allocation, treatment optimization with a potential side-effects reduction and consequent impact on quality of life and survival. This revolution is being catalyzed by liquid biopsy technologies, which provide prognostic and predictive information for advanced cancer patients, without the analytical and procedural drawbacks of tissue-biopsy. In particular, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is gaining momentum as a clinically feasible option capable to capture both spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity.(#br)Several techniques are currently available for ctDNA extraction and analysis, each with its preferential case scenarios and preanalytical implications which must be taken into consideration to effectively support clinical decision-making and to better highlight its clinical utility.(#br)Aim of this review is to summarize both analytical developments and clinical evidences to offer a comprehensive update on the deployment of ctDNA in breast cancer’s (BC) characterization and treatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Therapies targeting certain CFTR mutants have been approved, yet variations in clinical response highlight the need for in-vitro and genetic tools that predict patient-specific clinical outcomes. Toward this goal, the CF Canada-Sick Kids Program in Individual CF Therapy (CFIT) is generating a “first of its kind”, comprehensive resource containing patient-specific cell cultures and data from 100 CF individuals that will enable modeling of therapeutic responses.(#br)Methods(#br)The CFIT program is generating: 1) nasal cells from drug naïve patients suitable for culture and the study of drug responses in vitro , 2) matched gene expression data obtained by sequencing the RNA from the primary nasal tissue, 3) whole genome sequencing of blood derived DNA from each of the 100 participants, 4) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from each participant's blood sample, 5) CRISPR-edited isogenic control iPSC lines and 6) prospective clinical data from patients treated with CF modulators.(#br)Results(#br)To date, we have recruited 57 of 100 individuals to CFIT, most of whom are homozygous for F508del (to assess in-vitro: in-vivo correlations with respect to ORKAMBI response) or heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation. In addition, several donors are homozygous for rare nonsense and missense mutations. Nasal epithelial cell cultures and matched iPSC lines are available for many of these donors.(#br)Conclusions(#br)This accessible resource will enable development of tools that predict individual outcomes to current and emerging modulators targeting F508del-CFTR and facilitate therapy discovery for rare CF causing mutations.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Understanding and predicting inter-individual differences related to the success of drug therapy is of tremendous importance, both during drug development and for clinical applications. Importantly, while seminal twin studies indicate that the majority of inter-individual differences in drug disposition are driven by hereditary factors, common genetic polymorphisms explain only less than half of this genetically encoded variability. Recent progress in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has for the first time allowed to comprehensively map the genetic landscape of human pharmacogenes. Importantly, these projects have unveiled vast numbers of rare genetic variants, which are estimated to contribute substantially to the missing heritability of drug metabolism phenotypes. However, functional interpretation of these rare variants remains challenging and constitutes one of the important frontiers of contemporary pharmacogenomics. Furthermore, NGS technologies face challenges in the interrogation of genes residing in complex genomic regions, such as CYP2D6 and HLA genes. We here provide an update of the implementation of pharmacogenomic variations in the clinical setting and present emerging strategies that facilitate the translation of NGS data into clinically useful information. Importantly, we anticipate that these developments will soon result in a paradigm shift of pre-emptive genotyping away from the interrogation to candidate variants and towards the comprehensive profiling of an individuals genotype, thus allowing for a true individualization of patient drug treatment regimens.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background and purpose(#br)To find genetic markers associated with response to radiotherapy (RT) in glioblastoma (GB) patients.(#br)Materials and methods(#br)From Jan 2009 to Dec 2016, 161 patients with newly diagnosed IDH-wild type GB were treated with surgery and adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy with the Stupp’s regimen, and then genomic research proceeded with their surgical specimens. Among the 161 patients, 49 with clinically measurable disease on postoperative MRI were analyzed. The response evaluation to RT was based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. For genomic analyses to compare between patients with progression and non-progression, Fisher test for DNA mutations and copy number alterations and the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed.(#br)Results(#br)RT responses were non-progressive and progressive disease (PD) in 22 (44.9%) and 27 patients (55.1%), respectively. After three months, seven of PD exhibited pseudoprogression. For true response adjusting pseudoprogression from PD, 1-year progression-free survival for true Non-Responders (tNR-group) and true Responders (tR-group) were 0% and 45.4% (p < 0.001), and overall survival were 52.5% and 81.1% ( p = 0.046), respectively. In genomic analyses, the tNR-group had more CDKN2A deletions (94.4% vs. 55.6%, p = 0.013), EGFR mutations (33.3% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.012) and less TP53 mutations (22.2% vs. 40.7%, p = 0.333) than the tR-group. In GSEA, immune-related gene sets were enriched in the tNR-group, and in contrast, some gene sets related with cell cycle were enriched in tR-groups.(#br)Conclusion(#br)The RANO criteria were feasible for the short-term response evaluation from RT despite of pseudoprogression. Genomic differences such as CDKN2A deletion, EGFR mutation, and immune- or inflammation-related related gene sets enrichment were found to be potentially predictive markers of RT.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Neoplasms occurring in renal grafts represent a relatively novel and rare condition, whose treatment has not been standardized yet. Radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) of renal graft neoplasms is a nephron-sparing treatment, reported to be safe and effective. However, even in the RFA field, there is no procedural standardization. In this review of the literature, mostly composed by case reports and case series, we aim to assess efficacy and complication rates of RFA in the treatment of kidney graft neoplasms, and summarize the various procedural protocols found in the literature, using an easy-to-read point format. We performed a literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE with an overall description of 66 renal graft lesion treated with RFA, with a mean follow-up of 16.3 months (range 3–54.3). Technical success was achieved in all cases, with only one recurrence reported (1/66; 1.5%), occurring at 6-months follow-up. Complications occurred in 11 (11/66; 16.7%) patients. Based on literature review, RFA of renal graft neoplasms seems to be a feasible, safe, and effective treatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objective(#br)Non-progressive genetic disorders may present with motor dysfunction resembling cerebral palsy (CP). Such patients are often characterized as CP mimics. The purpose of this work was to delineate the clinical manifestations and molecular findings of CP mimic patients, with the ultimate goal to offer specific disease-modifying therapy and genetic counseling.(#br)Methods(#br)Retrospective study of 47 patients diagnosed with CP and no acquired etiology. Chart review of clinical, neuroradiological, biochemical and molecular data was performed.(#br)Results(#br)31,91% of patients manifested with features resembling dyskinetic CP, 19,14% spastic CP, 10,63% ataxic CP and 38,30% mixed CP. In 23 patients molecular diagnosis was reached and included 5 hereditary spastic paraplegia genes ( SPG ) in spastic CP mimics; HPRT1 , TH , QDPR , DDC in dystonic CP mimics; ADCY5 and NIKX2-1 in choreic CP mimics; CANA1A in ataxic CP mimics; and SPG , PDHA1 , NIKX2-1 , AT , SLC2A1 and SPR in mixed CP mimics. In 14 patients, the etiological diagnosis led to specific treatment.(#br)Conclusions(#br)CP mimics show a number of features that differ from classic CP and can be used as diagnostic clues, including presence of mixed motor features, minor dysmorphic features, oculogyric movements, multiple features of autonomic dysfunction, and acquired microcephaly. A more stringent use of the concept of CP focused on acquired lesions during the perinatal and infancy periods, and excluding disorders that could be of genetic origin, could contribute to a purer use of the term. Identification of a specific genetic cause for CP mimics may in certain cases lead to etiologic treatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[Recent research advancements indicate that atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease characterized by different subtypes/phenotypes based on age, disease chronicity, ethnicity, filaggrin and IgE status, and underlying molecular mechanisms/endotypes. This heterogeneity advocates against the traditional “one-size-fits-all” therapeutic approaches still used to manage AD. Precision medicine approaches, striving for targeted, tailored, endotype-driven disease prevention and treatment, rely on detailed definitions of the disease's variability across different phenotypes. Studies have shown that AD harbors different endotypes across different age groups and ethnicities and according to IgE levels and filaggrin mutation status. These include European American versus Asian patients, children versus adults, intrinsic versus extrinsic (IgE status) disease, and patients with and without filaggrin mutations. Therapies targeting different cytokine axes and other mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis, which are currently being tested for patients with AD across the disease spectrum, will expand our ability to dissect the relative contribution of each of these pathways to disease perpetuation.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Tuberculosis resistance diagnostics have vastly improved in recent years thanks to the development of standardised phenotypic and molecular testing methods. However, these methods are either slow or limited in the number of resistant genotypes they can detect. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) we can sidestep all those problems, as we can sequence whole tuberculosis genomes at increasingly smaller costs and requiring less and less DNA. In this review, we explain how accumulated knowledge in the field has allowed us to go from phenotypic testing to molecular methods to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for resistance diagnostics. We compare current diagnostic methods with WGS as to their efficacy in detecting resistant cases, and show how forthcoming advances in NGS technologies will be crucial in widespread implementation of WGS as a diagnostic tool.(#br)Resumen(#br)El diagnóstico de la tuberculosis resistente ha mejorado ampliamente en los últimos años gracias al desarrollo de pruebas estandarizadas de diagnóstico tanto fenotípicas como moleculares.

Con el auge de las nuevas tecnologías de secuenciación masiva podemos evitar esos problemas secuenciando el genoma completo cada vez a un coste más bajo y requiriendo cantidades menores de ADN. En esta revisión, explicamos cómo se ha podido progresar desde las pruebas fenotípicas a los métodos moleculares hasta la secuenciación del genoma completo para el diagnóstico de resistencias gracias a sucesivos descubrimientos en el campo. Comparamos la eficacia de la secuenciación del genoma completo para detectar casos resistentes con respecto a la de los métodos diagnósticos actuales, y mostramos cómo los avances futuros en esta tecnología serán cruciales para la implementación generalizada de esta herramienta diagnóstica.]]>

Considering evidence suggesting increased PGE 2 synthesis by BRAF mutation in tumour cells, we hypothesised that the association of tumour PTGS2 (COX-2) expression with colorectal cancer mortality might be stronger in BRAF -mutated tumours than in BRAF -wild-type tumours.(#br)Methods(#br)Using 1708 patients, including 1200 stage I-IV colorectal carcinoma cases in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and 508 stage III colon cancer cases in a National Cancer Institute–sponsored randomised controlled trial of adjuvant therapy ( CALGB /Alliance 89803), we evaluated tumour PTGS2 (COX-2) expression status using immunohistochemistry. We examined the prognostic association of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression in strata of BRAF mutation status by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to adjust for potential confounders, including disease stage, tumour differentiation, microsatellite instability status and KRAS and PIK3CA mutations.(#br)Results(#br)In NHS and HPFS, the association of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression with colorectal cancer-specific survival differed by BRAF mutation status ( P interaction = 0.0005); compared with PTGS2 (COX-2)-negative/low carcinomas, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for PTGS2 (COX-2)-high carcinomas were 2.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.28) in BRAF -mutated cases and 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.65–1.04) in BRAF -wild-type cases. Differential prognostic associations of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression in strata of BRAF mutation status were similarly observed in CALGB/Alliance 89803 trial ( P interaction = 0.03).(#br)Conclusions(#br)The association of tumour PTGS2 (COX-2) expression with colorectal cancer mortality is stronger in BRAF -mutated tumours than in BRAF -wild-type tumours, supporting interactive roles of PTGS2 (COX-2) expression and BRAF mutation statuses in prognostication of patients with colorectal cancer; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT00003835 .]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Previous decades have seen significant progress in the biological understanding of cardiovascular disease, as well as major advances in computational and information technologies. However, anticipated improvements in outcomes, quality, and cost of cardiovascular medicine at the individual and population levels from these advances have lagged expectations. Further, trends showing widening gaps in the pace of technological development and its successful uptake and application in practice suggests that substantial systemic changes are needed. Recent declines in key U.S. health outcomes have added further urgency to seek scalable approaches that deliver the right treatment to the right patient and to develop information-driven policies that improve health. The clinical care and research enterprises are currently in the midst of assimilating changes entrained by a “fourth industrial revolution” marked by the convergence of biology, physical sciences, and information science. These changes, if managed appropriately, can simultaneously enable cost-effective personalized medical care as well as more effective and targeted population health interventions. In this paper derived from a lecture in honor of cardiologist Paul Dudley White, the author explores how White’s prescient insights into prevention and treatment continue to resonate today as we seek to assimilate ubiquitous computing, sophisticated sensor technologies, and bidirectional digital communication into the practice of cardiology. How the ongoing acceleration in basic science and information technologies can be wedded to the principles articulated by White as we pursue scalable approaches to personalized medicine is also examined.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Progress in and better understanding of cancer biology causes a shift in cancer drug development: away from the evaluation of drugs in large tumour histology defined patient populations towards targeted agents in increasingly heterogeneous molecularly defined subpopulations. This requires novel approaches in clinical trial design by academia and industry, and development of new assessment tools by regulatory authorities.(#br)Pharmaceutical industry is developing new targeted agents generating many clinical studies, including target combinations. This requires improved operational efficiency by development of innovative trial designs, strategies for early-stage decision making and early selection of candidate drugs with a high likelihood of success. In addition, patient awareness and ethical considerations necessitate that agents will be rapidly available to patients.(#br)Regulatory Authorities such as the European Medicine Agency and national agencies recognise that these changes require a different attitude towards benefit-risk analysis for drug approval. The gold standard of randomised confirmatory Phase III trials is not always ethical or feasible when developing drugs for treatment of small cancer populations. Alternative strategies comprise accelerated approval via conditional marketing approval, which can be granted in the EU based on small non-randomised Phase II trials.(#br)The paper describes innovative trial designs with their pros and cons and efforts of pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities to deal with the paradigm shift. Furthermore, all stakeholders should continue to share their experiences and discuss problems in order to understand the position and concerns of the other stakeholders to learn from each other and to progress the field of novel oncology clinical trial design.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precision medicine is a rapidly-developing modality of medicine in human healthcare. Based on each patient׳s unique characteristics, more accurate dosages and drug selection can be made to achieve better therapeutic efficacy and less adverse reactions in precision medicine. A patient׳s individual parameters that affect drug transporter action can be used to develop a precision medicine guidance, due to the fact that therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions of drugs can both be affected by expression and function of drug transporters on the cell membrane surface. The purpose of this review is to summarize unique characteristics of human breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and the genetic variability in the BCRP encoded gene ABCG2 in the development of precision medicine. Inter-individual variability of BCRP/ ABCG2 can impact choices and outcomes of drug treatment for several diseases, including cancer chemotherapy. Several factors have been implicated in expression and function of BCRP, including genetic, epigenetic, physiologic, pathologic, and environmental factors. Understanding the roles of these factors in controlling expression and function of BCRP is critical for the development of precision medicine based on BCRP-mediated drug transport.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Introduction(#br)Prognostic tools typically combine several time-invariant clinical predictors using regression models that yield a single, time-invariant outcome prediction. This results in considerable information loss as repeatedly or continuously sampled data are aggregated into single summary measures. We describe a method for real-time multivariate outcome prediction that accommodates both longitudinal data and time-invariant clinical characteristics.(#br)Methods(#br)We included comatose patients treated after resuscitation from cardiac arrest who underwent ≥6 h of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. We used Persyst v13 (Persyst Development Corp, Prescott AZ) to generate quantitative EEG (qEEG) features and calculated hourly summaries of whole brain suppression ratio and amplitude-integrated EEG. We randomly selected half of subjects as a training sample and used the other half as a test sample. We applied group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to the training sample to group patients based on qEEG evolution, then estimated the relationship of group membership and clinical covariates with awakening from coma and surviving to hospital discharge using logistic regression. We used these parameters to calculate posterior probabilities of group membership (PPGMs) in the test sample, and built three prognostic models: adjusted logistic regression (no GBTM), unadjusted GBTM (no clinical covariates) and adjusted GBTM (all data). We compared these models performance characteristics.(#br)Results(#br)We included 723 patients. Group-specific outcome estimates from a 7-group GBTM ranged from 0 to 75%. Compared to unadjusted GBTM, adjusted GBTM calibration was significantly improved at 6 and 12 h, and time to an outcome estimate <10% and <5% were significantly shortened. Compared to simple logistic regression, adjusted GBTM identified a substantially larger proportion of subjects with outcome probability <1%.(#br)Conclusions(#br)We describe a novel methodology for combining GBTM output and clinical covariates to estimate patient-specific prognosis over time. Refinement of such methods should form the basis for new avenues of prognostication research that minimize loss of clinically important information.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Purpose(#br)This study was designed to assess the feasibility and safety of a single-step combined therapy using radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (RFA + TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and uncontrolled coagulopathy. The study also aimed to compare the effectiveness of this approach with TACE alone, performed in a control group.(#br)Material and methods(#br)One hundred and forty-three consecutive cirrhotic patients having a single HCC < 8 cm were enrolled in this observational prospective single-center study from January 2010 to June 2017 and were divided, according to coagulation tests, into three groups (A: low risk; B: intermediate risk and C: high risk of bleeding). The feasibility and safety of a single-step combined treatment (RFA followed by TACE) were evaluated in terms of technical success rate, periprocedural complications, and laboratory values variations. Tumor response obtained at 1-month CT follow-up for group C was compared with that of control group, composed by 16 matched patients with severe coagulopathy and single HCC < 8 cm, who underwent only TACE in a previous period, performed by the same operator.(#br)Results(#br)Technical success was achieved in all patients, without any major complications. Minor complications rate was significantly higher in group C after RFA; however, the patients were successfully treated with subsequent TACE therapy, without any differences between pre- and post-procedural laboratory values. One-month complete response rates were similar in all the three groups; however, the response rates of group C were significantly higher as compared to that of the control TACE Group (p < .001).(#br)Conclusion(#br)The single-step RFA plus TACE therapy allows expansion of the indication for percutaneous thermal ablation, allowing to also include cases previously contraindicated due to the procedural high-risk of complications associated with bleeding, thus improving short-term patient outcome.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Redox metabolism is often considered a potential target for cancer treatment, but a systematic examination of redox responses in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is missing.(#br)Methods(#br)Here, we employed systems biology and biological network analyses to reveal key roles of genes associated with redox metabolism in HCC by integrating multi-omics data.(#br)Findings(#br)We found that several redox genes, including 25 novel potential prognostic genes, are significantly co-expressed with liver-specific genes and genes associated with immunity and inflammation. Based on an integrative analysis, we found that HCC tumors display antagonistic behaviors in redox responses. The two HCC groups are associated with altered fatty acid, amino acid, drug and hormone metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, and NADPH-independent vs -dependent antioxidant defenses. Redox behavior varies with known tumor subtypes and progression, affecting patient survival. These antagonistic responses are also displayed at the protein and metabolite level and were validated in several independent cohorts. We finally showed the differential redox behavior using mice transcriptomics in HCC and noncancerous tissues and associated with hypoxic features of the two redox gene groups.(#br)Interpretation(#br)Our integrative approaches highlighted mechanistic differences among tumors and allowed the identification of a survival signature and several potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Depression is a complex mental health disorder, resulting in a high degree of disability. Since symptom constellation, course, and outcome are heterogeneous in these patients, current research initiatives are striving to establish stratified diagnostic and treatment approaches. In the past two decades, Dirk Hellhammer and his team introduced Neuropattern, a new diagnostic concept, which is based on conceptual endophenotypes of the stress response network. We explore how to use this concept in clinical practice in order to ultimately determine whether it brings any value over standard care. In view of the novelty of the concept and the difficulties dealing with such a concept at a practical level, it was necessary to initiate an exploratory study to determine key factors for planning future clinical trials.(#br)We report results and learning from an exploratory single-site study investigating the use and potential benefits of Neuropattern in standard care. Inpatients (ICD-10 diagnosis F32, F33; N = 178) were allocated to either treatment as usual (standard group, SG) or a novel Neuropattern oriented exploratory treatment (intervention group, IG). Symptom severity was assessed with psychometric tests at admission to hospital, during the first six weeks, and upon discharge from the hospital. In addition, direct and indirect costs were assessed for the 3-month-intervals prior to and after the hospital stay.(#br)Compared to the SG, depression scores of patients in the IG showed a faster decline once psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment were based on an individualized explanatory model. The patients in the IG with an F33 diagnosis showed a more pronounced reduction of depression severity during the stay in the hospital and a stronger and quicker reduction of general symptom severity. Comparing the average depression scores at the start of the study and after six weeks, a decline in symptoms was observed for all Neuropatterns.(#br)Some limitations of the study have to be mentioned: The study was not blinded, was single-site, included highly depressed inpatients only, and was conducted for no longer than 8 months. The results highlight some important points regarding taking the Neuropattern approach to the bedside and researching its efficacy and effectiveness to support personalized treatments in clinical care.]]>

          <![CDATA[Recent decades have seen dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information. In this article we detail the antagonistic philosophies behind two quantitative approaches: certifying robust effects in understandable variables, and evaluating how accurately a built model can forecast future outcomes. We discourage choosing analytical tools via categories such as ‘statistics’ or ‘machine learning’. Instead, to establish reproducible knowledge about the brain, we advocate prioritizing tools in view of the core motivation of each quantitative analysis: aiming towards mechanistic insight or optimizing predictive accuracy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Better risk-stratification of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and identification of subsets of ultra-high-risk (HR)-CLL patients are crucial in the contemporary era of an expanded therapeutic armamentarium for CLL.(#br)Methods(#br)A multivariate patient similarity network and clustering was applied to assess the prognostic values of routine genetic, laboratory, and clinical factors and to identify subsets of ultra-HR-CLL patients. The study cohort consisted of 116 HR-CLL patients (F/M 36/80, median age 63 yrs) carrying del(11q), del(17p)/ TP53 mutations and/or complex karyotype (CK) at the time of diagnosis.(#br)Results(#br)Three major subsets based on the presence of key prognostic variables as genetic aberrations, bulky lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and gender: profile (P)-I (n = 34, men/women with CK + no del(17p)/ TP53 mutations), P-II (n = 47, predominantly men with del(11q) + no CK + no del(17p)/ TP53 mutations), and P-III (n = 35, men/women with del(17p)/ TP53 mutations, with/without del(11q) and CK) were revealed. Subanalysis of major subsets identified three ultra-HR-CLL groups: men with TP53 disruption with/without CK, women with TP53 disruption with CK and men/women with CK + del(11q) with poor short-term outcomes (25% deaths/12 mo). Besides confirming the combinations of known risk-factors, the used patient similarity network added further refinement of subsets of HR-CLL patients who may profit from different targeted drugs.(#br)Conclusions(#br)This study showed for the first time in hemato-oncology the usefulness of the multivariate patient similarity networks for stratification of HR-CLL patients. This approach shows the potential for clinical implementation of precision medicine, which is especially important in view of an armamentarium of novel targeted drugs.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Blockade of the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) pathway is effective against solid tumors including lung cancer. PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor tissue serves as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of PD-1 pathway blockade. Here, we evaluated the expression of PD-L1 on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with lung cancer.(#br)Materials and Methods(#br)Peripheral whole blood (3 mL) was collected from patients and CTCs and PD-L1 expression were detected using a microcavity array (MCA) system. Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 detection was also performed using matched tumor tissues.(#br)Results(#br)Sixty-seven patients with lung cancer were enrolled in the study between July 2015 and April 2016 at Wakayama Medical University. The characteristics of the patients were as follows: median age 71 years (range, 39–86); male 72%; stage II–III/IV, 14/85%; non-small cell lung cancer/small cell lung cancer/other, 73/21/6%. CTCs were detected in 66 of 67 patients (median, 19; range, 0–115) and more than five CTCs were detected in 78% of patients. PD-L1-expressing CTCs were detected in 73% of patients and the proportion score of PD-L1-expressing CTCs ranged from 3 to 100%, suggesting intra-patient heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression on CTCs. Tumor tissues were available from 27 patients and were immunostained for PD-L1 and no correlation was observed between tumor tissues and CTCs based on the proportion score ( R 2 = 0.0103).(#br)Conclusion(#br)PD-L1 expression was detectable on CTCs in patients with lung cancer and intra-patient heterogeneity was observed. No correlation was observed between PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues and CTCs.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Medical coatings cooperated with biomacromolecules can regulate biological events and tissue responses, thus increasing medical implant longevity and providing improved and/or new therapeutic functions. In particular, medical coatings, which can load the correct species and doses of biomacromolecules according to individual diagnoses, will significantly optimize treatment effects and satisfy the rising clinical need of “precision medicine”. Herein, we report on a dynamic microporous coating with an ultrafast self-healing property to fulfill the “load-and-play” concept for “precision medicine”. A structure-switchable coating based on poly(ε-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) triblock copolymer network is constructed. The coating can be switched to microporous morphology via a water swelling and freeze-drying process. Then, through a mild thermo-trigger as low as 40 °C, this spongy coating can undergo self-healing to switch back to a pore-free structure within minutes to even 5 s. Based on this dynamic coating, we suggest a simple and versatile method to encapsulate biomacromolecules for surface-mediated delivery. The ultrafast self-healing of the microporous structure enables uniform incorporation of biomacromolecules with an easily achieved high loading of albumin of 16.3 μg/cm 2 within 1 min. More importantly, controllable encapsulation can be realized by simple control of the concentration of the loading solution. We further demonstrate that the encapsulated biomacromolecules retained their bioactivity. This work may benefit clinicians with flexibility to provide personalized medical coatings for individual patients during treatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a representative autoimmune disease characterized by multiple organ manifestations but is molecularly and genetically heterogeneous which makes difficult to manage every case based on one kinetic molecular theory. We, therefore, have tried to obtain a broader perspective on the molecular heterogeneity in SLE by immunophenotyping and found that patients with active SLE can be divided into 3 subgroups based on T cell heterogeneity. Although immunophenotypic features were different even among patients with similar clinical features, patients resistant to treatment were most frequently seen in the follicular helper T cell-dominant group. Because belimumab is only approved targeted therapy for SLE, the concept was encompassed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) for which multiple biologics are approved. The obtained results suggest the potential for precision medicine via the strategic selection of different biologics based on the phenotypic differences in peripheral helper T cells in individual patients with PsA. Thus, subgrouping heterogeneous diseases could provide good bases for precision medicine, which would encourage treatment strategies of diseases with high clinical and molecular heterogeneity such as SLE.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objective(#br)We tested whether acute cerebellar stroke may determine changes in brain network architecture as defined by cortical sources of EEG rhythms.(#br)Methods(#br)Graph parameters of 41 consecutive stroke patients (<5 days from the event) were studied using eLORETA EEG sources. Network rearrangements of stroke patients were investigated in delta, alpha 2, beta 2 and gamma bands in comparison with healthy subjects.(#br)Results(#br)The delta network remodeling was similar in cerebellar and middle cerebral artery strokes, with a reduction of small-worldness . Beta 2 and gamma small-worldness , in the right hemisphere of patients with cerebellar stroke, increase respect to healthy subjects, while alpha 2 small-worldness increases only among patients with a middle cerebral artery stroke.(#br)Conclusions(#br)The network remodeling characteristics are independent on the size of the ischemic lesion. In the early post-acute stages cerebellar stroke differs from the middle cerebral artery one because it does not cause alpha 2 network remodeling while it determines a high frequency network reorganization in beta 2 and gamma bands with an increase of small-worldness characteristics.(#br)Significance(#br)These findings demonstrate changes in the balance of local segregation and global integration induced by cerebellar acute stroke in high EEG frequency bands. They need to be integrated with appropriate follow-up to explore whether further network changes are attained during post-stroke outcome stabilization.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precision medicine has spurred new innovations in molecular pathology leading to recent advances in the analysis of exhaled breath as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in exhaled breath have the potential to reveal a wealth of chemical and metabolomic information. This study describes the development of a method for the analysis of breath, based on automated thermal desorption (TD) combined with flow modulated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) with dual flame ionisation and quadrupole mass spectrometric detection (FID and qMS). The constrained optimisation and analytical protocol was designed to meet the practical demands of a large-scale multi-site clinical study, while maintaining analytical rigour to produce high fidelity data. The results demonstrate a comprehensive method optimisation for the collection and analysis of breath VOCs by GC×GC, integral to the standardisation and integration of breath analysis within large clinical studies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This work evaluates the possibility of placement of high-resolution imaging and single-cell analysis via laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) within precision medicine by assessing the suitability of LA-ICP-MS as a micro-analytical technique for the localization and quantification of membranous receptors in heterogeneous cell samples that express both the membrane-bound receptors C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Staining of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 X4 and MDA-MB-468 was achieved using receptor-specific hybrid tracers, containing both a fluorophore and a DTPA single-lanthanide chelate. Prior to LA-ICP-MS imaging, fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) imaging was performed to localize the receptors, hereby enabling direct comparison. Based on the different expression levels of CXCR4 and EGFR, a distinction could be made between the cell lines using both imaging modalities. Furthermore, FCM and LA-ICP-MS demonstrated complementary characteristics, as a more distinct discrimination could be made between both cell lines based on the EGFR-targeting hybrid tracer via LA-ICP-MS, due to the intrinsic CXCR4-related green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal present in the MDA-MB-231 X4 cells. Employing state-of-the-art LA-ICP-MS instrumentation in bidirectional area scanning mode for sub-cellular imaging of MDA-MB-231 X4 cells enabled the specific binding of the CXCR4-targeting hybrid tracer to the cell membrane to be clearly demonstrated. The stretching of cells over the glass substrate led to a considerably higher signal response for pixels at the cell edges, relative to the more central pixels. The determination of the expression levels of CXCR4 and EGFR for the MDA-MB-468 cell line was performed using LA-ICP-MS single-cell analysis (sc-LA-ICP-MS) and external calibration, based on the quantitative ablation of Ho-spiked dried gelatin droplet standards. Additionally, a second calibration approach was applied based on spot ablation of highly homogeneous dried gelatin gels in combination with the determination of the ablated volume using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and yielded results which were in good agreement with the expression levels determined via flow cytometry (FC) and mass cytometry (MC). Hybrid tracers enable a direct comparison between (i) FCM and LA-ICP-MS imaging for the evaluation of the microscopic binding pattern and between (ii) FC, MC and sc-LA-ICP-MS for the quantification of receptor expression levels in single cells.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Background & Aims(#br)Oxidative stress is regarded a key component of critical illness and has been associated with poor prognosis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Diverse antioxidant treatments have been applied to combat oxidative stress in ICU, yet the results were typically disappointing. An explanation for this failure is that all studies utilized antioxidants indiscriminately and did not take into account the antioxidant profile of the patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether critically ill patients experience different insufficiencies in three major antioxidants with a “recycling” redox relationship (vitamin C, vitamin E and glutathione) and in the central reductant molecule of many enzymatic antioxidants (NADPH).(#br)Methods(#br)Sixty mechanically-ventilated adult medical critically ill patients (age: 63.5±17.1; APACHE II score: 21.2±7.4; Glasgow Coma Scale: 6.2±1.9) were enrolled in the study, while 20 healthy age-matched volunteers served as control group. The antioxidant profile and the level of systemic oxidative stress (F 2 -isoprostanes) were measured at ICU admission and at days 1 and 7.(#br)Results(#br)The majority of the ICU patients developed rapid and severe antioxidant insufficiencies (by exhibiting less than 50% of the control values) in one (22/60), two (7/60) or three (2/60) of the antioxidants measured, despite the almost similar levels of oxidative stress.(#br)Conclusions(#br)The wide heterogeneity in antioxidant decreases in response to ICU stay highlights the importance of patient stratification when planning to apply antioxidant treatments and indicates that the successful delivery of personalized clinical nutrition may depend on our ability to identify “responsive” phenotypes.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background & Aims(#br)Adult patients suffering from liver disease of unknown cause represent an understudied and underserved population. The use of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the assessment of a broader spectrum of non-oncological diseases, among adults, remains poorly studied. We assessed the utility of WES in the diagnosis and management of adults with unexplained liver disease despite comprehensive evaluation by a hepatologist and with no history of alcohol overuse.(#br)Methods(#br)We performed WES and deep phenotyping of 19 unrelated adult patients with idiopathic liver disease recruited at a tertiary academic health care center in the US.(#br)Results(#br)Analysis of the exome in 19 cases identified 4 monogenic disorders in 5 unrelated adults. Patient 1 suffered for 18 years from devastating complications of undiagnosed type 3 familial partial lipodystrophy due to a deleterious heterozygous variant in PPARG . Molecular diagnosis enabled initiation of leptin replacement therapy with subsequent normalization of liver aminotransferases, amelioration of dyslipidemia, and decreases in daily insulin requirements. Patients 2 and 3 were diagnosed with MDR3 deficiency due to recessive mutations in ABCB4 . Patient 4 with a prior diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was found to harbor a mitochondrial disorder due to a homozygous pathogenic variant in NDUFB3 ; this finding enabled initiation of disease preventive measures including supplementation with antioxidants. Patient 5 is a lean patient with hepatic steatosis of unknown etiology who was found to have a damaging heterozygous variant in APOB .(#br)Conclusions(#br)Genomic analysis yielded an actionable diagnosis in a substantial number (∼25%) of selected adult patients with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. This study supports the use of WES in the evaluation and management of adults with idiopathic liver disease in clinical practice.(#br)Lay summary(#br)We performed whole-exome sequencing in 19 adult patients with unexplained liver disease after an unrevealing conventional work-up performed by a hepatologist. In 5 cases, genomic analysis led to a diagnosis and informed treatment and management of the disease. Therefore, we suggest using whole-exome sequencing in the evaluation and management of adults with unexplained liver disease.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a deadly cancer of the biliary epithelium with limited therapeutic options. It is a heterogeneous group of cancer that could develop at any level from the biliary tree and is currently classified into intrahepatic, perihilar and distal based on its anatomical location. With incidence and mortality rates currently increasing, it is now the second most common type of primary liver cancer and represents up to 3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. High-throughput genomics and epigenomics have greatly increased our understanding of CCA underlying biology, however its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. CCA is characterized by a highly desmoplastic microenvironment containing stromal cells, mainly cancer-associated fibroblasts, infiltrating tumor epithelium. Tumor microenvironment in CCA is a highly dynamic environment that, besides stromal and endothelial cells, encompass also an abundance of immune cells, of both the innate and adaptive immune system (including tumor-associated macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T and B lymphocytes) and abundant proliferative factors. It is orchestrated by multiple soluble factors and signals, that eventually define a tumor growth-permissive microenvironment. Through complicate interactions with CCA cells, tumor microenvironment profoundly affects the proliferative and invasive abilities of epithelial cancer cells and plays an important role in accelerating neovascularization and preventing apoptosis of neoplastic cells. In this review, we discuss recent developments regarding the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, the role of each cellular population, and their multiarticulate interaction with the malignant population. Further we discuss innovative treatment approaches, including immunotherapy, and how identification of CCA secreted factors by both the stromal component and immune cell subsets are leading towards a precision medicine in CCA.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disorder characterized by prolonged periods of fatigue, chronic pain, depression, and a complex constellation of other symptoms. Currently, ME/CFS has no known cause, nor are the mechanisms of illness well understood. Therefore, with few exceptions, attempts to treat ME/CFS have been directed mainly toward symptom management. These treatments include antivirals, pain relievers, antidepressants, and oncologic agents as well as other single-intervention treatments. Results of these trials have been largely inconclusive and, in some cases, contradictory. Contributing factors include a lack of well-designed and -executed studies and the highly heterogeneous nature of ME/CFS, which has made a single etiology difficult to define. Because the majority of single-intervention treatments have shown little efficacy, it may instead be beneficial to explore broader-acting combination therapies in which a more focused precision-medicine approach is supported by a systems-level analysis of endocrine and immune co-regulation.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive subgroup of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with high grade and high risk of metastasis. However, there are no systemic therapies available that target SS. Therefore, transformative therapy is needed for SS. To establish a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model, a patient tumor with high grade SS from a lower extremity was grown orthotopically in the right biceps femoris muscle of mice. To test the efficacy of drugs, the PDOX models were randomized into five groups: Group 1 (G1), control-without treatment; Group 2 (G2), doxorubicin (DOX); Group 3 (G3), temozolomide (TEM); Group 4 (G4), gemcitabine (GEM) combined with docetaxel (DOC); and Group 5 (G5), pazopanib (PAZ). Tumor size and body weight were measured twice a week for each treatment group. A significant growth inhibition was found on day 14 in each treatment group compared to the untreated control, except for DOX. However, PAZ was significantly more effective than both TEM and GEM + DOC. In addition, PAZ significantly regressed the tumor volume on day 14 compared to day 0. No change was found in body weight on day 14 compared to day 0 in any treatment group. The present study demonstrated the precision of the SS PDOX models for individualizing SS therapy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background/Objectives(#br)A breakthrough in chemotherapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may be achieved using precision medicine, which involves identifying cases that are highly likely to respond to a certain treatment and then performing that treatment. BRCAness has been receiving attention as a novel predictor of anticancer drug sensitivity in PDAC, making the screening of BRCAness paramount.(#br)Methods(#br)We conducted the first-ever examination of the feasibility of analyzing BRCAness using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples obtained via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) from 20 patients with the highest pancreatic carcinoma cell counts in tissue samples out of 40 consecutive PDAC patients who underwent EUS-FNAB at our hospital were analyzed by MLPA for BRCAness.(#br)Results(#br)We were able to accurately analyze BRCAness in 75% of the 20 cases of PDAC using FFPE tissue obtained by EUS-FNAB. BRCAness was observed in one of the 20 cases.(#br)Conclusions(#br)In PDAC, analyzing BRCAness by MLPA using FFPE tissue obtained by EUS-FNAB offers the remarkable benefit of yielding results in a short period of time and at a low cost. In addition, this method of BRCAness analysis may prove to be a feasible and effective approach for performing precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Organoid technology has been remarkably improved over the last decade. Various organoids have been derived from different types of tissues and recapitulate their organ-specific gene expression signatures, particular tissue spatial structures and functions of their original tissue. The patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been used to elucidate crucial scientific questions, including the relationships between genetic/epigenetic alterations and drug responses, cell plasticity during disease progressions, and mechanisms of drug resistances. With the great expectations, PDOs will be widely used to facilitate the personalized medical decisions, which have the potential to profoundly improve patient outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the developmental details, current achievements, applications and challenges of organoid technology in precision cancer medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of pediatric hospital admission. Empiric antibiotic therapy for hospitalized children with serious CAP now targets the most likely pathogen(s), including those that may demonstrate significant antibiotic resistance. Cell-free plasma next-generation sequencing (CFPNGS) was first made available for Pediatric Infectious Diseases physicians in June 1, 2017, to supplement standard-of-care diagnostic techniques. A retrospective chart review was performed for children hospitalized with CAP between June 1, 2017, and January 22, 2018, to evaluate the impact of CFPNGS. We identified 15 hospitalized children with CAP without other underlying medical conditions for whom CFPNGS was performed. CFPNGS identified a pathogen in 13 of 15 (86%) children compared with 47% for those using standard culture and PCR-based methods alone. Changes in antibiotic management were made in 7 of 15 (47%) of children as a result of CFPNGS.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Intracellular Doppler spectroscopy is a form of low-coherence digital holography based upon Doppler detection of scattered light that measures drug response/resistance in tumor spheroids, xenografts, and clinical biopsies. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the main causes of ineffective cancer treatment. One MDR mechanism is mediated by the MDR1 gene that encodes the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Overexpression of Pgp in some cancers is associated with poor chemotherapeutic response. This paper uses intracellular Doppler spectroscopy to detect Pgp-mediated changes to drug response in 3D tissues grown from an ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV3). The SKOV3 cell line was incrementally exposed to cisplatin to create a cell line with increased Pgp expression (SKOV3cis). Subsequently, MDR1 in a subset of these cells was silenced in SKOV3cis using shRNA to create a doxycycline inducible, Pgp-silenced cell line (SKOV3 cis -sh). A specific Pgp inhibitor, zosuquidar, was used to study the effects of Pgp inhibition on the Doppler spectra. Increased drug sensitivity was observed with Pgp silencing or inhibition as determined by drug IC50s of paclitaxel-response of silenced Pgp and doxorubicin-response of inhibited Pgp, respectively. These results indicate that intracellular Doppler spectroscopy can detect changes in drug response due to silencing or inhibition of a single protein associated with drug resistance with important consequences for personalized medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Precision medicine strategies for treating rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a childhood malignancy, have not been developed. We examined the effect of CH5126766, a potent selective dual RAF/MEK inhibitor, on RMS cell lines. Among the eleven cell lines studied, one NRAS and two HRAS mutated cell lines were detected. CH5126766 inhibited the proliferation and growth in all of the RAS-mutated RMS cell lines, while it induced G1 cell cycle arrest in two of them. G1 cell cycle arrest was accompanied by p21 up-regulation and RB dephosphorylation. CH5126766 also suppressed the in vivo growth of RAS-mutated RMS tumor, and the mice showed improved survival. Thus, our results demonstrate that CH5126766 is an effective RAF/MEK inhibitor in RAS-mutated RMS. This study not only shows that in RMS, mutations in the RAS pathway can be a target for precision medicine, but also demonstrates that the evaluation of the gene mutation status is important in childhood malignancies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Prostate cancer is screened by testing circulating levels of the prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) biomarker, monitoring changes over time, or a digital rectal exam. Abnormal results often lead to prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer positive patients are stratified into very low‐risk, low‐risk, intermediate‐risk, and high‐risk, based on clinical classification parameters, to assess therapy options. However, there remains a gap in our knowledge and a compelling need for improved risk stratification to inform clinical decisions and reduce both over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. Further, current strategies for clinical intervention do not distinguish clinically aggressive prostate cancer from indolent disease. This mini‐review takes advantage of a large number of functionally characterized microRNAs (miRNA), epigenetic regulators of prostate cancer, that define prostate cancer cell activity, tumor stage, and circulate as biomarkers to monitor disease progression. Nanoparticles provide an effective platform for targeted delivery of miRNA inhibitors or mimics specifically to prostate tumor cells to inhibit cancer progression. Several prostate–specific transmembrane proteins expressed at elevated levels in prostate tumors are under investigation for targeting therapeutic agents to prostate cancer cells. Given that prostate cancer progresses slowly, circulating miRNAs can be monitored to identify tumor progression in indolent disease, allowing identification of miRNAs for nanoparticle intervention before the crucial point of transition to aggressive disease. Here, we describe clinically significant and non‐invasive intervention nanoparticle strategies being used in clinical trials for drug and nucleic acid delivery. The advantages of mesoporous silica‐based nanoparticles and a number of candidate miRNAs for inhibition of prostate cancer are discussed.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)The majority of studies comparing active psychological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not find significant differences at posttreatment. This was the case in a recent trial examining prolonged exposure (PE) and virtual reality exposure (VRE) among active‐duty soldiers with combat‐related PTSD. Matching individual patients to specific treatments provides a potential avenue to improve significantly the public health impact of effective treatments for PTSD. A composite moderator approach was used to identify profiles of patients who would see superior PTSD symptom reduction in VRE or PE to inform future treatment matching.(#br)Methods(#br)Active duty U.S. army soldiers ( N = 108) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing VRE and PE in the treatment of PTSD stemming from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. Eighteen baseline variables were examined to identify treatment response heterogeneity in two patient groups: those with a superior response to PE and those with a superior response to VRE. The final composite moderator comprised four of 18 baseline variables.(#br)Results(#br)Results revealed that patients who were predicted to see greater PTSD symptom reduction in VRE were likely to be younger, not taking antidepressant medication, had greater PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, and were more likely to have greater than minimal suicide risk.(#br)Conclusions(#br)Results suggest that treatment matching based on patient profiles could meaningfully improve treatment efficacy for combat‐related PTSD. Future research can build on these results to improve our understanding of how to improve treatment matching for PTSD.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Retrospectively measuring markers on stored baseline samples from participants in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) may provide high quality evidence as to the value of the markers for treatment selection. Originally developed for approximating gene‐environment interactions in the odds ratio scale, the case‐only method has recently been advocated for assessing gene‐treatment interactions on rare disease endpoints in randomized clinical trials. In this article, the case‐only approach is shown to provide a consistent and efficient estimator of marker by treatment interactions and marker‐specific treatment effects on the relative risk scale. The prohibitive rare‐disease assumption is no longer needed, broadening the utility of the case‐only approach. The case‐only method is resource‐efficient as markers only need to be measured in cases only. It eliminates the need to model the marker's main effect, and can be used with any parametric or nonparametric learning method. The utility of this approach is illustrated by an application to genetic data in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trial.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Immunotherapy is revolutionizing cancer treatment and has shown success in particular for tumors with a high mutational load. These effects have been linked to neoantigens derived from patient‐specific mutations. To expand efficacious immunotherapy approaches to the vast majority of tumor types and patient populations carrying only a few mutations and maybe not a single presented neoepitope, it is necessary to expand the target space to non‐mutated cancer‐associated antigens. Mass spectrometry enables the direct and unbiased discovery and selection of tumor‐specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptides that can be used to define targets for immunotherapy. Combining these targets into a warehouse allows for multi‐target therapy and accelerated clinical application. For precise personalization aimed at optimally ensuring treatment efficacy and safety, it is necessary to assess the presence of the target on each individual patient's tumor. Here we show how LC‐MS paired with gene expression data was used to define mRNA biomarkers currently being used as diagnostic test IMADETECT™ for patient inclusion and personalized target selection within two clinical trials (NCT02876510, NCT03247309). Thus, we present a way how to translate HLA peptide presentation into gene expression thresholds for companion diagnostics in immunotherapy considering the peptide‐specific correlation to its encoding mRNA.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Undifferentiated spindle‐cell sarcoma (USCS) is a recalcitrant cancer, resistant to conventional chemotherapy. A patient with high‐grade USCS from a striated muscle was implanted orthotopically in the right biceps femoris muscle of mice to establish a patient‐derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model. The PDOX models were randomized into the following groups when tumor volume reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup>: G1, control without treatment; G2, doxorubicin (DOX) (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.] injection, weekly, for 2 weeks); G3, temozolomide (TEM) (25 mg/kg, p.o., daily, for 14 days). Tumor size and body weight were measured with calipers and a digital balance twice a week. TEM significantly inhibited tumor volume growth compared to the untreated control and the DOX‐treated group on day 14 after treatment initiation: control (G1): 343 ± 78 mm<sup>3</sup>; DOX (G2): 308 ± 31 mm<sup>3</sup>, P = 0.272; TEM (G3): 85 ± 21 mm<sup>3</sup>, P < 0.0001. TEM significantly regressed the tumor volume compared to day 0 ( P = 0.019). There were no animal deaths in any group. The body weight of treated mice was not significantly different in any group. Tumors treated with DOX were comprised of spindle‐shaped viable cells without apparent necrosis or inflammatory changes. In contrast, tumors treated with TEM showed extensive tumor necrosis. The present study demonstrates the potential power of matching the patient with an effective drug and saving the patient needless toxicity from ineffective drugs.]]>

          <![CDATA[Assessing heterogeneous treatment effects is a growing interest in advancing precision medicine. Individualized treatment effects (ITEs) play a critical role in such an endeavor. Concerning experimental data collected from randomized trials, we put forward a method, termed random forests of interaction trees (RFIT), for estimating ITE on the basis of interaction trees. To this end, we propose a smooth sigmoid surrogate method, as an alternative to greedy search, to speed up tree construction. The RFIT outperforms the “separate regression” approach in estimating ITE. Furthermore, standard errors for the estimated ITE via RFIT are obtained with the infinitesimal jackknife method. We assess and illustrate the use of RFIT via both simulation and the analysis of data from an acupuncture headache trial.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Germline and tumor pharmacogenomics impact drug responses, but germline markers less commonly guide oncology prescribing. The authors hypothesized that a critical number of clinically actionable germline pharmacogenomic associations exist, representing clinical implementation opportunities.(#br)METHODS(#br)In total, 125 oncology drugs were analyzed for positive germline pharmacogenomic associations in journals with impact factors ≥5. Studies were assessed for design and genotyping quality, clinically relevant outcomes, statistical rigor, and evidence of drug‐gene effects. Associations from studies of high methodologic quality were deemed potentially clinically actionable, and translational summaries were written as point‐of‐care clinical decision support (CDS) tools and formally evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.(#br)RESULTS(#br)The authors identified germline pharmacogenomic results for 56 of 125 oncology drugs (45%) across 173 publications. Actionable associations were detected for 12 drugs, including 6 that had germline pharmacogenomic information within US Food and Drug Administration labels or published guidelines (capecitabine/fluorouracil/dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [ DPYD ], irinotecan/uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 [ UGT1A1 ], mercaptopurine/thioguanine/thiopurine S‐methyltransferase [ TPMT ], tamoxifen/cytochrome P450 [CYP] family 2 subfamily D member 6 [ CYP2D6 ]), and 6 others were novel (asparaginase/nuclear factor of activated T‐cells 2 [ NFATC2 ]/human leukocyte antigen D‐related β1 [ HLA ‐ DRB1 ], cisplatin/acylphosphatase 2 [ ACYP2 ], doxorubicin/adenosine triphosphate‐binding cassette subfamily C member 2/Rac family small guanosine triphosphatase 2/neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 [ ABCC2/RAC2/NCF4 ], lapatinib/human leukocyte antigen DQ α1 [ HLA‐DQA1 ], sunitinib/cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 5 [ CYP3A5 ], vincristine / centrosomal protein 72 [ CEP72 ]). By using AGREE II, the developed CDS summaries had high mean ± standard deviation scores (maximum score, 100) for scope and purpose (92.7 ± 5.1) and rigour of development (87.6 ± 7.4) and moderate yet robust scores for clarity of presentation (58.6 ± 25.1) and applicability (55.9 ± 24.6). The overall mean guideline quality score was 5.2 ± 1.0 (maximum score, 7). Germline pharmacogenomic CDS summaries for these 12 drugs were recommended for implementation.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)Several oncology drugs have actionable germline pharmacogenomic information, justifying their delivery through institutional pharmacogenomic implementations to determine clinical utility.

We analysed the relationship of PG x levels with insurance coverage.(#br)Results(#br)A total of 243 labels were listed by Pharm GKB , and 215 (88%) had PG x levels for US labels and 52 (21%) for Japanese labels. Of the 215 US labels, 54 were designated as “Testing Required” in PG x levels. PG x levels in US labels were strongly associated with coverage of PGBM testing. Tests in 52 (96%) of the 54 labels with Testing Required had insurance coverage, 2 (50%) of 4 in “Testing Recommended,” 38 (38%) of 100 in “Actionable PG x,” 11 (19%) of 57 in “Informative PG x” and 3 (11%) of 28 in “No Level.” In Japanese labels, only 14 of 52 were listed as Testing Required, and all were covered by the National Health Insurance in Japan.(#br)What is new and conclusion(#br)The PG x level given in drug labels provides information on availability of PGBM testing. Higher PG x levels, based on better evidence of usefulness of PGBM testing, provide a route to broader test coverage.]]>

          <![CDATA[Aim(#br)The SONAR trial uses an enrichment design based on the individual response to the selective endothelin receptor antagonist atrasentan on efficacy (the degree of the individual response in the urinary albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio [UACR]) and safety/tolerability (signs of sodium retention and acute increases in serum creatinine) to assess the effects of this agent on major renal outcomes. The patient population and enrichment results are described here.(#br)Methods(#br)Patients with type 2 diabetes with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and UACR between 300 and 5000 mg/g were enrolled. After a run‐in period, eligible patients received 0.75 mg/d of atrasentan for 6 weeks. A total of 2648 responder patients in whom UACR decreased by ≥30% compared to baseline were enrolled, as were 1020 non‐responders with a UACR decrease of <30%. Patients who experienced a weight gain of >3 kg and in whom brain natriuretic peptide exceeded ≥300 pg/mL, or who experienced an increase in serum creatinine >20% (0.5 mg/dL), were not randomized.(#br)Results(#br)Baseline characteristics were similar for atrasentan responders and non‐responders. Upon entry to the study, median UACR was 802 mg/g in responders and 920 mg/g in non‐responders. After 6 weeks of treatment with atrasentan, the UACR change in responders was −48.8% (95% CI, −49.8% to −47.9%) and in non‐responders was −1.2% (95% CI, −6.4% to 3.9%). Changes in other renal risk markers were similar between responders and non‐responders except for a marginally greater reduction in systolic blood pressure and eGFR in responders.(#br)Conclusions(#br)The enrichment period has successfully identified a population with a profound UACR reduction without clinical signs of sodium retention in whom a large atrasentan effect on clinically important renal outcomes is possible. The SONAR trial aims to establish whether atrasentan confers renal protection.]]>

          <![CDATA[Predictive biomarkers (PBioMs) are objective biological measures that predict response to medical treatments for diseases. The current study translates methods used in the field of precision medicine to identify PBioMs to identify parallel predictive behavioral markers (PBMs), defined as objective behavioral measures that predict response to treatment. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by examining the accuracy of two PBMs for automatically reinforced self‐injurious behavior (ASIB). Results of the analysis indicated both functioned as good to excellent PBMs. We discuss the compatibility of this approach with applied behavior analysis, describe methods to identify additional PBMs, and posit that variables related to the mechanisms of problem behavior and putative mechanism of treatment action hold the most promise as potential PBMs. We discuss how this technology could guide individualized treatment selection, inform our understanding of problem behavior and mechanisms of treatment action, and help determine the conditional effectiveness of clinical procedures.]]>

          <![CDATA[The notion that genetics, through natural selection, determines innate traits has led to much debate and divergence of thought on the impact of innate traits on the human phenotype. The purpose of this synthesis was to examine how innate theory informs genetic research and how understanding innate theory through the lens of Martha Rogers’ theory of unitary human beings can offer a contemporary view of how innate traits can inform epigenetic and genetic research. We also propose a new conceptual model for genetic and epigenetic research. The philosophical, theoretical, and research literatures were examined for this synthesis. We have merged philosophical and conceptual phenomena from innate theory with the theory of unitary beings into the University of Illinois at Chicago model for genetic and epigenetic research. Innate traits are the cornerstone of the framework but may be modified epigenetically by biological, physiological, psychological, and social determinants as they are transcribed. These modifiers serve as important links between the concept of innate traits and epigenetic modifications, and, like the theory of unitary human beings, the process is understood in the context of individual and environmental interaction that has the potential to evolve as the determinants change.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)The 100 000 Genome Project aims to develop a diagnostics platform by introducing whole genome sequencing (WGS) into clinical practice. Samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were subjected to WGS. WGS detection of single nucleotide variants and insertion/deletions were validated by targeted next generation sequencing showing high concordance (96·3%), also for detection of sub‐clonal variants and low‐frequency TP53 variants. Copy number alteration detection was verified by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and genome‐wide single nucleotide polymorphism array (concordances of 86·7% and 92·9%, respectively), confirming adequate sensitivity by WGS. Our results confirm that WGS can provide comprehensive genomic characterisation for clinical trials, drug discovery and, ultimately, precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal effusion specimens present diagnostic challenges and clinical opportunities for cytology. For the patient, these specimens may be the first diagnosis of malignancy or the first sign of disease recurrence. This review aims to provide useful approaches with which to resolve key difficulties in cytologic diagnosis through the use of ancillary studies, focusing on immunohistochemistry. These approaches are suggested in concert with clinical, radiographic, and morphologic findings. The differentiation of reactive mesothelial cells from malignant mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma is a recurring theme, and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)/AE1/AE3, claudin 4, and BRCA1‐associated protein 1 (BAP1) immunostains are useful new tools in the armamentarium. A targeted workup is suggested for patients with no known primary site or with multiple prior malignancies. Molecular and other biomarker testing can be performed on even modestly cellular fluid specimens and may allow patients to benefit from targeted therapy without the need for additional tissue biopsies.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Molecular tumour boards (MTBs) offer recommendations for potentially effective, but potentially burdensome, molecularly targeted treatments to a patient's treating physician. In this paper, we discuss the question of who is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate evidence base for any treatments recommended to a patient. We argue that, given that treating oncologists cannot usually offer a robust evaluation of the evidence underlying an MTB's recommendation, members of the MTB are responsible for ensuring that the evidence level is adequate. We explore two models for how to share responsibility between MTB members. According to the first model, each MTB member, as well as the treating physician, should be held maximally and equally responsible for the recommendations. We argue that this insufficiently accounts for differences in roles and expertise of MTB members. We propose instead that responsibility is delegated via relationships of trust. We argue if these relationships of trust are to be instances of reasonable trust, (a) MTBs should offer a clinical representative to whom a treating physician may delegate the responsibility of ensuring there is sufficient evidence for treatment recommendations, (b) the relationships of trust between the representative and the other MTB members should be clearly defined, and (c) MTB members should be carefully selected. Treating oncologists retain a responsibility to consider general limitations of the evidence for targeted treatments in assessing whether the treatment recommendation offered by an MTB's representative is adequate for a given clinical situation.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Due to tumor heterogeneity, most believe that effective treatments should be tailored to the features of an individual tumor or tumor subclass. It is still unclear, however, what information should be considered for optimal disease stratification, and most prior work focuses on tumor genomics. Here, we focus on the tumor microenvironment. Using a large‐scale coculture assay optimized to measure drug‐induced cell death, we identify tumor–stroma interactions that modulate drug sensitivity. Our data show that the chemo‐insensitivity typically associated with aggressive subtypes of breast cancer is not observed if these cells are grown in 2D or 3D monoculture, but is manifested when these cells are cocultured with stromal cells, such as fibroblasts. Furthermore, we find that fibroblasts influence drug responses in two distinct and divergent manners, associated with the tissue from which the fibroblasts were harvested. These divergent phenotypes occur regardless of the drug tested and result from modulation of apoptotic priming within tumor cells. Our study highlights unexpected diversity in tumor–stroma interactions, and we reveal new principles that dictate how fibroblasts alter tumor drug responses.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Diabetes has become a major burden of healthcare expenditure. Diabetes management following a uniform treatment algorithm is often associated with progressive treatment failure and development of diabetic complications. Recent advances in our understanding of the genomic architecture of diabetes and its complications have provided the framework for development of precision medicine to personalize diabetes prevention and management. In the present review, we summarized recent advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of diabetes and its complications. From a clinician's perspective, we attempted to provide a balanced perspective on the utility of genomic medicine in the field of diabetes. Using genetic information to guide management of monogenic forms of diabetes represents the best‐known examples of genomic medicine for diabetes. Although major strides have been made in genetic research for diabetes, its complications and pharmacogenetics, ongoing efforts are required to translate these findings into practice by incorporating genetic information into a risk prediction model for prioritization of treatment strategies, as well as using multi‐omic analyses to discover novel drug targets with companion diagnostics. Further research is also required to ensure the appropriate use of this information to empower individuals and healthcare professionals to make personalized decisions for achieving the optimal outcome.]]>

          <![CDATA[The big data revolution is making vast amounts of information available in all sectors of the economy including health care. One important type of data that is particularly relevant to medicine is observational data from actual practice. In comparison to experimental data from clinical studies, observational data offers much larger sample sizes and much broader coverage of patient variables. Properly combining observational data with experimental data can facilitate precision medicine by enabling detection of heterogeneity in patient responses to treatments and tailoring of health care to the specific needs of individuals. However, because it is high‐dimensional and uncontrolled, observational data presents unique methodological challenges. The modeling and analysis tools of the production and operations management field are well‐suited to these challenges and hence POM scholars are critical to the realization of precision medicine with its many benefits to society.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)A dynamic treatment regime is a sequence of decision rules, each corresponding to a decision point, that determine that next treatment based on each individual's own available characteristics and treatment history up to that point. We show that identifying the optimal dynamic treatment regime can be recast as a sequential optimization problem and propose a direct sequential optimization method to estimate the optimal treatment regimes. In particular, at each decision point, the optimization is equivalent to sequentially minimizing a weighted expected misclassification error. Based on this classification perspective, we propose a powerful and flexible C‐learning algorithm to learn the optimal dynamic treatment regimes backward sequentially from the last stage until the first stage. C‐learning is a direct optimization method that directly targets optimizing decision rules by exploiting powerful optimization/classification techniques and it allows incorporation of patient's characteristics and treatment history to improve performance, hence enjoying advantages of both the traditional outcome regression‐based methods (Q‐ and A‐learning) and the more recent direct optimization methods. The superior performance and flexibility of the proposed methods are illustrated through extensive simulation studies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)A design is proposed for randomized comparative trials with ordinal outcomes and prognostic subgroups. The design accounts for patient heterogeneity by allowing possibly different comparative conclusions within subgroups. The comparative testing criterion is based on utilities for the levels of the ordinal outcome and a Bayesian probability model. Designs based on two alternative models that include treatment‐subgroup interactions are considered, the proportional odds model and a non‐proportional odds model with a hierarchical prior that shrinks toward the proportional odds model. A third design that assumes homogeneity and ignores possible treatment‐subgroup interactions also is considered. The three approaches are applied to construct group sequential designs for a trial of nutritional prehabilitation versus standard of care for esophageal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation and surgery, including both untreated patients and salvage patients whose disease has recurred following previous therapy. A simulation study is presented that compares the three designs, including evaluation of within‐subgroup type I and II error probabilities under a variety of scenarios including different combinations of treatment‐subgroup interactions.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Recent advances in molecular biology of cancer have led to the development of targeted agents, mainly of monoclonal antibodies and small‐molecule compounds. Unlike traditional drugs that inhibit DNA synthesis and mitosis, these agents target the signaling pathways of cancer cells, stroma, and vasculature in tumor tissues. For gynecologic cancers, drugs targeting angiogenesis such as anti‐ VEGF antibody have been used in the treatment of advanced or recurrent ovarian and cervical cancers, and the drugs targeting homologous recombination deficiency such as PARP inhibitors have been approved for maintenance after chemotherapy in platinum‐sensitive ovarian cancer. In addition, novel immunotherapy using the immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti‐ PD ‐1 antibody has received much attention for modulation of local immunity, resulting in the durable response of platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer. In the precision medicine era, further understanding of cancer genomics and identification of predictive biomarkers are essential to ensure better health for women with gynecologic cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Competing risk analysis considers event times due to multiple causes or of more than one event types. Commonly used regression models for such data include (1) cause‐specific hazards model, which focuses on modeling one type of event while acknowledging other event types simultaneously, and (2) subdistribution hazards model, which links the covariate effects directly to the cumulative incidence function. Their use in the presence of high‐dimensional predictors are largely unexplored. Motivated by an analysis using the linked SEER‐Medicare database for the purposes of predicting cancer versus noncancer mortality for patients with prostate cancer, we study the accuracy of prediction and variable selection of existing machine learning methods under both models using extensive simulation experiments, including different approaches to choosing penalty parameters in each method. We then apply the optimal approaches to the analysis of the SEER‐Medicare data.]]>

          <![CDATA[Gastric cancer patients positive for peritoneal cytology are at increased risk of tumor recurrence, but although a certain proportion of cytology‐positive patients relapse rapidly with aggressive progression, others survive longer with conventional chemotherapies. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to stratify patients for more intensive therapy and poses a substantial challenge for the implementation of precision medicine. We developed a new approach to identify biologically malignant subpopulations in cytology‐positive gastric cancer patients, using a green fluorescent protein ( GFP )‐expressing attenuated adenovirus in which the telomerase promoter regulates viral replication (TelomeScan, OBP ‐401). The fluorescence emitted from TelomeScan‐positive cells was successfully quantified using a multi‐mode microplate reader. We then analyzed clinical peritoneal washes obtained from 68 gastric cancer patients and found that patients positive for TelomeScan had a significantly worse prognosis. In 21 cytology‐positive patients, the median survival time of those who were TelomeScan positive (235 days) was significantly shorter than that for those who were TelomeScan negative (671 days; P = 0.0062). This fluorescent virus‐guided cytology detects biologically malignant cancer cells from the peritoneal washes of gastric cancer patients and may thus be useful for both therapy stratification and precision medicine approaches based on genetic profiling of disseminated cells.]]>

          <![CDATA[Over the past 15 years, three new classes of drugs, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors and sodium glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors have been approved to treat type 2 diabetes based on effects on glycemic control. Although large randomized controlled trials have played an important role in characterizing the efficacy and safety of these agents on a population level, questions remain about how best to individualize therapy and target the “right” medicine to the “right” patient. In contrast, few medicines have been approved to treat diabetic kidney disease and initiatives have been launched on both sides of the Atlantic to facilitate the development of effective personalized medicines for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. Increasingly, “omics,” imaging and other biomarkers will be used to match patients with therapies to which they are likely to respond best. This review addresses regulatory considerations related to precision medicine, draws lessons learned from other therapeutic areas and discusses efforts undertaken by the European (EMA) and United States (FDA) to facilitate the development of such therapies. Moving forward, an integrated approach that makes use of predictive preclinical models, innovative trial designs, observational “real‐world” data and novel statistical methodologies will likely be needed to complement inherently smaller RCTs conducted in more selected populations. Patient involvement will also be critical. Regulatory agencies are ready to engage in such approaches.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine endeavors to conform therapeutic interventions to the individuals being treated. Implicit to the concept of precision medicine is heterogeneity of treatment benefit among patients and patient subpopulations. Thus, precision medicine challenges conventional paradigms of clinical translational which have relied on estimates of population‐averaged effects to guide clinical practice. Basket trials comprise a class of experimental designs used to study solid malignancies that are devised to evaluate the effectiveness of a therapeutic strategy among patients defined by the presence of a particular drug target (often a genetic mutation) rather than a particular tumor histology. Acknowledging the potential for differential effectiveness on the basis of traditional criteria for cancer subtyping, evaluations of treatment effectiveness are conducted with respect to the “baskets” which collectively represent a partition of the targeted patient population consisting of discrete subtypes. Yet, designs of early basket trials have been criticized for their reliance on basketwise analysis strategies that suffered from limited power in the presence of imbalanced enrollment as well as failed to convey to the clinical community evidentiary measures for consistent effectiveness among the studied clinical subtypes. This article presents novel methodology for sequential basket trial design formulated with Bayesian monitoring rules. Interim analyses are based a novel hierarchical modeling strategy for sharing information among a collection of discrete potentially nonexchangeable subtypes. The methodology is demonstrated by analysis as well as permutation and simulation studies based on a recent basket trial designed to estimate the effectiveness of vemurafenib in B R A F <sup> V 600</sup> mutant non‐melanoma among six primary disease sites and histologies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Treatment response heterogeneity poses serious challenges for selecting treatment for many diseases. To understand this heterogeneity better and to help in determining the best patient‐specific treatments for a given disease, many clinical trials are collecting large amounts of patient level data before administering treatment in the hope that some of these data can be used to identify moderators of treatment effect. These data can range from simple scalar values to complex functional data such as curves or images. Combining these various types of baseline data to discover ‘biosignatures’ of treatment response is crucial for advancing precision medicine. Motivated by the problem of selecting optimal treatment for subjects with depression based on clinical and neuroimaging data, we present an approach that both identifies covariates associated with differential treatment effect and estimates a treatment decision rule based on these covariates. We focus on settings where there is a potentially large collection of candidate biomarkers consisting of both scalar and functional data. The validity of the approach proposed is justified via extensive simulation experiments and illustrated by using data from a placebo‐controlled clinical trial investigating antidepressant treatment response in subjects with depression.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Cancer heterogeneity is a notorious hallmark of this disease, and it is desirable to tailor effective treatments for each individual patient. Drug combinations have been widely accepted in cancer treatment for better therapeutic efficacy as compared to a single compound. However, experimental complexity and cost grow exponentially with more target compounds under investigation. The primary challenge remains to efficiently perform a large‐scale drug combination screening using a small number of patient primary samples for testing. Here, a scalable, easy‐to‐use, high‐throughput drug combination screening scheme is reported, which has the potential of screening all possible pairwise drug combinations for arbitrary number of drugs with multiple logarithmic mixing ratios. A “Christmas tree mixer” structure is introduced to generate a logarithmic concentration mixing ratio between drug pairs, providing a large drug concentration range for screening. A three‐layer structure design and special inlets arrangement facilitate simple drug loading process. As a proof of concept, an 8‐drug combination chip is implemented, which is capable of screening 172 different treatment conditions over 1032 3D cancer spheroids on a single chip. Using both cancer cell lines and patient‐derived cancer cells, effective drug combination screening is demonstrated for precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Research activity is in the core essence of pathology. Advancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis translates into better patient care. Because of their unique position, laboratorians are the best to accurately identify, annotate, and classify research specimens. They also are essential for the accurate interpretation of genomic testing. Currently, cytopathologists are moving to the center of patient care through active communication with clinicians and patients. There are certain research areas in which cytopathologists can be pioneers, such as image analysis, morphology research, and genotype‐phenotype association studies integrating morphologic and molecular features. Health service utilization research is another domain in which cytopathologists can excel. Successful research is a journey that necessitates multiple steps. It also involves building expertise in how to overcome obstacles and handle challenges.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Objective(#br)To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of quinidine in patients with KCNT 1 ‐related epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures ( EIMFS ) in the infantile period and to compare with the effect of quinidine on mutant channels in vitro.(#br)Methods(#br)We identified 4 patients with EIMFS with onset in the neonatal period, pathogenic variants in the KCNT 1 gene, and lack of response to AED s. Patients were prospectively enrolled, treated with quinidine, and monitored according to a predefined protocol. Electroclinical, neuroimaging, and genetic data were reviewed. Two patients had novel variants in the KCNT 1 gene that were modeled in Xenopus oocytes with channel properties characterized using electrophysiology recordings.(#br)Results(#br)Three of four patients were treated with quinidine early in their disease course, prior to 6 months of age. No significant side effects were noted with quinidine therapy. In addition, there were no significant changes in electroencephalography (EEG )–confirmed seizure burden during therapy, and patients had near hourly seizures before, during, and after treatment. Two patients had previously reported gain‐of‐function mutations, which demonstrated sensitivity to high levels of quinidine in the oocyte assay. Two patients with novel variants, showed characteristic gain‐of‐function and were thus predicted to be pathogenic. Of interest, these variants were essentially insensitive to high levels of quinidine.(#br)Significance(#br)Patients had no reported benefit to quinidine therapy despite age at treatment initiation. Pharmacogenetic results in oocytes were consistent with clinical treatment failure in 2 patients, suggesting that single‐dose pharmacologic assessment may be helpful in predicting which patients are exceedingly unlikely to achieve benefit with quinidine. In the 2 patients who had a lack of therapeutic benefit despite sensitivity to high concentrations of quinidine with in vitro oocyte assay , it is likely that the achievable exposure levels in the brain were too low to cause significant in vivo channel blockade.]]>

          <![CDATA[With the advancement in drug development, multiple treatments are available for a single disease. Patients can often benefit from taking multiple treatments simultaneously. For example, patients in Clinical Practice Research Datalink with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes can receive multiple treatments simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to estimate what combination therapy from which patients can benefit the most. However, to recommend the best treatment combination is not a single label but a multilabel classification problem. In this paper, we propose a novel outcome weighted deep learning algorithm to estimate individualized optimal combination therapy. The Fisher consistency of the proposed loss function under certain conditions is also provided. In addition, we extend our method to a family of loss functions, which allows adaptive changes based on treatment interactions. We demonstrate the performance of our methods through simulations and real data analysis.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Molecularly, breast cancer represents a highly heterogenous family of neoplastic disorders, with substantial interpatient variations regarding genetic mutations, cell composition, transcriptional profiles, and treatment response. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient‐by‐patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA‐specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor‐suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene‐therapy, while its catalytically‐dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses. In this review, CRISPR strategies for the advancement of breast cancer diagnostics, modeling, and treatment are highlighted, culminating in a perspective on developing a precision medicine‐based approach against breast cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Since psychiatric disorders have genetic architectures dominated by common variants of small effects, successful elucidation in psychiatric genetics necessitates large sample sizes. Collaboration and unconventional ascertainment methods are required to fulfill this need. Electronic health records have been increasingly seen as holding great potential for research, although they often pose substantial technical, legal and ethical challenges. Universal health care and national‐scale registers with comprehensive medical, developmental, demographic, and geographic information make the Nordic countries ideal for psychiatric genetic epidemiology. The Genomic Aggregation Project in Sweden is gathering genetic data from subjects with and without complex genetic diseases in a single location for standardized processing and use in a wide variety of scientific investigations. Thirty groups with >160 K genotyped samples have joined GAPS. Although GAPS is general across medicine, many psychiatric disorders are represented within GAPS, and initial studies will focus on major depressive disorder. Through in‐depth genetic investigations, the genes and pathways that will be identified can be leveraged for predictive and drug‐development purposes. Sweden offers exceptional possibilities for psychiatric genetics, and GAPS aims to harness the wealth of available information for research to improve human health.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objectives(#br)Published cost estimates for cystic fibrosis (CF) are based on older data and do not reflect increased use of specialty drugs in recent years. We assessed recent trends in healthcare expenditures for CF patients in the United States (US) with employer‐sponsored health insurance.(#br)Methods(#br)The study is a retrospective analysis of claims data for privately insured individuals aged 0‐64 years who were continuously enrolled in non‐capitated plans for at least 1 calendar year during 2010‐2016. Mean annual expenditures during a calendar year were calculated for individuals who met a claims‐based CF case definition. Average annual growth rates were calculated through linear regression of the natural logarithm of annual expenditures.(#br)Results(#br)The annual CF prevalence was 1.1‐1.4 per 10 000 adults and 2.9‐3.0 per 10 000 children. Average spending adjusted for inflation nearly doubled from roughly $67 000 per patient in 2010 and 2011 to approximately $131 000 per patient in 2016. Inflation‐adjusted spending on outpatient and inpatient care increased by 0.5% and 2.5% per year, respectively, whereas pharmaceutical spending increased by 20.2% per year. Virtually all of the growth in pharmaceutical spending was accounted for by spending on specialty drugs; inflation‐adjusted spending on other medications increased by 1.3% per year. The annual growth rate in pharmaceutical spending rose by 33.1% during 2014‐2016, the years during which lumacaftor/ivacaftor was introduced.(#br)Conclusions(#br)Per‐patient expenditures for privately‐insured patients with CF almost doubled during 2010‐2016; specialty drugs were largely responsible for this increase, with a major contribution from new, genotype‐targeted CFTR modulator medications.]]>

          <![CDATA[Clinical trials in the era of precision medicine require assessment of biomarkers to identify appropriate subgroups of patients for targeted therapy. In a biomarker‐stratified design (BSD), biomarkers are measured on all patients and used as stratification variables. However, such a trial can be both inefficient and costly, especially when the prevalence of the subgroup of primary interest is low and the cost of assessing the biomarkers is high. Efficiency can be improved and costs reduced by using enriched biomarker‐stratified designs, in which patients of primary interest, typically the biomarker‐positive patients, are oversampled. We consider a special type of enrichment design, an auxiliary variable–enriched design (AEBSD), in which enrichment is based on some inexpensive auxiliary variable that is positively correlated with the true biomarker. The proposed AEBSD reduces the total cost of the trial compared with a standard BSD when the prevalence rate of true biomarker positivity is small and the positive predictive value ( P P V ) of the auxiliary biomarker is larger than the prevalence rate. In addition, for an AEBSD, we can immediately randomize the patients selected in the screening process without waiting for the result of the true biomarker test, reducing the treatment waiting time. We propose an adaptive Bayesian method to adjust the assumed P P V while the trial is ongoing. Numerical studies and an example illustrate the approach. An R package is available.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)In uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a consensus regarding appropriate medical therapy (AMT) before surgical intervention has been published in the form of “appropriateness criteria” for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We sought to determine why tertiary surgeons may deviate from the suggested criteria and evaluated whether those deviations result in change in outcomes.(#br)Methods(#br)Patients with uncomplicated CRS were prospectively enrolled over the course of 1 year. The 22‐item Sino‐Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT‐22), a general health outcome out of 100, and a physician form, indicating management pathway and decision making, was completed at each visit over a 6‐month follow‐up period. A descriptive analysis was used to quantify reasons for veering from the “appropriateness criteria,” and repeated linear regression modeling was used to measure whether compliance impacted SNOT‐22, general health, and Lund‐Kennedy (LK) scores over the period of study.(#br)Results(#br)One hundred fifty‐five patients were enrolled. Sixty‐eight percent followed the appropriate management pathway based on their presentation and the suggested criteria. Disparate reasons were documented for deviation in the other 32%, and, despite establishing several predictive categories, “other” was the most common reason, with various explanations well documented. SNOT‐22, general health, and LK scores were not statistically impacted by compliancy status ( p > 0.05).(#br)Conclusion(#br)The suggested “appropriateness criteria” predict a management pathway for the majority of CRS patients. However, in a tertiary sinus center, surgeons may deviate from that model with a significant minority of their patients, for multiple reasons, without causing a change in outcomes.]]>

          <![CDATA[Gene‐specific promoter methylation is involved in gene silencing and is an important cancer biomarker. Cancer‐specific methylation patterns have been observed and clinically validated for numerous gene promoters, but the knowledge gleaned from this large body of work is currently under‐utilized in the clinic. Methylation‐specific PCR is currently the gold standard method for clinical methylation assessment, but several research groups have proposed hybridization‐based techniques which could be simpler to implement and provide more accurate results. However, the sensitivity of this easier alternative must be improved dramatically in order to compete with methylation‐specific PCR. Efficient sample capture is a key step in maximizing sensitivity, so here we investigate the key parameters involved in (i) maximizing the capture of gene‐specific target DNA molecules at the surfaces of functionalized, magnetic microparticles and (ii) recognizing DNA methylation using an engineered methyl‐CpG‐binding domain (MBD) protein. The magnetic bead density, the probe concentration, and the MBD concentration were very important for maximizing detection, and other variables such as the hybridization time also impacted the target capture efficiency but had a smaller effect on the overall methylation assay. The effect of genomic DNA on the capture of the target sequence was also investigated, and model methylated vs. unmethylated target sequences could be distinguished in the presence of 1 ng/μL genomic DNA. The findings we report related to the underlying binding events involved in hybridization‐based epigenotyping can be leveraged in combination with the many signal amplification and detection approaches that are currently being developed. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This article analyzes the availability of different diagnostic procedures of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the reimbursement landscape of drugs for NSCLC in countries of central and southeastern Europe (CEE).(#br)A survey was conducted by the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group. Results of the survey show that both availability and reimbursement of diagnoses of molecular alterations in NSCLC, the detection of which is essential for therapeutic decisions, varies widely between countries of CEE. Not only is “reflex” testing often substituted by analyses performed only “on demand,” but reimbursement of such assessments varies widely between unavailability and payments by the health care system or even pharmaceutical companies. It was concluded that a structured access to testing and reimbursement should be the aim in order to provide patients with appropriate therapeutic options.(#br)Implications for Practice(#br)This article provides an overview of the limitations in lung cancer treatment in countries of central and southeastern Europe, as well as the reimbursement status of various lung cancer treatment regimens in these countries, which directly impacts treatment options.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is an important prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer, which is currently determined in clinical practice by invasive SLN biopsy.(#br)Purpose(#br)To noninvasively predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer using dynamic contrast‐enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intra‐ and peritumoral radiomics features combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor.(#br)Study Type(#br)Retrospective.(#br)Population(#br)A total of 163 breast cancer patients (55 positive SLN and 108 negative SLN).(#br)Field Strength/Sequence(#br)1.5T, T<sub>1</sub>‐weighted DCE‐MRI.(#br)Assessment(#br)A total of 590 radiomic features were extracted for each patient from both intratumoral and peritumoral regions of interest. To avoid overfitting, the dataset was randomly separated into a training set (∼67%) and a validation set (∼33%). The prediction models were built with the training set using logistic regression on the most significant radiomic features in the training set combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics. The prediction performance was further evaluated in the independent validation set.(#br)Statistical Tests(#br)Mann–Whitney U ‐test, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed.(#br)Results(#br)Combining radiomic features with clinicopathologic characteristics, six features were automatically selected in the training set to establish the prediction model of SLN metastasis. In the independent validation set, the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869 (NPV = 0.886). Using radiomic features alone in the same procedure, 4 features were selected and the validation set AUC was 0.806 (NPV = 0.824).(#br)Data Conclusion(#br)This is the first attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using DCE‐MRI radiomics to predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics improved the prediction performance. This study provides noninvasive methods to evaluate SLN status for guiding further treatment of breast cancer patients, and can potentially benefit those with negative SLN, by eliminating unnecessary invasive lymph node removal and the associated complications, which is a step further towards precision medicine.(#br)Level of Evidence : 1(#br)Technical Efficacy : Stage 2(#br)J.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)With the advent of widespread genomic testing for diagnostic indications and disease risk assessment, there is increased need to optimize genetic counseling services to support the scalable delivery of precision medicine. Here, we describe how we operationalized the reciprocal engagement model of genetic counseling practice to develop a framework of counseling components and strategies for the delivery of genomic results. This framework was constructed based upon qualitative research with patients receiving genomic counseling following online receipt of potentially actionable complex disease and pharmacogenomics reports. Consultation with a transdisciplinary group of investigators, including practicing genetic counselors, was sought to ensure broad scope and applicability of these strategies for use with any large‐scale genomic testing effort. We preserve the provision of pre‐test education and informed consent as established in Mendelian/single‐gene disease genetic counseling practice. Following receipt of genomic results, patients are afforded the opportunity to tailor the counseling agenda by selecting the specific test results they wish to discuss, specifying questions for discussion, and indicating their preference for counseling modality. The genetic counselor uses these patient preferences to set the genomic counseling session and to personalize result communication and risk reduction recommendations. Tailored visual aids and result summary reports divide areas of risk (genetic variant, family history, lifestyle) for each disease to facilitate discussion of multiple disease risks. Post‐counseling, session summary reports are actively routed to both the patient and their physician team to encourage review and follow‐up. Given the breadth of genomic information potentially resulting from genomic testing, this framework is put forth as a starting point to meet the need for scalable genetic counseling services in the delivery of precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Electronic health records contain patient‐level data collected during and for clinical care. Data within the electronic health record include diagnostic billing codes, procedure codes, vital signs, laboratory test results, clinical imaging, and physician notes. With repeated clinic visits, these data are longitudinal, providing important information on disease development, progression, and response to treatment or intervention strategies. The near universal adoption of electronic health records nationally has the potential to provide population‐scale real‐world clinical data accessible for biomedical research, including genetic association studies. For this research potential to be realized, high‐quality research‐grade variables must be extracted from these clinical data warehouses. We describe here common and emerging electronic phenotyping approaches applied to electronic health records, as well as current limitations of both the approaches and the biases associated with these clinically collected data that impact their use in research. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)A sequentially adaptive Bayesian design is presented for a clinical trial of cord‐blood‐derived natural killer cells to treat severe haematologic malignancies. Given six prognostic subgroups defined by disease type and severity, the goal is to optimize cell dose in each subgroup. The trial has five co‐primary outcomes: the times to severe toxicity, cytokine release syndrome, disease progression or response and death. The design assumes a multivariate Weibull regression model, with marginals depending on dose, subgroup and patient frailties that induce association between the event times. Utilities of all possible combinations of the non‐fatal outcomes over the first 100 days following cell infusion are elicited, with posterior mean utility used as a criterion to optimize the dose. For each subgroup, the design stops accrual to doses having an unacceptably high death rate and at the end of the trial selects the optimal safe dose. A simulation study is presented to validate the design's safety, ability to identify optimal doses and robustness, and to compare it with a simplified design that ignores patient heterogeneity.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by severe congenital or immune‐mediated deficiency in ADAMTS 13, the enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers. This rare condition leads invariably and rapidly to a fatal outcome in the absence of treatment, and therefore raises multiple diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The novel concepts and mechanisms identified in the laboratory for this disease have been rapidly and successfully translated into the clinic for the benefit of patients, making TTP an archetypal disease that has benefited from targeted therapies. After decades of empirical treatment with plasma exchange, identification of ADAMTS 13 as the key enzyme involved in TTP pathophysiology provided an explanation for the remarkable efficacy of plasma administration, in which the missing enzyme is replenished, and paved the way for development of a recombinant form of the enzyme. Similarly, the demonstration of a major role of anti‐ ADAMTS 13 antibodies through models of passive transfer of autoimmunity spurred development of immunomodulatory strategies based on B‐cell depletion. More recently, an inhibitor of the platelet‐von Willebrand factor interaction demonstrated efficacy in large clinical trials through prevention of formation of further microthrombi and protection of organs from ischemia.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Introduction(#br)Precision medicine is an important milestone toward the attainment of personalized medicine. A learning health system (LHS) may facilitate the evidence collection and knowledge generation process for disease‐based research and for the diagnosis, classification, or treatment of each disease subtype to improve patient care.(#br)Methods(#br)The LHS design and implementation used by Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH) in Taiwan for their newly funded precision medicine research, a dementia registry study, was modeled from an LHS developed at the National Institutes of Health in the United States. This Clinical Informatics and Management System (CIMS), including its subsystems, facilitates and enhances operations associated with the institutional review board, clinical research data collection and study management, the hospital biobank, and the participating health research centers to support their precision medicine research aimed at improving patient care.(#br)Results(#br)The implementation of a shared‐design, full‐cycle LHS with an enhanced CIMS, combined with hospital‐based real‐world data marts, has made the TCVGH dementia registry study a reality. The research data, including clinical assessment and genomics analysis information collected in CIMS, combined with data marts, are the foundation of the TCVGH dementia registry for outcome analyses. These high‐quality datasets are useful for clinical validation, new hypotheses, and knowledge generation, leading to new clinical recommendations or guidelines for better patient treatment and care. The cyclic data flow supports the full‐cycle LHS for TCVGH's dementia research to improve the care of elderly patients.(#br)Conclusions(#br)Knowledge generation requires high‐quality research and health care datasets. While the details of LHS implementation methods in the United States and Taiwan may differ slightly, the LHS concept design and basic system architecture, with improved CIMSs, were proven feasible. As a result, learning health processes in support of translational research and the potential for improvement in patient care were significantly facilitated.]]>

          <![CDATA[Identification of subgroups with differential treatment effects in randomized trials is attracting much attention. Many methods use regression tree algorithms. This article addresses 2 important questions arising from the subgroups: how to ensure that treatment effects in subgroups are not confounded with effects of prognostic variables and how to determine the statistical significance of treatment effects in the subgroups. We address the first question by selectively including linear prognostic effects in the subgroups in a regression tree model. The second question is more difficult because it falls within the subject of postselection inference. We use a bootstrap technique to calibrate normal‐theory t intervals so that their expected coverage probability, averaged over all the subgroups in a fitted model, approximates the desired confidence level. It can also provide simultaneous confidence intervals for all subgroups. The first solution is implemented in the GUIDE algorithm and is applicable to data with missing covariate values, 2 or more treatment arms, and outcomes subject to right censoring. Bootstrap calibration is applicable to any subgroup identification method; it is not restricted to regression tree models. Two real examples are used for illustration: a diabetes trial where the outcomes are completely observed but some covariate values are missing and a breast cancer trial where the outcome is right censored.]]>

          <![CDATA[Renal cell cancer (RCC) has become a prototype example of the extensive intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution of human cancers. However, there is little direct evidence on how the genetic heterogeneity impacts on drug response profiles of the cancer cells. Our goal was to determine how genomic clonal evolution impacts drug responses. Finding from our study could help to define the challenge that clonal evolution poses on cancer therapy. We established multiple patient‐derived cells (PDCs) from different tumor regions of four RCC patients, verified their clonal relationship to each other and to the uncultured tumor tissue by genome sequencing. Furthermore, comprehensive drug‐sensitivity testing with 460 oncological drugs was performed on all PDC clones. The PDCs retained many cancer‐specific copy number alterations and mutations in driver genes such as VHL, PBRM1, PIK3C2A, KMD5C and TSC2 genes. The drug testing highlighted vulnerability in the PDCs toward approved RCC drugs, such as the mTOR‐inhibitor temsirolimus, but also novel sensitivities were uncovered. The individual PDC clones from different tumor regions in a patient showed distinct drug–response profiles, suggesting that genomic heterogeneity contributes to the variability in drug responses. Studies of multiple PDCs from a patient with cancer are informative for elucidating cancer heterogeneity and for the determination on how the genomic evolution is manifested in cancer drug responsiveness. This approach could facilitate tailoring of drugs and drug combinations to individual patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with marked clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity. Specific pathways are thought to be involved in the pathomechanisms of different inflammatory phenotypes of asthma; however, direct in vivo comparison has not been performed.(#br)Methods(#br)We developed mouse models representing three different phenotypes of allergic airway inflammation—eosinophilic, mixed, and neutrophilic asthma via different methods of house dust mite sensitization and challenge. Transcriptomic analysis of the lungs, followed by the RT‐PCR, western blot, and confocal microscopy, was performed. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells cultured in air‐liquid interface were used to study the mechanisms revealed in the in vivo models.(#br)Results(#br)By whole‐genome transcriptome profiling of the lung, we found that airway tight junction (TJ), mucin, and inflammasome‐related genes are differentially expressed in these distinct phenotypes. Further analysis of proteins from these families revealed that Zo‐1 and Cldn18 were downregulated in all phenotypes, while increased Cldn4 expression was characteristic for neutrophilic airway inflammation. Mucins Clca1 (Gob5) and Muc5ac were upregulated in eosinophilic and even more in neutrophilic phenotype. Increased expression of inflammasome‐related molecules such as Nlrp3, Nlrc4, Casp‐1, and IL‐1β was characteristic for neutrophilic asthma. In addition, we showed that inflammasome/Th17/neutrophilic axis cytokine—IL‐1β—may transiently impair epithelial barrier function, while IL‐1β and IL‐17 increase mucin expressions in primary human bronchial epithelial cells.(#br)Conclusion(#br)Our findings suggest that differential expression of TJ, mucin, and inflammasome‐related molecules in distinct inflammatory phenotypes of asthma may be linked to pathophysiology and might reflect the differences observed in the clinic.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Although rare in the United States, gallbladder cancer (GBCA) is a common cause of cancer death in some parts of the world. To investigate regional differences in pathogenesis and outcomes for GBCA, tumor mutations were analyzed from a sampling of specimens.(#br)Methods(#br)Primary tumors from patients with GBCA who were treated in Chile, Japan, and the United States between 1999 and 2016 underwent targeted sequencing of known cancer‐associated genes. Fisher exact and Kruskal‐Wallis tests assessed differences in clinicopathologic and genetic factors. Kaplan‐Meier methods evaluated differences in overall survival from the time of surgery between mutations.(#br)Results(#br)A total of 81 patients were included. Japanese patients (11 patients) were older (median age, 72 years [range, 54‐81 years]) compared with patients from Chile (21 patients; median age, 59 years [range, 32‐73 years]) and the United States (49 patients; median age, 66 years [range, 46‐87 years]) ( P = .002) and had more well‐differentiated tumors (46% vs 0% for Chile/United States; P < .001) and fewer gallstone‐associated cancers (36% vs 67% for Chile and 69% for the United States; P = .13). Japanese patients had a median mutation burden of 6 (range, 1‐23) compared with Chile (median mutation burden, 7 [range, 3‐20]) and the United States (median mutation burden, 4 [range, 0‐27]) ( P = .006). Tumors from Japanese patients lacked AT‐rich interaction domain 1A ( ARID1A ) and phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutations, whereas Chilean tumors lacked Erb‐B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 ( ERBB3 ) and AT‐rich interaction domain 2 ( ARID2 ) mutations. SMAD family member 4 ( SMAD4 ) was found to be mutated similarly across centers (38% in Chile, 36% in Japan, and 27% in the United States; P = .68) and was univariately associated with worse overall survival (median, 10 months vs 25 months; P = .039). At least one potentially actionable gene was found to be altered in 80% of tumors.(#br)Conclusions(#br)Differences in clinicopathologic variables suggest the possibility of distinct GBCA pathogenesis in Japanese patients, which may be supported by differences in mutation pattern. Among all centers, SMAD4 mutations were detected in approximately one‐third of patients and may represent a converging factor associated with worse survival. The majority of patients carried mutations in actionable gene targets, which may inform the design of future trials.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Targeted therapy directed against rare disease‐propagating leukaemic stem cells ( LSC s) is a promising prospect for improving the outcome of acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) patients. Thus, distinguishing LSC s from normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPC s) is essential. The CLEC 12A receptor has been proposed as a specific marker of LSC s, and consequently as an appealing treatment target. To explore the role of CLEC 12A in further detail, we investigated whether a sorting strategy based on the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase and CLEC 12A expression could separate residual normal HSPC s from LSC s in bone marrow from 5 AML patients. We demonstrate that this distinction was possible in 2/5 cases, however with evidence of pre‐leukaemic mutations in the CLEC 12A‐ stem cells in one case. In contrast, cytogenetic and/or molecular aberrations were detected in both the CLEC 12A+/− cell subsets in 3/5 AML cases studied. Furthermore, targeted next generation sequencing ( NGS ) of the sorted cell subsets revealed a pronounced clonal heterogeneity in the CLEC 12A‐ cells suggestive of the leukaemia often originating in this immature cell subset. In conclusion, we provide proof‐of‐concept that precision diagnostics employing targeted cytogenetic/ NGS ‐based analyses on highly purified cell subsets could be a powerful tool for selecting patients eligible for LSC ‐directed therapy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Identification of the four standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (SMuRFs)—diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and cigarette smoking—has allowed the development of risk scores. These have been used in conjunction with primary and secondary prevention strategies targeting SM u RF s to reduce the burden of CAD . Recent studies show that up to 25% of ACS patients do not have any SM u RF s. Thus, SM u RF s do not explain the entire burden of CAD . There appears to be variation at the individual level rendering some individuals relatively susceptible or resilient to developing atherosclerosis. Important disease pathways remain to be discovered, and there is renewed enthusiasm to discover novel biomarkers, biological mechanisms, and therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. Two broad approaches are being taken: traditional approaches investigating known candidate pathways and unbiased omics approaches. We review recent progress in the field and discuss opportunities made possible by technological and data science advances. Developments in network analytics and machine learning algorithms used in conjunction with large‐scale multi‐omic platforms have the potential to uncover biological networks that may not have been identifiable using traditional approaches. These approaches are useful for both biomedical research and precision medicine strategies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne) is caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) are one emerging precision medicine treatment for Duchenne. DMD molecular genetic testing results guide precision‐therapy molecular eligibility, requiring healthcare providers to perform analyses currently uncommon in clinical laboratory and medical practices. Clear DMD variant notation and interpretation are key components of clinical care with the availability of precision medicine.(#br)Methods(#br)The DMD Open‐access Variant Explorer (DOVE) is a web‐based aid for DMD variant interpretation which additionally reports variant‐specific predicted molecular eligibility for therapy. DOVE was developed in Python and adapted to the Django Web framework, integrates existing open‐access tools, and does not rely on previous variant report/classification.(#br)Results(#br)DOVE [ www.dmd.nl/DOVE ] interprets colloquial and HGMD inputs of DMD variants to output HGMD variant nomenclature, theoretical molecular eligibility for therapy, and any predicted deleterious molecular consequences of therapy. DOVE relies on holistic in silico prediction of molecular eligibility for therapy in lieu of reference to an empirically defined, “variant‐eligible” list. Examples illustrate the advantage and necessity for holistic variant interpretation.(#br)Conclusion(#br)DOVE may prove useful for variant interpretation both at patient‐level and in large‐scale programs such as newborn screening and has broad application in concept to molecular genetic test result interpretation.]]>

          <![CDATA[Objective(#br)The aim of our study was to analyze the montelukast effectiveness in improving oculonasal symptoms, patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), and eosinophilic biomarkers in patients with nonallergic rhinitis eosinophilic syndrome (NARES).(#br)Methods(#br)We enrolled prospectively 80 symptomatic patients treated with 10 mg once a day of montelukast in monotherapy for 2 months. All patients were investigated before and after treatment. Nasal symptoms (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal itching), ocular symptoms (redness/puffiness, watery eyes), and other PROs (olfactory dysfunction, difficulty going to sleep, nighttime awakenings, and nasal congestion on awakening) were scored by visual analogic scale. The following clinical scores were assessed: Total Nasal Symptom Score (T4NSS), Total Ocular Symptom Score (T2OSS), Total Symptom Score of Patient‐Reported Outcomes (TSS‐PROs), and a Composite Symptoms Score (CSS). Patients were classified as responders when a reduction of at least 50% of the CSS was observed. Before and after treatment, the eosinophilic biomarkers in nasal lavage were analyzed: nasal eosinophilia (number of eosinophils per high power field), eotaxin‐1 and eotaxin‐2.(#br)Results(#br)After treatment, significant reductions were observed for all the symptom scores. Forty‐two of 78 patients were considered responders. A significant reduction of eosinophils in nasal mucosa and of levels of eotaxin‐1 and eotaxin‐2 in nasal lavage were observed after treatment in responder patients. Patients with asthma had an increased probability to be responders.(#br)Conclusion(#br)NARES patients may benefit from treatment with montelukast. In particular, the presence of concomitant asthma may be predictive of a greater efficacy.(#br)Level of Evidence(#br)2 Laryngoscope , 129:551–557, 2019]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that has reached the levels of a global epidemic. In order to achieve optimal glucose control, it is often necessary to rely on combination therapy of multiple drugs or insulin because uncontrolled glucose levels result in T2DM progression and enhanced risk of complications and mortality. Several antihyperglycemic agents have been developed over time, and T2DM pharmacotherapy should be prescribed based on suitability for the individual patient's characteristics. Pharmacogenetics is the branch of genetics that investigates how our genome influences individual responses to drugs, therapeutic outcomes, and incidence of adverse effects. In this review, we evaluated the pharmacogenetic evidences currently available in the literature, and we identified the top informative genetic variants associated with response to the most common anti‐diabetic drugs: metformin, DPP‐4 inhibitors/GLP1R agonists, thiazolidinediones, and sulfonylureas/meglitinides. Overall, we found 40 polymorphisms for each drug class in a total of 71 loci, and we examined the possibility of encouraging genetic screening of these variants/loci in order to critically implement decision‐making about the therapeutic approach through precision medicine strategies. It is possible then to anticipate that when the clinical practice will take advantage of the genetic information of the diabetic patients, this will provide a useful resource for the prevention of T2DM progression, enabling the identification of the precise drug that is most likely to be effective and safe for each patient and the reduction of the economic impact on a global scale.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Chronic fibrotic liver disease caused by viral or metabolic etiologies is a high‐risk condition for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Even after curative treatment of early‐stage HCC tumor, the carcinogenic microenvironment persists in the remnant diseased liver and supports the development of de novo HCC tumors ( de novo HCC recurrence). Therefore, prevention of HCC development in patients at risk of not only first‐primary but also second‐primary HCC tumors is theoretically the most impactful strategy to improve patient prognosis. However, no such therapy has been established to date. One major challenge is the identification of clinically relevant targets that can be achieved by utilizing the reverse‐engineering strategy of chemoprevention discovery, which integrates omics information from clinical cohorts with completed follow‐up for cancer development. Clinical and experimental studies have suggested etiology‐specific and generic candidate HCC chemoprevention strategies, including statins, antidiabetic drugs, selective molecular targeted agents, and dietary and nutritional substances. Clinical testing of the candidate compounds can be cost‐effectively performed by combining it with HCC risk biomarker evaluation to specify the target patient population most likely to benefit from the therapy. Nontoxic, generic agents will have broad clinical applicability across the diverse HCC etiologies and clinical contexts and are expected to substantially improve the still dismal prognosis of HCC.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Pathological outcomes are definitely the most important prognostic factors in gastric cancer, but they can be obtained only after surgical resection. Use of preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is becoming widespread for aggressive human cancer, so clinical factors such as macroscopic features are important as they are highly predictive for patient prognosis. In gastric cancer, the macroscopic type represents a distinct prognosis; Type 0 represents early gastric cancer with excellent prognosis, but, among advanced tumors, giant Type III and Type IV tumors have a dismal prognosis. Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) Stomach Cancer Study Group adopted macroscopic features as high‐risk entities in clinical trials. It makes sense for risk classification to use macroscopic phenotypes because The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network has lately subcategorized different histologies associated with specific macroscopic types by the molecular features of the whole genome. Dismal prognosis of Type IV gastric cancer is notorious, but similar prognosis was seen in giant Type III gastric cancer defined as 8 cm or beyond, both of which are unique for their propensity of peritoneal dissemination. In this review, clinical relevance including prognosis of such macroscopic high‐risk features will be separately debated in the context of precision medicine and updated prognostic outcomes will be presented under the present standard therapy of curative surgery followed by postoperative S‐1 chemotherapy. Moreover, promising emerging novel therapeutic strategies including trimodal potent regimens or intraperitoneal chemotherapy will be described for such aggressive gastric cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Patient classification has widespread biomedical and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction. A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be interpretable to drive hypothesis‐driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks, which meets these criteria. In a cancer survival benchmark dataset integrating up to six data types in four cancer types, netDx significantly outperforms most other machine‐learning approaches across most cancer types. Compared to traditional machine‐learning‐based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway‐level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in breast cancer and asthma. netDx can serve as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a free software implementation of netDx with automation workflows.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Purpose(#br)Quantitative benefit‐risk (B‐R) assessments are used to characterize treatment by combining key benefits and risks into a single metric but have historically been done for the “average” patient. Our aim was to conduct an individualized assessment for the oral antiplatelet vorapaxar by combining trial and real‐world data to further personalize the treatment profiles.(#br)Methods(#br)Using linked UK health care databases, we developed risk prediction equations for key ischemic and bleeding events using Cox proportional hazards models. Trial hazard ratios, relative to placebo, were applied to baseline risk estimates to compute expected attributable risks, summed to derive a per‐patient net clinical benefit (NCB). High risk subgroups were defined a priori, and Gaussian mixture models (GMM) were fit to characterize the NCB distribution and identify subgroups with similar NCBs.(#br)Results(#br)NCB was consistently positive for all subgroups, likely due to the outcome correlation, and would remain positive with a 12‐fold increase in bleeding risk. GMMs identified three distinct NCB subgroups.

          <![CDATA[The rapid development of precision medicine is introducing a new era of significance in medicine. However, attaining precision medicine is an ambitious goal that is bound to encounter some challenges. Here, we have put forward some difficulties or questions that should be addressed by the progress in this field. The proposed issues include the long road to precision medicine for all types of diseases as the unknown domains of the human genome hinder the development of precision medicine. The challenges in the acquisition and analysis of large amounts of omics data, including difficulties in the establishment of a library of biological samples and large‐scale data analysis, as well as the challenges of informed consent and medical ethics in precision medicine, must be overcome to attain the goals of precision medicine. To date, precision medicine programs have accomplished many preliminary achievements and will help to drive a dramatic revolution in clinical practices for the medical community. Through these advances, the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases will achieve many breakthroughs. This project is just beginning and requires a great deal of time and money. Precision medicine also requires extensive collaboration. Ultimately, these difficulties can be overcome. We should realize that precision medicine is good for patients, but there is still a long way to go.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)Plasma‐based cell‐free DNA is an attractive biospecimen for assessing somatic mutations due to minimally‐invasive real‐time sampling. However, next generation sequencing (NGS) of cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) may not be appropriate for all patients with advanced prostate cancer (PC).(#br)Methods(#br)Blood was obtained from advanced PC patients for plasma‐based sequencing. UW‐OncoPlex, a ∼2 Mb multi‐gene NGS panel performed in the CLIA/CAP environment, was optimized for detecting cfDNA mutations. Tumor tissue and germline samples were sequenced for comparative analyses. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the clinical characteristic associated with the successful detection of somatic cfDNA alterations (ie detection of at least one clearly somatic PC mutation).(#br)Results(#br)Plasma for cfDNA sequencing was obtained from 93 PC patients along with tumor tissue ( N = 67) and germline ( N = 93) controls. We included data from 76 patients (72 prostate adenocarcinoma; 4 variant histology PC) in the analysis. Somatic DNA aberrations were detected in 34 cfDNA samples from patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. High PSA level, high tumor volume, and castration‐resistance were significantly associated with successful detection of somatic cfDNA alterations. Among samples with somatic mutations detected, the cfDNA assay detected 93/102 (91%) alterations found in tumor tissue, yielding a clustering‐corrected sensitivity of 92% (95% confidence interval 88‐97%). All germline pathogenic variants present in lymphocyte DNA were also detected in cfDNA ( N = 12). Somatic mutations from cfDNA were detected in 30/33 (93%) instances when PSA was >10 ng/mL.(#br)Conclusions(#br)Disease burden, including a PSA >10 ng/mL, is strongly associated with detecting somatic mutations from cfDNA specimens.]]>

          <![CDATA[Objective(#br)We consider how to choose an antidepressant ( AD ) medication for the treatment of clinical depression.(#br)Method(#br)A narrative review was undertaken addressing antidepressant ‘choice’ considering a range of parameters either weighted by patients and clinicians or suggested in the scientific literature. Findings were synthesised and incorporated with clinical experience into a model to assist AD choice.(#br)Results(#br)Efficacy studies comparing AD s offer indicative guidance, while precision psychiatry prediction based on genetics, developmental trauma, neuroimaging, behavioural and cognitive biomarkers, currently has limited clinical utility. Our model offers guidance for AD choice by assessing first for the presence of a depressive subtype or symptom cluster and matching choice of AD class accordingly. Failing this, an AD can be chosen based on depression severity. Within‐class choice can be determined by reference to personality style, patient preference, medical or psychiatric comorbidities and side‐effect profile.(#br)Conclusion(#br)Clarification of AD choice would occur if medications are trialled in specific depressive subtypes rather than using the generic diagnosis of major depressive disorder ( MDD ). Such ‘top‐down’ methods could be enhanced by ‘bottom‐up’ studies to classify individuals according to symptom clusters and biomarkers with AD efficacy tested in these categories. Both methods could be utilised for personalised AD choice.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Background(#br)In the past decade, trackable smart drug delivery systems have played important roles in the treatment of many diseases such as cancer because the drug carriers can be visualized through their distinct physical properties. However, it is still difficult to achieve precise drug delivery because such systems usually rely on a single imaging system.(#br)Aim(#br)This study aimed to present a novel type of multimodality imaging‐guided strategy to visualize the drug carriers of eccentric magnetic microcapsule (EMM) designed for potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).(#br)Method and results(#br)The EMMs were prepared by using a three‐phase microfluidic device. The as‐prepared EMMs embedded with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles are magnetic, with high density and acoustic impedance, allowing for visualization by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) imaging during local injection. The release of drug from these EMMs can be further controlled by an external electromagnetic field (EMF). As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the process of multimodality imaging to guide local injection and the controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) from the EMMs in a phantom. We showed that the release rate of DOX was directly correlated to the strength of the EMF. In addition, we cocultured green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐transfected HeLa cancer cells with the DOX‐loaded EMMs and documented their apoptosis by DOX following the release triggered by EMF.(#br)Conclusion(#br)The results suggest that these EMMs serve both as contrast agents that can be visualized by multimodality imaging techniques and as smart drug delivery systems, with great potential for precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Model‐informed precision dosing (MIPD) is biosimulation in healthcare to predict the drug dose for a given patient based on their individual characteristics that is most likely to improve efficacy and/or lower toxicity compared with traditional dosing. Despite widespread use of biosimulation in drug development, MIPD has not been adopted beyond academic‐hospital centers. A reason for this is that MIPD requires more supporting evidence in the language that everyday doctors understand—evidence‐based medicine. In this commentary, codevelopment of companion MIPD tools during drug development is advocated as a way to accelerate the generation of the evidence required for broader clinical implementation of MIPD. Such tools have the potential to evolve into “dynamic” prescribing information that could guide dose selection for complex patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Bladder cancer ( BC ) is a complex disease and could be classified into nonmuscle‐invasive BC ( NMIBC ) or muscle‐invasive BC ( MIBC ) subtypes according to the distinct genetic background and clinical prognosis. Until now, the golden standard and confirmed diagnosis of BC is cystoscopy and the major problems of BC are the high rate of recurrence and high costs in the clinic. Recent molecular and genetic studies have provided perspectives on the novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets of BC . In this article, we provided an overview of the traditional diagnostic approaches of BC , and introduced some new imaging, endoscopic, and immunological diagnostic technology in the accurate diagnosis of BC . Meanwhile, the minimally invasive precision treatment technique, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, gene therapy, and targeted therapy of BC were also included. Here, we will overview the diagnosis and therapy methods of BC used in clinical practice, focusing on their specificity, efficiency, and safety. On the basis of the discussion of the benefits of precision medicine in BC , we will also discuss the challenges and limitations facing the non‐invasive methods of diagnosis and precision therapy of BC . The molecularly targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches, and gene therapy methods to BC treatment improved the prognosis and overall survival of BC patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Aim(#br)Recent advances in next‐generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow for evaluation of genetic alterations in various cancer‐related genes in daily clinical practice. Archival formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue is often used for NGS‐based clinical sequencing assays; however, the success rate of NGS assays using archival FFPE tumor tissue is reported to be lower than that using fresh tumor tissue. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of ultrasound (US)‐guided liver tumor biopsy for NGS‐based multiplex gene assays.(#br)Methods(#br)We compared the success rate of NGS assays between archival FFPE tumor tissues and US‐guided liver tumor biopsy tissues, and summarized the treatment progress of the patients.(#br)Results(#br)Next‐generation sequencing assays using US‐guided liver biopsy samples were successful in all patients (22/22), whereas the success rate with archival FFPE tumor tissue was 84.8% (151/178, P < 0.05). At least one potentially actionable genetic alteration was identified from the US‐guided liver biopsy samples in 20 of 22 patients. Among the 18 patients with actionable genetic alterations targetable with drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, eight initiated mutation‐driven targeted therapies. Of these eight patients, four achieved partial response or stable disease for at least 4 months, and three were not assessable for response due to short exposure. There were no biopsy‐related complications requiring additional treatment.(#br)Conclusion(#br)Our findings suggest that US‐guided liver tumor biopsy is a useful and safe method for obtaining high‐quality samples for NGS‐based clinical sequencing. In cases with metastatic liver tumors, US‐guided biopsy should be considered to provide accurate and optimal sequencing results for patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to become the second cause of cancer-related deaths by 2020. Although it has traditionally been approached as a disease, accumulated evidences point to the clinical heterogeneity of this disease, which translate into disparity in outcomes among the patients. Much emphasis has been put into patient classification introducing a platform for more tailored therapies. In the last 10 years, there have been important advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of PDAC, which has culminated with a comprehensive integrated genomic analysis from RNA expression profiles. Bailey et al. defined four subtypes and the different transcriptional networks underlying them. Firstly, we briefly describe and compare different subtyping approaches, which are mostly based on tissue mRNA expression analysis. We propose that these latest approaches to disease classification embrace not only those patients that are surgically resectable (20%), but even patients ineligible for surgery. Such considerations will include possible reclassification of these specific subtypes, enabling more personalized diagnosis and individualized treatment. The ultimate goal of this review is to identify current challenges in this area and summarize current efforts in developing clinical modalities that can effectively identify these subtypes in order to advance Precision Medicine. KEY MESSAGES(#br) • Pancreatic cancer can no longer be considered as one disease.(#br) • The heterogeneity underlying pancreatic cancer patients makes therapeutic options based on one-size-fits-all approach ineffective.(#br) • Identifying patients that could benefit from a specific treatment would help to avoid futile therapy approaches and to improve outcomes and quality of life of those whose long-term survival is unpromising.(#br)]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Lung cancer represents the leading cause of cancer mortality across the worlds. At present, less than 30% of the patients can undergo curative surgery, while the majority of them (65%) are diagnosed with metastatic disease and directed to systemic treatments. In this context there is a subset of patients (25%) with locally advanced stage disease whose outcome might be improved by using combined strategies of treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.(#br)Areas covered(#br): Here we reviewed possible combination strategies aimed to improve the outcome of lung cancer patients, focusing on the role of radiotherapy both in the adjuvant and oligo-metastatic setting and in synergy with immunotherapy, and finally, we afforded the new challenges concerning the advanced RT and precision oncology. We carried out a focused analysis concerning the key clinical management weaknesses as well as the potential that current research holds.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): We believe that the most promising clinical trials in this specific patient subset will build their rationale on the results of well-designed translational models aimed to test the combination of cytotoxic drugs, radiobiology, and immune-pharmacology. In this context, remarkable investigational fields are focused on the attempt to combine radiotherapy with chemo-immunological strategies and precision medicine protocols.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): The rapid development and dramatic decrease in cost of sequencing techniques have ushered the implementation of genomic testing in patient care. Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) techniques have been used increasingly in clinical laboratories to scan the whole or part of the human genome in order to facilitate diagnosis and/or prognostics of genetic disease. Despite many hurdles and debates, pharmacogenomics (PGx) is believed to be an area of genomic medicine where precision medicine could have immediate impact in the near future.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This review focuses on lessons learned through early attempts of clinically implementing PGx testing; the challenges and opportunities that PGx testing brings to precision medicine in the era of NGS.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Replacing targeted analysis approach with NGS for PGx testing is neither technically feasible nor necessary currently due to several technical limitations and uncertainty involved in interpreting variants of uncertain significance for PGx variants. However, reporting PGx variants out of clinical whole exome or whole genome sequencing (WES/WGS) might represent additional benefits for patients who are tested by WES/WGS.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A hallmark of cancer is evasion of apoptosis leading to tumor progression and drug resistance. Biomarker research has become a sign of the times, and proteins involved in apoptosis may be used for clinical diagnostic or prognostic purposes in cancer treatment. The recent progress in proteomic technology has triggered an emerging number of researchers to study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the apoptotic signal transduction pathways in cancer.(#br)Areas covered(#br): A PubMed search for ‘Proteomics’ and ‘cancer’ and ‘chemotherapy’ and ‘apoptosis’ has been conducted for literature until December 2017.(#br)Results(#br): The study of apoptotic protein signatures in cancer provides valuable information for more effective prognosis, response to therapy and the identification of novel drug targets. A huge number of bioinformatic tools are available to interpret raw data. For quantification, mass spectrometry is the most reliable technique.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): This field of research is, however, still in its infancy and more intensive research is warranted to explore the full potential of biomarkers for clinical use. Progress in this field is influenced by the detection limit of current quantification methods as well as patient and cancer inter-individual profiles.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): With high-throughput DNA analysis with next-generation sequencing (NGS), a new area of comprehensive molecular diagnostics is entering clinic. The profile of biomarkers (mutations and other abnormalities) may lay the foundation for precision treatment. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents a challenge with its many aberrations spread over all pathways. Furthermore, suitable samples for molecular diagnostics are difficult to obtain, both for tissue-based (biopsy, cytology) and blood-based (cell-free DNA and circulating tumor cells [CTC]) assays.(#br)Areas covered(#br): Biomarkers, material, methods, and management of biomarkers for PDAC in precision treatment. Biomarkers refer multiple biomarkers at the same time. Material refers to the different biological sources including blood-based approaches with CTCs. Methods cover the analysis techniques such as NGS and RNA sequencing. Management comprises the handling of NGS and data analysis, as well as the need for clinically applicable, evidence-based recommendations.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Outstanding problems are the procurement of samples suitable for multiplex biomarker analysis such as NGS. This may be overcome by single-cell sequencing. The final challenge, common to all approaches beyond a limited panel of genes, will be the holistic, evidence-based analysis of NGS data for making clinically relevant treatment recommendations. Outcome studies including cost-effectiveness are pivotal prior to reimbursement.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, lethal and expensive rare disease affecting more than 85,000 people worldwide. CF is caused by more than 2000 loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Personalized interventions on individual CF patients probably constitute the future of CF management.(#br)Areas covered(#br): The molecular genetics exploration of CF has led in the last years to the development of mutation-specific therapies that aim at directly targeting the mutant CFTR to reverse disease phenotype. Here, we will summarize the strategies of drug repositioning, i.e. the use of ‘old drugs’ for ‘new purposes’ in the perspective of a personalized approach to CF treatment.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Rare diseases like CF may well enter the era of precision medicine. A personalized/repositioning medicine in CF could help to provide the right drug to the right patient and potentially reduce the costs of developing disease-modifying drugs.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Hypertension is a complex and multifactorial cardiovascular disorder. With different mechanisms contributing to a different extent to an individual’s blood pressure, the discovery of novel pathogenetic principles of hypertension is challenging. However, there is an urgent and unmet clinical need to improve prevention, detection, and therapy of hypertension in order to reduce the global burden associated with hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases.(#br)Areas covered(#br): Proteomic techniques have been applied in reductionist experimental models including angiotensin II infusion models in rodents and the spontaneously hypertensive rat in order to unravel mechanisms involved in blood pressure control and end organ damage. In humans proteomic studies mainly focus on prediction and detection of organ damage, particularly of heart failure and renal disease. While there are only few proteomic studies specifically addressing human primary hypertension, there are more data available in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, such as preeclampsia. We will review these studies and discuss implications of proteomics on precision medicine approaches.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Despite the potential of proteomic studies in hypertension there has been moderate progress in this area of research. Standardized large-scale studies are required in order to make best use of the potential that proteomics offers in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Human biological samples like tissues, cells, blood, and other body fluids including associated information on the sample donor/patient are a key resource for research toward identifying determinants and mechanisms of individual diseases. Biobanks collect, preserve, and provide access to this resource in a transparent and quality controlled manner in compliance with ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements.(#br)Areas covered(#br): Precision medicine research requires access to sufficient numbers of samples and data that properly cover the broad spectrum of disease sub-entities relevant for targeted therapies. To address this demand samples and data from different biobanks in different countries must be suitable for integrated analyses. This is only possible if samples and data meet common quality criteria. Therefore international standards (e.g. CEN Technical Specifications or ISO Standards) have to be implemented for sample pre-analytics, covering all steps from sample collection from the patient to isolation of biomolecules. Furthermore, data management becomes increasingly important because samples have to be linked with detailed descriptions of disease phenotypes and re-use of data generated from samples by omics technologies has to be supported.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Data and quality management become increasingly important, and biobanks will develop from a sample provider to a data and knowledge provider.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex psychiatric condition characterized by craving, compulsive seeking, loss of control of alcohol consumption as well as the emergence of negative emotional states during withdrawal. Despite the large socioeconomic burden of AUD, therapeutic treatment options lag behind.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This review covers pharmacotherapies currently in phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of AUDs listed on clinicaltrials.gov. We discuss drug therapies that modulate monoamine, GABA/Glutamate, neuropeptide and neuroimmune systems. We examine in depth preclinical and clinical evidence of a select range of these compounds and consider their utility in treating AUDs.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Current therapeutic options to treat AUD are inadequate at a population level. Currently there are 30 different compounds and one compound combination in phase I/II clinical trials for AUD. These compounds target various aspects of neurotransmitter signaling, neuroimmune modulation, and alcohol metabolism. Almost 75% of these compounds under trial are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for other indications, which may save time and costs in treatment development. Further, development of therapeutics focused on genetic biomarkers and behavioral screening may improve how treatment decisions are made in the future on a case-by-case basis.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): The development of precision medicine requires advanced technologies to address the multifactorial disease stratification and to support personalized treatments. Among omics techniques, proteomics based on Mass Spectrometry (MS) is becoming increasingly relevant in clinical practice allowing a phenotypic characterization of the dynamic functional status of the organism. From this perspective, Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) MS is a suitable platform for providing a high-throughput support to clinics.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This review aims to provide an updated overview of MALDI-TOF MS applications in clinical proteomics. The most relevant features of this analysis have been discussed, highlighting both pre-analytical and analytical factors that are crucial in proteomics studies. Particular emphasis is placed on biofluids proteomics for biomarkers discovery and on recent progresses in clinical microbiology, drug monitoring, and minimal residual disease (MRD).(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Despite some analytical limitations, the latest technological advances together with the easiness of use, the low time and low cost consuming and the high throughput are making MALDI-TOF MS instruments very attractive for the clinical practice. These features offer a significant potential for the routine of the clinical laboratory and ultimately for personalized medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): IgE-mediated food allergy (FA) has been emerging as a public health priority. It is a potentially life-threatening condition with negative impact on the quality of life of patients and their family and its prevalence is increasing in westernized countries in the recent two decades. The current standard approach to FA consists of the strict avoidance of the triggering food. However, an elimination diet may be difficult and frustrating, above all for those foods (e.g. milk and egg) that are pivotal in the common diet. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) may increase the amount of food that the patient can intake without reaction and reduce the risk of potential life-threatening allergic reactions. It is currently considered the most promising treatment for FA. However, many gaps are still unsolved.(#br)Areas covered(#br): The aim of this review is to shed light on the current evidence and the main needs in OIT in order to stimulate the development of longitudinal, prospective, and well-designed studies with the final goal of a ‘precision medicine.’(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Clinical trials for OIT conducted so far are extremely heterogeneous. The aim in the near future is to identify the most suitable candidates to OIT and algorithms for treatments tailored on well-characterized subpopulations of patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Asthma, a common, non-communicable chronic disease affects over 300 million individuals worldwide. The Western world lifestyle is claimed to be responsible for this high and increasing prevalence. Asthma has been defined as a syndrome with various phenotypes and endotypes, allergic asthma and type 2 asthma being the most frequent. A great increase in prevalence of allergic diseases has necessitated intensive investigations both for understanding the underlying mechanisms and for the development of novel therapy options with long-term efficacy and limited side-effects. Allergic patients demonstrate unique presentations with variable visible characteristics and disease outcomes depending on different molecular mechanisms, related to influence of genes and epigenetic control by micro- and macro-environment.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This article reviews the definition of asthma phenotypes and possible endotypes, advances in allergy-immunology field and contemporary personalized therapy options for asthma.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Better understanding of the complex immune network of allergic inflammation and key players of immunity is continuously being provided for clarification of asthma sub-types. Successful therapy of asthma requires better definition of underlying pathogenesis, which sequentially could end up with ‘custom-tailored’ individualized, evidence-based and more precise therapy options; a new era termed as ‘ precision medicine ’. Endotype, phenotype, theratype and biomarker terms arise as major keywords in precision/personalized medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Finding the optimal treatment regime (or a series of sequential treatment regimes) based on individual characteristics has important applications in areas such as precision medicine, government policies, and active labor market interventions. In the current literature, the optimal treatment regime is usually defined as the one that maximizes the average benefit in the potential population. This article studies a general framework for estimating the quantile-optimal treatment regime, which is of importance in many real-world applications. Given a collection of treatment regimes, we consider robust estimation of the quantile-optimal treatment regime, which does not require the analyst to specify an outcome regression model. We propose an alternative formulation of the estimator as a solution of an optimization problem with an estimated nuisance parameter. This novel representation allows us to investigate the asymptotic theory of the estimated optimal treatment regime using empirical process techniques. We derive theory involving a nonstandard convergence rate and a nonnormal limiting distribution. The same nonstandard convergence rate would also occur if the mean optimality criterion is applied, but this has not been studied. Thus, our results fill an important theoretical gap for a general class of policy search methods in the literature. The article investigates both static and dynamic treatment regimes. In addition, doubly robust estimation and alternative optimality criterion such as that based on Gini’s mean difference or weighted quantiles are investigated. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimator. A data example from a trial in HIV+ patients is used to illustrate the application. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Background(#br): Sub-analyses from the BEST trial in heart failure (HF) indicated that Arg389 homozygote patients may respond to bucindolol. Bucindolol is currently being evaluated in Arg389 genotype patients in the GENETIC-AF trial. Our aim is to conduct ex ante economic evaluations of Arg389 genetic testing to support β-blocker treatment in HF.(#br)Methods(#br): Using survival results from two BEST sub-analyses, we constructed a decision-tree model (time-horizon 18 months, divided into three 6-month cycles) to estimate the cost-effectiveness/utility of Arg389 genetic testing with bucindolol or carvedilol versus no testing and empirical bucindolol. Costs of bucindolol and genetic testing were set conservatively at 1.5x carvedilol cost and $250, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) and cost-utility ratios (ICUR) were estimated.(#br)Results(#br): Per one BEST sub-analysis, Arg389 genetic testing was associated with incremental gains of 0.29 life-years (LYs) and 0.27 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at incremental costs of $726; yielding ICER of US$2,503/LY and ICUR of US$2,688/QALY gained. Per a different BEST sub-analysis, Arg-389 genetic testing was associated with incremental gains of 0.35LYs and 0.32QALYs at savings of (US$1,081); for ICER of (US$3,089)/LY and ICUR of (US$3,378)/QALY gained.(#br)Conclusion(#br)s: Assuming conservative cost estimates, Arg389 genetic testing to inform bucindolol versus carvedilol treatment decisions prevailed economically over bucindolol treatment without genetic testing.]]>

Due to the large heterogeneity in clinical response, debilitating toxicities, and high treatment costs, it is imperative clinicians apply novel methods in precision medicine and cancer genomics to improve the benefit–risk profile.(#br)Areas covered(#br): Cancer genomic medicine provides a personalized and practical method to enrich clinical efficacy, decrease toxicity, and enhance patient quality of life, thereby improving the return on investment for patient. The assimilation of cancer genomic medicine into clinical practice is rapidly advancing. This review addresses several lessons to consider as oncology researchers and clinicians begin to practice precision medicine and cancer genomics, including implications of patient sampling and clinical trials, molecular profiling and therapeutic interventions, and assimilation of cancer genomic medicine into the health system.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): It is important that clinicians and researchers stay abreast of genomic advancements and understand how to effectively incorporate genomics into the cancer care continuum. A concerted and strategic effort must be made by researchers, clinicians, and cancer centers to adopt cancer genomic medicine as part of the new standard of care.]]>

EVs encompass diverse subpopulations differing for biogenesis and content. Among these, microvesicles (MVs) derived from plasma membrane, are key regulators of physiopathological cellular processes including cancer, inflammation and infection. This review is unique in that it focuses specifically on the MVs as a mediator of information transfer. In fact, few proteomic studies have rigorously distinguished MVs from exosomes.(#br)Areas covered(#br): Aim of this review is to discuss the proteomic analyses of the MVs. Many studies have examined mixed populations containing both exosomes and MVs. We discuss MVs’ role in cell-specific interactions. We also show their emerging roles in therapy and diagnosis.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): We see MVs as therapeutic tools for potential use in precision medicine. They may also have potential for allowing the identification of new biomarkers. MVs represent an invaluable tool for studying the cell of origin, which they closely represent, but it is critical to build a repository with data from MVs to deepen our understanding of their molecular repertoire and biological functions.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are chronic, heterogeneous diseases which are generally classified according to clinical presentation. However, the arrival of big data and analytical methods presents an opportunity to better understand these disease entities.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This review article highlights: (1) the potential of a big data approaches with emerging technology to explore the heterogeneity of CVDs; (2) current challenges of a big data approach; and (3) the future of precision cardiovascular medicine.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Overall, most of the current data utilizing big data techniques remain largely descriptive and retrospective. Precision medicine, or N-of-1, approaches have not yet allowed for consistent interpretation since there is no ‘standard’ of how to best apply treatment approaches in a field where evidence-based medicine is based largely on randomized controlled trials. The risk score and biomarker-based approaches have been utilized with some ‘validation’ studies, but more in-depth biomarkers (i.e. pharmacogenomic biomarkers ) have failed to demonstrate incremental benefits. Exploring novel CVD phenotypes by integrating existing medical variables, multi-omics, lifestyle, and environmental data using artificial intelligence is vitally important and may allow us to digitize future clinical trials, potentially leading to novel therapies.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces viral load to under the limit of detection, successfully decreasing HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Due to viral mutations, complex drug combinations and different patient response, there is an increasing demand for individualized treatment options for patients.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This review first summarizes the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of clinical first-line drugs, which serves as guidance for antiretroviral precision medicine. Factors which have influential effects on drug efficacy and thus precision medicine are discussed: patients’ pharmacogenetic information, virus mutations, comorbidities, and immune recovery. Furthermore, strategies to improve the application of precision medicine are discussed.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Precision medicine for ART requires comprehensive information on the drug, virus, and clinical data from the patients. The clinically available genetic tests are a good starting point. To better apply precision medicine, deeper knowledge of drug concentrations, HIV reservoirs, and efficacy associated genes, such as polymorphisms of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes, are required. With advanced computer-based prediction systems which integrate more comprehensive information on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, and the clinically relevant information of the patients, precision medicine will lead to better treatment choices and improved disease outcomes.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) comprises systemic and non-systemic forms of chronic childhood arthritis diagnosed prior to age 16. Significant improvement in treatment outcomes has been witnessed since the introduction of biologics. In particular, advances in research in the area of multidimensional interrogation and network analysis have facilitated understanding of the complex cacophony of components orchestrating disease immunopathogenesis.(#br)Areas covered(#br): In this review, we will examine the scientific advances that have augmented our understanding of JIA pathogenesis, focusing on the progress made in systemic, poly, and oligo JIA in four major aspects: (a) unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms, (b) disease classification, (c) therapeutic selection, and (d) decision for withdrawal of medications after achieving remission.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Dysregulation of innate immune cell physiology and function in sJIA will be highlighted. MicroRNAs contribute to monocyte/macrophage polarization with resulting consequences on macrophage activation syndrome development. The involvement of neutrophils, a major source of S100A8/9/12, in the active inflammatory phase of sJIA is compelling. In non-sJIA, circulating CD4 subsets in T effector and regulatory compartments possessing a strong synovial T-cell receptor coverage and disease activity correlation, acted as an accessible reservoir of pathogenic cells exploitable for clinical management.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Resistant depression is still a common and burdensome issue and there is an urgent need for new and effective adjunctive treatments.(#br)Areas covered(#br): In this paper, the author discusses the background, trial design, results and implications of a recent study (NCT02196506, Sirius study) which confirmed the possible benefit of brexpiprazole as adjunctive treatment in depressed subjects with inadequate benefit from first line treatments. As secondary aims, the study confirmed the effects in subjects with minimal benefit from standard treatments and in subjects with anxious distress. Despite some reported side effects such as akathisia, restlessness, and increased weight, the treatment was well tolerated.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): The unique pharmacodynamic profile of brexpiprazole, in terms of reduced dopamine intrinsic stimulation and a range of other more anxiolytic receptor effects, suggests that brexpiprazole should be preferred in specific subpopulations, particularly where a more sedative profile is needed. Indeed, this study suggests another step in the direction of precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Gene regulation is the term used to describe the mechanisms by which a cell increases or decreases the amount of a gene product (RNA or protein). In complex organs such as the brain, gene regulation is of the utmost importance; aberrations in the regulation of specific genes can lead to neurological disorders. Understanding these mechanisms can create new strategies for targeting these disorders and progress is being made. Two drugs that function at the RNA level (nusinersen and eteplirsen) have now been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Spinomuscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, respectively; several other compounds for neurological disease are currently being investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials.(#br)Areas covered(#br): We highlight how gene regulation at the level of RNA molecules can be used as a therapeutic strategy to treat neurological disorders. We provide examples of how such an approach is being studied or used and discuss the current hurdles.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Targeting gene expression at the RNA level is a promising strategy to treat genetic neurological disorders. Safe administration, long-term efficacy, and potential side effects, however, still need careful evaluation before RNA therapeutics can be applied on a larger scale.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Aims:(#br) Hypertension is the strongest modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affecting 80 million individuals in the US and responsible for ∼360,000 deaths, at total annual costs of $93.5 billion. Antihypertension therapies guided by single genotypes are clinically more effective and may avert more adverse events than the standard of care of layering anti-hypertensive drug therapies, thus potentially decreasing costs. This study aimed to determine the economic benefits of the implementation of multi-gene panel guided therapies for hypertension from the payer perspective within a 3-year time horizon.(#br)Materials and methods:(#br) A simulation analysis was conducted for a panel of 10 million insured patients categorized clinically as untreated, treated but uncontrolled, and treated and controlled over a 3-year treatment period. Inputs included research data; empirical data from a 11-gene panel with known functional, heart, blood vessel, and kidney genotypes; and therapy efficacy and safety estimates from literature. Cost estimates were categorized as related to genetic testing, evaluation and management, medication, or adverse events.(#br)Results:(#br) Multi-gene panel guided therapy yielding savings of $6,256,607,500 for evaluation and management, $908,160,000 for medications, and $37,467,508,716 for adverse events, after accounting for incremental genetic testing costs of $2,355,540,000. This represents total 3-year savings of $42,276,736,216, or a 47% reduction, and 3-year savings of $4,228 and annual savings of $1,409 per covered patient.(#br)Conclusions:(#br) A precision medicine approach to genetically guided therapy for hypertension patients using a multi-gene panel reduced total 3-year costs by 47%, yielding savings exceeding $42.3 billion in an insured panel of 10 million patients. Importantly, 89% of these savings are generated by averting specific adverse events and, thus, optimizing choice of therapy in function of both safety and efficacy.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)With new treatments and novel technology available, precision medicine has become a key topic in the new era of healthcare. Traditional statistical methods for precision medicine focus on subgroup discovery through identifying interactions between a few markers and treatment regimes. However, given the large scale and high dimensionality of modern datasets, it is difficult to detect the interactions between treatment and high-dimensional covariates. Recently, novel approaches have emerged that seek to directly estimate individualized treatment rules (ITR) via maximizing the expected clinical reward by using, for example, support vector machines (SVM) or decision trees. The latter enjoys great popularity in clinical practice due to its interpretability. In this article, we propose a new reward function and a novel decision tree algorithm to directly maximize rewards. We further improve a single tree decision rule by an ensemble decision tree algorithm, ITR random forests. Our final decision rule is an average over single decision trees and it is a soft probability rather than a hard choice. Depending on how strong the treatment recommendation is, physicians can make decisions based on our model along with their own judgment and experience. Performance of ITR forest and tree methods is assessed through simulations along with applications to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1385 patients with diabetes and an EMR cohort of 5177 patients with diabetes. ITR forest and tree methods are implemented using statistical software R ( https://github.com/kdoub5ha/ITR.Forest ). Supplementary materials for this article are available online.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Biomarkers are expected to improve the management of cancer patients by enabling early detection and prediction of therapeutic response. Proteins reflect a molecular phenotype, have high potential as biomarkers, and also are key targets for intervention. Given the ease of collection and proximity to certain tumors, the urinary proteome is a rich source of biomarkers and several proteins have been already implemented.(#br)Areas covered(#br): We examined the literature on urine proteins and proteome analysis in oncology from reports published during the last 5 years to generate an overview on the status of urine protein and peptide biomarkers, with emphasis on their actual clinical value.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): A few studies report on biomarkers that are ready to be implemented in patient management, among others in bladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. These reports are based on multi-marker approaches. A high number of biomarkers, though, has been described in studies with low statistical power. In fact, several of them have been consistently reported across different studies. The latter should be the focus of attention and be tested in properly designed confirmatory and ultimately, prospective investigations. It is expected that multi-marker classifiers for a specific context-of-use, will be the preferred path toward clinical implementation.]]>

The first-in-class drugs now prescribed to CF individuals are not only too expensive but also not as efficacious as hoped despite in-depth in vitro investigation. Therefore, among the current challenges we are facing, are the need of better animal and model systems, novel strategies to discover more potent combinations of drugs to efficiently alleviate CF defects and the need to better classify CF mutations (in particular rare and very rare CFTR mutations) to take into account the multiple defects of the mutated CFTR protein.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Although overall survival rates for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are excellent, the prognosis for certain patients remains suboptimal. Risk-stratification has improved outcomes but 50% of relapses occur in children defined as ‘good risk’ at diagnosis. Precision medicine has the potential to employ novel treatments that will replace more toxic conventional therapy as well as improve outcomes, especially in cancers where response rates remain poor.(#br)Areas covered(#br): A literature search was performed on PubMed using the keywords below. This review describes the history of pediatric ALL treatment from broad risk-based strategies to recent discoveries of targetable lesions that define biological subgroups. This article also describes potentially targetable lesions and pathways associated with drug-resistant relapsed ALL and summarize early results of treatment studies. Finally, targeted immunotherapeutic approaches are discussed.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): The precision medicine approach shows promise for treatment of certain types of de novo and drug-resistant ALL. However, genomic heterogeneity requires each case to have an individualized approach. There are a number of novel agents in the pipeline for lesions previously considered ‘undruggable’ and further refinement and incorporation of targeted treatment into front-line therapy to prevent relapse is an important strategy to improve outcomes for pediatric ALL and will likely become standard of care.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Prognosis remains dismal for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Genomics and proteomics have depicted heterogeneity in PDAC. Collectively, this information could be useful in improving diagnosis, prognosis, modalities of therapy, treatment responses, deciphering drug resistance and new drug development.(#br)Areas covered(#br): We describe major advances in the cellular and molecular subtypes based on next-generation sequencing and their predictive and prognostic value in PDAC patients. We review aberrant genes involving in defined cellular processes in PDAC. Finally, the current state of drug development with novel investigational agents targeting cell fate, cell survival, genomic instability, tumor-stroma, and immune checkpoints are discussed.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Molecular techniques have revealed distinct driver mutations in PDAC. Common genes and cellular processes are dysregulated in the pathogenesis of PDAC. These cellular processes categorized by aberrant pathways include control cell fate, genome maintenance, and cell survival. Dysregulation of the tumor microenvironment promotes an intense fibrosis and immune suppression that play a major role in drug resistance. New information on tumor biology has led to the development of targeted/stromal therapies, immunotherapies or combinations with current chemotherapy in PDAC. New drug development targeting multiple hallmarks of PDAC we hope will positively impact the quality and survival of PDAC patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Precision medicine is currently a topic of great interest in clinical and intervention science. A key component of precision medicine is that it is evidence-based, that is, data-driven, and consequently there has been tremendous interest in estimation of precision medicine strategies using observational or randomized study data. One way to formalize precision medicine is through a treatment regime, which is a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of clinical intervention, that map up-to-date patient information to a recommended treatment. An optimal treatment regime is defined as maximizing the mean of some cumulative clinical outcome if applied to a population of interest. It is well-known that even under simple generative models an optimal treatment regime can be a highly nonlinear function of patient information. Consequently, a focal point of recent methodological research has been the development of flexible models for estimating optimal treatment regimes. However, in many settings, estimation of an optimal treatment regime is an exploratory analysis intended to generate new hypotheses for subsequent research and not to directly dictate treatment to new patients. In such settings, an estimated treatment regime that is interpretable in a domain context may be of greater value than an unintelligible treatment regime built using “black-box” estimation methods. We propose an estimator of an optimal treatment regime composed of a sequence of decision rules, each expressible as a list of “if-then” statements that can be presented as either a paragraph or as a simple flowchart that is immediately interpretable to domain experts. The discreteness of these lists precludes smooth, that is, gradient-based, methods of estimation and leads to nonstandard asymptotics. Nevertheless, we provide a computationally efficient estimation algorithm, prove consistency of the proposed estimator, and derive rates of convergence. We illustrate the proposed methods using a series of simulation examples and application to data from a sequential clinical trial on bipolar disorder. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Over the past decade, the proliferation of genetic studies on human health and disease has reinvigorated debates about the appropriate role of race and ancestry in research and clinical care. Here we report on the responses of genetics professionals to a survey about their views on race, genetics, and ancestry across the domains of science, medicine, and society. Through a qualitative content analysis of free-text comments from 515 survey respondents, we identified key themes pertaining to multiple meanings of race, the use of race as a proxy for genetic ancestry, and the relevance of race and ancestry to health. Our findings suggest that for many genetics professionals the questions of what race is and what race means remain both professionally and personally contentious. Looking ahead as genomics is translated into the practice of precision medicine and as learning health care systems offer continued improvements in care through integrated research, we argue for nuanced considerations of both race and genetic ancestry across research and care settings.]]>

Clinical trials are moving toward an array of studies that are more adapted to precision medicine. In this domain, there is an enhanced need for biomarkers, monitoring devices, and data-analysis methods.

Omes profiles reflect more accurately real-time physiological status.(#br)Personalized omics analyses both disease as a whole and the main disease processes, for a better understanding of the individualized health.

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies (representing 15–40% of fatal TC cases), classified as stage IV by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, regardless of tumor size or presence of lymph node and distant metastases. A large number of genetic alterations are associated with ATC, especially causing dysfunctions in the ERK1/2-MEK1/2 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways (BRAF, p53, RAS, EGFR, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, chromosomal rearrangements, etc). New drugs targeting these molecular pathways have recently been evaluated in ATC.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This article reviews the recent advances in precision medicine for the treatment of ATC.(#br)Expert commentary(#br): Interesting results have been reported with molecules targeting different pathways: 1) BRAF (dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib); 2) angiogenesis (sorafenib, combretastatin, vandetanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib, CLM3, etc); 3) EGFR (gefitinib); 4) PPARγ agonists (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, efatutazone).(#br)The potentiality of targeted drugs to synergize with radiation, chemotherapy, or other targeted drugs is currently under investigation to bypass resistance to a single drug. New affordable individual genomic analyses as well as the possibility to test these new treatments in primary cells from each ATC patient in vitro , could allow the personalization of the therapy, increasing the therapeutic effectiveness and avoiding the use of ineffective drugs.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): In the last decade, the sepsis research field has shifted focus from targeting hyperinflammation to reversing sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. Sepsis-induced immunoparalysis is very heterogeneous: the magnitude and the nature of the underlying immune defects differ considerably between patients, but also within individuals over time. Therefore, a ‘one-treatment-fits-all’ strategy for sepsis-induced immunoparalysis is bound to fail, and an individualized ‘precision medicine’ approach is required. Such a strategy is nevertheless hampered by the unsuitability of the currently available markers to identify the many immune defects that can manifest in individual patients.(#br)Areas covered(#br): We describe the currently available markers for sepsis-induced immunoparalysis and limitations pertaining to their use. Furthermore, future prospects and caveats are discussed, focusing on ‘omics’ approaches: genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics. Finally, we present a contemporary overview of adjuvant immunostimulatory therapies.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): The integration of multiple omics techniques offers a systems biology approach which can yield biomarker profiles that accurately and comprehensively gauge the extent and nature of sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. We expect this development to be instrumental in facilitating precision medicine for sepsis-induced immunoparalysis, consisting of the application of targeted immunostimulatory therapies and follow-up measurements to monitor the response to treatment and to titrate or adjust medication.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Cancer changes the proteome in complex ways that reach well beyond simple changes in protein abundance. Genomic and transcriptional variations and post-translational protein modification create functional variants of a protein, known as proteoforms. Childhood cancers have fewer genomic alterations but show equally dramatic phenotypic changes as malignant cells in adults. Therefore, unraveling the complexities of the proteome is even more important in pediatric malignancies.(#br)Areas covered(#br): In this review, the biological origins of proteoforms and technological advancements in the study of proteoforms are discussed. Particular emphasis is given to their implication in childhood malignancies and the critical role of cancer-specific proteoforms for the next generation of cancer therapies and diagnostics.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Recent advancements in technology have led to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This has been critical for the development of more effective and less harmful treatments that are based on direct targeting of altered proteins and deregulated pathways. As proteome coverage and the ability to detect complex proteoforms increase, the most need for change is in data compilation and database availability to mediate high-level data analysis and allow for better functional annotation of proteoforms.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Within the last decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has resulted in remarkable advances in the field of epilepsy genetics. NGS has become a routine part of the diagnostic workup in many countries. A workup that has led to higher diagnostic yields and insights into the underlying disease mechanisms.(#br)Areas covered(#br): In this review, we report on the recent contributions of NGS testing to the diagnosis and the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, phenotypic variability, and genetic heterogeneity of different epilepsies including developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies, focal and generalized epilepsies. Furthermore, we discuss how the increased knowledge of the genetic architecture of the epilepsies can be translated into more personalized treatment.(#br)Expert opinion/commentary(#br): Targeted gene panels or whole exome sequencing can provide a genetic diagnosis for up to 30% of the patients with early-onset epilepsy. Despite current technical limitations, NGS-based technologies can become the new first-tier diagnostic tests in the epilepsies. As the pool of genetically diagnosed patients has increased, so has the demand for more accurate treatment. Approximately 25% of the epilepsy patients with de novo mutations have genetic diagnoses with potential targets for precision medicine approaches, thus illustrating the enormous utility of genetic testing for therapeutic decision-making.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Personalized diagnostic testing (PDx) is a key component of the precision medicine toolkit and has shown the most development in cancer applications. Recent changes in the regulatory and legal landscapes regarding PDx development and commercialization have brought uncertainties to both intellectual property strategies and business model development. While the regulatory and legal uncertainties have been well-documented, there has been little reported analysis of the recent patent landscape and movement of IP into the PDx market.(#br)Areas covered(#br): This article provides a snapshot landscape analysis of cancer-associated PDx US granted patents from 2014 to 2018, with a focus on claim types, biomarkers, and associated detection strategies, and assignee-specific IP portfolio analyses.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Patent-driven research is commonplace in the legal world for performing patentability, clearance, and validity analyses. The results from this review show that patent-driven analysis is also insightful for understanding strategies to build IP portfolios around biomarker and detection platforms, identifying partners and competitors, and driving PDx technologies into the market. This information is an important source of business intelligence and can provide companies or investors with valuable information for making strategic decisions in developing and commercializing PDx technologies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for premature deaths and a major cost to societies worldwide. Effective blood pressure-lowering drugs are available, but patient adherence to them is low, likely partly due to side effects. To identify patient-specific differences in treatment effects, a repeated cross-over design, where the same treatment contrasts are repeated within each patient, is needed. Such designs have been surprisingly rarely used, given the current focus on precision medicine. The Precision HYpertenSIon Care (PHYSIC) study aims to investigate if there is a consistent between-person variation in blood pressure response to the common blood pressure-lowering drug classes of a clinically relevant magnitude, given the within-person variation in blood pressure. The study will also investigate the between-person variation in side effects of the drugs. In a double-blind, randomized, repeated cross-over trial, 300 patients with mild hypertension will be treated with four blood pressure-lowering drugs (candesartan, lisinopril, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide) in monotherapy, with two of the drugs repeated for each patient. If the study indicates that there is a potential for precision hypertension care, the most promising predictors of blood pressure and side effect response to the drugs will be explored, as will the potential for development of a biomarker panel to rank the suitability of blood pressure-lowering drug classes for individual patients in terms of anticipated blood pressure effects and side effects, with the ultimate goal to maximize adherence. The study follows a protocol pre-registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT02774460.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)In the era towards precision medicine, we here present the individual specific autoantibody signatures of 193 healthy individuals. The self-reactive IgG signatures are stable over time in a way that each individual profile is recognized in longitudinal sampling. The IgG autoantibody reactivity towards an antigen array comprising 335 protein fragments, representing 204 human proteins with potential relevance to autoimmune disorders, was measured in longitudinal plasma samples from 193 healthy individuals. This analysis resulted in unique autoantibody barcodes for each individual that were maintained over one year’s time. The reactivity profiles, or signatures, are person specific in regards to the number of reactivities and antigen specificity. Two independent data sets were consistent in that each healthy individual displayed reactivity towards 0–16 antigens, with a median of six. Subsequently, four selected individuals were profiled on in-house produced high-density protein arrays containing 23,000 protein fragments representing 14,000 unique protein coding genes. Based on a unique, broad and deep longitudinal profiling of autoantibody reactivities, our results demonstrate a unique autoreactive profile in each analyzed healthy individual. The need and interest for broad-ranged and high-resolution molecular profiling of healthy individuals is rising. We have here generated and assessed an initial perspective on the global distribution of the self-reactive IgG repertoire in healthy individuals, by investigating 193 well-characterized healthy individuals. Highlights(#br) A unique longitudinal profiling of autoantibody repertoires in healthy individuals(#br) Autoantibody profiles are highly individual and stable over time(#br) All individuals display IgG binding to human protein fragments(#br) The specificity of disease associated autoantigens needs to be thoroughly characterized(#br) The identification of a small set of highly reactive autoantigens(#br) Importance of stringent antigen and sample specific cut-offs for defining reactivity(#br)]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): The success of binding site comparisons in drug discovery is based on the recognized fact that many different proteins have similar binding sites. Indeed, binding site comparisons have found many uses in drug development and have the potential to dramatically cut the cost and shorten the time necessary for the development of new drugs.(#br)Areas covered(#br): The authors review recent methods for comparing protein binding sites and their use in drug repurposing and polypharmacology. They examine emerging fields including the use of binding site comparisons in precision medicine, the prediction of structured water molecules, the search for targets of natural compounds, and their application in the development of protein-based drugs by loop modeling and for comparison of RNA binding sites.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): Binding site comparisons have produced many interesting results in drug development, but relatively little work has been done on protein–protein interaction sites, which are particularly relevant in view of the success of biological drugs. Growth of protein loop modeling for modulating biological drugs is anticipated. The fusion of currently distinct methods for the comparison of RNA and protein binding sites into a single comprehensive approach could allow the search for new selective ribosomal antibiotics and initiate pharmaceutical research into other nucleoproteins.]]>

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Identifying patient-specific prognostic biomarkers is of critical importance in developing personalized treatment for clinically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases such as cancer. In this article, we propose a novel regression framework, Bayesian hierarchical varying-sparsity regression (BEHAVIOR) models to select clinically relevant disease markers by integrating proteogenomic (proteomic+genomic) and clinical data. Our methods allow flexible modeling of protein–gene relationships as well as induces sparsity in both protein–gene and protein–survival relationships, to select genomically driven prognostic protein markers at the patient-level. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of BEHAVIOR against competing method in terms of both protein marker selection and survival prediction. We apply BEHAVIOR to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) proteogenomic pan-cancer data and find several interesting prognostic proteins and pathways that are shared across multiple cancers and some that exclusively pertain to specific cancers.

          <![CDATA[ABSTRACT(#br)Introduction(#br): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition, which presents the opportunity for precision therapy based on genetics or other biomarkers.(#br)Areas covered(#br): Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic form of emphysema, provides an example of this precision approach to diagnosis and therapy. To date, research in COPD pharmacogenomics has been limited by small sample sizes, lack of accessible target tissue, failure to consider COPD subtypes, and different outcomes relevant for various medications. There have been several published genome-wide association studies and other omics studies in COPD pharmacogenomics; however, clinical implementation remains far away. There is a growing evidence base for precision prescription of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, based on clinical phenotypes and blood biomarkers, but not yet based on pharmacogenomics.(#br)Expert opinion(#br): At this time, there is insufficient evidence for clinical implementation of COPD pharmacogenomics. Additional genome-wide studies will be required to discover predictors of drug response and to identify genomic biomarkers of COPD subtypes, which could be targeted with subtype-directed therapies.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Objectives:(#br) Cancer is one of the main cause of death in Western countries. Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Nicotinamide (NA) – known for its anti-inflammatory properties – participates in the processes related to the cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, which are relevant in cancer development. This study aimed to investigate the nicotinamide metabolism alterations in bladder cancer.(#br)Methods:(#br) Blood and plasma samples of patients with bladder cancer were collected. Blood pyridine and adenine nucleotides concentration were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma nicotinamide metabolites concentration were determined using high performance liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC/MS).(#br)Results:(#br) Our results indicated that the development of bladder cancer caused significant decrease in the concentration of N-methylnicotinamide (MetNA) (0.07 ± 0.02 vs 0.1 ± 0.03 µmol/l) and an increase in the concentration of N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (Met2PY) – one of the final nicotinamide metabolites: (1.1 ± 0.15 vs 0.7 ± 0.07 µmol/l) in comparison to the control. The association between the stage of cancer and the increase in both, Met2PY and Met4PY levels was observed. Blood ATP and NAD levels were significantly decreased in bladder cancer patients as compared to the control (970.8 ± 77.84 vs 1165.00 ± 57.76 µmol/l; 45.86 ± 2.98 vs 53.06 ± 2.28 µmol/l respectively).(#br)Conclusions:(#br) Bladder cancer development caused substantial changes in nicotinamide metabolism, such as decreased plasma MetNA and increased Met2PY concentration. Analysis of the nicotinamide and its metabolites concentrations – as new biomarkers – may allow to track the course of pathological processes in cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Purpose of Review(#br)Although significant progress has been made in cancer research, there exist unmet needs in patient care as reflected by the “Cancer Moonshot” goals. This review appreciates the potential utility of quantitative pharmacology in cancer precision medicine.(#br) Recent Findings(#br)Precision oncology has received federal funding largely due to “The Precision Medicine Initiative.” Precision medicine takes into account the inter-individual variability and allows for tailoring the right medication or the right dose of drug to the best subpopulation of patients who will likely respond to the intervention, thus enhancing therapeutic success and reducing “financial toxicity” to patients, families, and caregivers. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) committed US$70 million from its fiscal year 2016 budget to advance precision oncology research. Through the “Critical Path Initiative,” pharmacometrics has gained an important role in drug development; however, it is yet to find widespread clinical applicability.(#br) Summary(#br)Stakeholders including clinicians and pharmacometricians need to work in concert to ensure that benefits of model-based approaches are harnessed to personalize cancer care to the individual needs of the patient via better dosing strategies, companion diagnostics, and predictive biomarkers. In medical oncology, where immediate patient care is the clinician’s primary concern, pharmacometric approaches can be tailored to build models that rely on patient data already digitally available in the electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate quick collaboration and avoid additional funding needs. Taken together, we offer a roadmap for the future of precision oncology which is fraught with both challenges and opportunities for pharmacometricians and clinicians alike.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Alcohol use disorder is a complex syndrome with multiple treatment points including drug-induced pathology, withdrawal management, behavioral/cognitive strategies, and relapse prevention. These different components may be complicated by genotype and phenotype. A huge milestone for the treatment of alcohol use disorder across several countries in the last 10 years was the introduction of practice guidelines integrating clinical expertise and research evidence. These provide a summary of interventions that have been shown to be effective following rigorous and replicated clinical trials. Inspection of these guidelines reveals good consistency, but little evidence of progress in treatment approaches for alcohol use disorder over the past decade. In this mini-review, we discuss emerging treatments for alcohol use disorder that may supplement or improve the evidence-based treatments that are currently recommended. New medications, the emergence of digital technology, and other novel approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation are all discussed with reference to treatments already in practice. We also consider how individual differences in genotype and phenotype may affect outcomes. Together with improvements in technology, this knowledge offers a powerful tool for designing personalized approaches to treatment, and hence improving prognosis for rehabilitation programs.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Purpose of Review(#br)Cancer therapy is increasingly becoming dependent on the ability to target specific molecular pathways that drive disease progression. Consequently, the identification of specific molecular pathways requires the use of companion diagnostic assays that are accurate and reproducible. This review will discuss the data and concerns surrounding pre-analytic variables in the evaluation of breast cancer tissue.(#br) Recent Findings(#br)Although ASCO/CAP guidelines offer recommendations for the collection and preservation of diagnostic clinical tissues, standard clinical practice has paid little attention to the suitability of these tissues for further molecular analysis. Current research suggests that alterations in the molecular integrity of tissue during the pre-analytic stage may result in inaccurate results and potentially sub-standard patient care.(#br) Summary(#br)Threshold recommendations for optimal molecular analyses associated with pre-analytic variables are limited. Future recommendations regarding pre-analytic variables and molecular diagnostics of breast cancer tissue will require additional research on the effects of pre-fixation, fixation, processing, and storage on nucleic acid integrity, comparing fixed material with fresh and/or frozen controls.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Background(#br)Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers among women worldwide, characterized by diverse biological heterogeneity. It is well known that complex and combined gene regulation of multi-omics is involved in the occurrence and development of breast cancer.(#br) Results(#br)In this paper, we present the Multi-Omics Breast Cancer Database (MOBCdb), a simple and easily accessible repository that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, clinical, and drug response data of different subtypes of breast cancer. MOBCdb allows users to retrieve simple nucleotide variation (SNV), gene expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and specific drug response data by various search fashions. The genome-wide browser /navigation facility in MOBCdb provides an interface for visualizing multi-omics data of multi-samples simultaneously. Furthermore, the survival module provides survival analysis for all or some of the samples by using data of three omics. The approved public drugs with genetic variations on breast cancer are also included in MOBCdb.(#br) Conclusion(#br) In summary, MOBCdb provides users a unique web interface to the integrated multi-omics data of different subtypes of breast cancer, which enables the users to identify potential novel biomarkers for precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Since Garrod’s first description of alkaptonuria in 1902, and newborn screening for phenylketonuria introduced in the 1960s, P4 medicine (preventive, predictive, personalized, and participatory) has been a reality for the clinician serving patients with inherited metabolic diseases. The era of high-throughput technologies promises to accelerate its scale dramatically. Genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, glycomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics offer an amazing opportunity for holistic investigation and contextual pathophysiologic understanding of inherited metabolic diseases for precise diagnosis and tailored treatment. While each of the -omics technologies is important to systems biology, some are more mature than others. Exome sequencing is emerging as a reimbursed test in clinics around the world, and untargeted metabolomics has the potential to serve as a single biochemical testing platform. The challenge lies in the integration and cautious interpretation of these big data, with translation into clinically meaningful information and/or action for our patients. A daunting but exciting task for the clinician; we provide clinical cases to illustrate the importance of his/her role as the connector between physicians, laboratory experts and researchers in the basic, computer, and clinical sciences. Open collaborations, data sharing, functional assays, and model organisms play a key role in the validation of -omics discoveries. Having all the right expertise at the table when discussing the diagnostic approach and individualized management plan according to the information yielded by -omics investigations (e.g., actionable mutations, novel therapeutic interventions), is the stepping stone of P4 medicine. Patient participation and the adjustment of the medical team’s plan to his/her and the family’s wishes most certainly is the capstone. Are you ready?]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Purpose of Review(#br)Epilepsy is among the most common neurological diseases, affecting 65 million people worldwide. Recent revisions to the classification of epilepsies by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) reflect a growing awareness of genetic contributions to epilepsy. Research in epilepsy genetics has begun to look beyond gene discovery to the horizon of genotype-driven precision medicine.(#br) Recent Findings(#br)During the past 5 years, the advent of next-generation sequencing has led to exponential growth in the discovery of epilepsy-related genes. The yield of clinically available genetic tests for patients with epilepsy may be as high as 50%, particularly among patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE). Among patients with early-life epilepsies who have a genetic diagnosis, de novo pathogenic variants are most frequently observed, and rates of somatic mosaicism among both patients and parents are higher than initially anticipated. Phenotypic heterogeneity is quite broad for many epilepsy-related genes, and genotype-phenotype correlations continue to prove complex and at times challenging.(#br) Summary(#br)With a focus on early-life epilepsies, we review recent highlights from the literature regarding gene discovery, approaches to and outcomes of clinical genetic evaluation, and contemporary efforts toward precision treatment. We also address genetic counseling issues of relevance for this population.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Purpose of Review(#br)Cancer is often a complicated and dynamic disease, which makes determining the optimal treatment for a given patient a difficult endeavor. Moreover, even within a particular cancer type, different patients often have varying responses to the same therapies. Bioengineered tumor model systems specific to patients would allow preemptive screening of personalized therapies, facilitating identification of the most effective treatments prior to administration in the patients. Here, we provide an overview of organoid technology, and how these bioengineered tumor models can be harnessed for patient-centric personalized oncology.(#br) Recent Findings(#br)Organoid models have ranged from simple cell spheroids to more complex tumor-on-a-chip systems. The earliest of these models were comprised of easy to culture cell lines, but recent advances in 3D cell culture approaches have facilitated generation of human primary cell-based organoids. Importantly, recent efforts have been made to employ tumor biospecimens from human patients to create personalized tumor models for patient-specific predictive drug screening.(#br) Summary(#br)Bioengineering and tissue engineering technologies have advanced significantly in recent years, culminating in the capability to biofabricate tissue and tumor organoids derived from individual human patients. In the near future, we anticipate such models being implemented in parallel with clinical practice as patient-oriented screening tools, thereby improving the success rates of oncology.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)As genetics and genomics become part of mainstream medicine, these advances have the potential to either reduce or exacerbate health disparities. Relatively, little research has explored the quality of genetic counseling communication experienced by limited English proficiency patients, especially Chinese Americans. We observed and audio recorded genetic counseling appointments ( n = 40) of low-income, limited English-proficient Chinese patients ( n = 25) and conducted post-visit interviews ( n = 17) using stimulated recall to examine patient understanding of the communication. Standard techniques based in grounded theory, including iterative data review and multiple coders, were used to analyze observation fieldnotes and interview transcripts and to identify these themes: (1) strong beliefs in environmental causes of cancer and skepticism about genetic causes, (2) willingness to undergo genetic testing despite skepticism of hereditary cause of cancer, (3) misunderstanding of key information needed to make informed decisions about testing and screening/prevention options, (4) variable quality of medical interpretation, and (5) selective family communication about cancer and genetic counseling and testing. Together, these themes describe substantial gaps in communication and identify the need for genetic counseling techniques and skills that enable counselors to communicate more effectively across language, literacy, and culture. Understanding the mechanisms of inheritance and the implications of genetic test results can be challenging for anyone, and it is exceptionally daunting for those who have limited English proficiency and/or low literacy. For Chinese immigrant patients to reap the full benefits of genetic counseling and testing, effective communication is essential. Research on interventions to improve communication is needed to ensure that disparities do not widen as genomic medicine reaches a more diverse population.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This study aimed to identify predictors of adverse psychological experiences among direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic test consumers. We performed a secondary analysis on data from the Scripps Genomic Health Initiative (SGHI), which studied 2037 individuals tested with commercially available tests yielding personalized risk estimates for 23 common, genetically complex diseases. As part of the original study, the participants completed baseline and follow-up survey measures assessing demographics, personal and family health history, attitudes toward genetic testing, anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)), test-related distress (Impact of Event Scale—Revised (IES-R)), and reactions to receipt of results. To further describe the participants who had an adverse psychological outcome, this secondary analysis defined two different variables (“distress response” and “psychologically sensitive participants”) and examined their relationship to various demographic variables and other survey responses. One hundred thirty participants (6.4%) were defined as having a “distress response” to receipt of results based on changes in STAI and/or IES. Four hundred thirty-one participants (21.2%) were defined as being “psychologically sensitive” based on high STAI scores both pre- and post-receipt of results. For psychologically sensitive subjects, younger age emerged as a predictor ( p < 0.0005). Family history and personal history were only significant predictors for Alzheimer’s disease in the psychologically sensitive participants ( p = .03) and restless leg syndrome in those with a distress response ( p = .03). Psychologically sensitive participants were more likely to indicate a number of pre-test concerns than were controls, but neither group of participants were any more likely to follow up with their physician or a free genetic counseling service after the return of results.]]>

          <![CDATA[Opinion statement(#br)The discovery of genomic alterations that drive the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has transformed how we treat metastatic disease. However, the promise of precision medicine remains elusive for the most commonly mutated oncogene in NSCLC, KRAS . This is perhaps due to the substantial heterogeneity within the broader genomic context of KRAS -mutant NSCLC. At this time, approaches for treating metastatic KRAS -mutant NSCLC mirror those for treating NSCLC that lacks a known driver mutation, including standard chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic approaches. Ongoing research aims to define further subgroups of KRAS -mutant NSCLC based on mutation subtype and co-occurring mutations. These efforts offer the potential to optimize standard-of-care regimens within these emerging subgroups and harness innovative strategies to realize precision medicine in this setting.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Current problems and some future perspectives of molecular genetic study of connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are reviewed. The corresponding clinical manifestation and mode of heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) inheritance are subdivided into inherited, mostly monogenic, forms and mixed or multifactorial dysplasia of connective tissue (MDCTs). Both forms, especially MDCT, pose significant problems for precise clinical diagnostics. Implementation of modern DNA technologies includes new generation sequencing and clinical exome sequencing which provided a substantial impact in understanding the complex molecular genetic background of CTDs. Owing to new technologies, hundreds of new causative genes of CTDs were found and many commercial gene panels were designed for more precise and objective diagnostics of different CTDs. The results of implementation of NGS for analysis of both HDCTs and especially MDCTs complicated with common syntropic diseases as well as some new data on epigenetic causes of CTDs are briefly summarized. Special attention is paid to biological models and cell culture technologies complemented results of NGS in CTDs. Obvious advantages, relevant problems, and definite limitations in clinical implication of NGS for CTDs studies are discussed.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Background(#br)Over the last 15 years, an estimated 3000 large centralized biobanks have been established worldwide, making important contributions to the further development of precision medicine.

Success stories, where bioprobes have contributed to the further development of precision medicine, are shown in this paper using among others the example of RET gene fusion discovery in lung cancer. Interestingly enough, many key publications in the field of precision medicine do not contain exact references to the biobanks involved.(#br) Conclusions(#br)The importance of centralized biobanks in translational research and clinical development is constantly increasing. However, in order to ensure the acceptance and visibility of biobanks, their participation in success stories of biomedical progress must be systematically documented and published.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Purpose(#br)The diffusion of genomic testing is critical to the success of precision medicine, but there is limited information on oncologists’ uptake of genetic technology. We aimed to assess the frequency with which medical oncologists and surgeons order BRCA 1 / 2 and Oncotype DX testing for breast cancer patients.(#br) Methods(#br)We surveyed 732 oncologists and surgeons treating breast cancer patients. Physicians were from Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and were listed in the 2010 AMA Masterfile or identified by patients.(#br) Results(#br)80.6% of providers ordered BRCA 1 / 2 testing at least sometimes and 85.4% ordered Oncotype DX ( p = 0.01). More frequent ordering of BRCA 1 / 2 was associated with more positive attitudes toward genetic innovation (OR 1.14, p = 0.001), a belief that testing was likely to be covered by patients’ insurance (OR 2.84, p < 0.001), and more frequent ordering of Oncotype DX testing (OR 8.69, p < 0.001). More frequent use of Oncotype DX was associated with a belief that testing was likely to be covered by insurance (OR 7.33, p < 0.001), as well as with more frequent ordering of BRCA 1 / 2 testing (OR 9.48, p < 0.001).(#br) Conclusions(#br)Nearly one in five providers never or rarely ever ordered BRCA 1 / 2 testing for their breast cancer patients, and nearly 15% never or rarely ever ordered Oncotype DX. Less frequent ordering of BRCA 1 / 2 is associated with less frequent use of Oncotype DX testing, and vice versa. Those who do not order BRCA 1 / 2 testing report less positive attitudes toward genetic innovation. Further education of this subset of providers regarding the benefits of precision medicine may enable more rapid diffusion of genetic technology.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) present an important clinical challenge in both surgical and medical oncology. Despite improvements in management, survival among patients undergoing resection of CRLM is still very variable and there is a paucity of clinical trial data and reliable biomarkers that could guide prognostic forecasts, treatment selection, and follow-up. Fortunately, recent advances in molecular biology and tumor sequencing have identified a number of critical genetic loci and proliferation markers that may hold the key to understanding the biologic behavior of CRLM; specifically, mutations of KRAS, BRAF, TP53, PIK3CA, APC, expression of Ki-67, and the presence of microsatellite instability appear to have a decisive impact on prognosis and response to treatment in patients with CRLM. While the applicability of genetic biomarkers in everyday clinical practice remains conditional on the development of inexpensive bedside sequencing, targeted therapies, and the conduct of appropriate clinical trials, the promise of personalized treatment may be closer to realization than ever before.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Drug-induced diabetes is widely reported in clinical conditions, and it is becoming a global issue because of its potential to increase the risk of severe cardiovascular complications. However, which drug mechanisms exert their diabetogenic effects and why the effects present significant inter-individual differences remain largely unknown. Pharmacogenomics, which is the study of how genomic variation influences drug responses, provides an explanation for individual differences in drug-induced diabetes. We highlight that pharmacogenomics can be involved in regulating the expression of genes in signaling pathways related to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drugs or the pathogenesis of diabetes, contributing to the differences in drug-induced glucose impairment. The pharmacogenomics studies of the major diabetogenic drugs are reviewed, including calcineurin inhibitors, antipsychotics, hormones, and antihypertensive drugs. We intend to elucidate the genetic basis of drug-induced diabetes and pave the way for the precise use of these drugs in the clinic.]]>

This genetic variability is probably related to the extreme heterogeneity of disease manifestation. Important findings have associated mutations of Lamin A/C (LMNA) and Filamin C (FLNC) to poor prognosis and the propensity to cause an arrhythmic phenotype, respectively. However, a deeper understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation is necessary, because it could have several implications for the clinical management of the patients. Furthermore, the correct interpretation of pathogenicity of mutations and the clinical impact of genetic testing in DCM patients still represent important fields to be implemented.(#br) Summary(#br)A pathogenic gene mutation can be identified in almost 40% of DCM patients.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Technological breakthroughs in genomics have had a significant impact on clinical therapy for human diseases, allowing us to use patient genetic differences to guide medical care. The “synthetic lethal approach” leverages on cancer-specific genetic rewiring to deliver a therapeutic regimen that preferentially targets malignant cells while sparing normal cells. The utility of this system is evident in several recent studies, particularly in poor prognosis cancers with loss-of-function mutations that become “treatable” when two otherwise discrete and unrelated genes are targeted simultaneously. This review focuses on the chemotherapeutic targeting of epigenetic alterations in cancer cells and consolidates a network that outlines the interplay between epigenetic and genetic regulators in DNA damage repair. This network consists of numerous synergistically acting relationships that are druggable, even in recalcitrant triple-negative breast cancer. This collective knowledge points to the dawn of a new era of personalized medicine.]]>

Overall, RT-related features, such as the planning target volume and total dose, had preeminent importance for prognostic performance. Therapy response features were selected for prediction of disease progression.(#br) Conclusions(#br)A machine learning-based prognostic model combining known prognostic factors with treatment- and response-related information showed high accuracy for individualized risk assessment.

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Massive amounts of data are collected and stored on a routine basis in virtually all domains of human activities. Such data are potentially useful to biomedicine. Yet, access to data for research purposes is hindered by the fact that different kinds of individual-patient data reside in disparate, unlinked silos. We propose that data cooperatives can promote much needed data aggregation and consequently accelerate research and its clinical translation. Data cooperatives enable direct control over personal data, as well as more democratic governance of data pools. This model can realize a specific kind of data economy whereby citizens and communities are empowered to steer data use according to their motivations, preferences, and concerns. Policy makers can promote this model by recognizing citizens’ rights to access and to obtain a copy of their own data, and by funding distributed data infrastructures piloting new data aggregation models.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the corticomotorneuronal network responsible for voluntary movement. There are well-established clinical, genetic and pathological overlaps between ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which together constitute the ‘TDP-43 proteinopathies’. An ever-expanding list of genes in which mutation leads to typical ALS have implicated abnormalities in RNA processing, protein homoeostasis and axonal transport. How these apparently distinct pathways converge to cause the characteristic clinical syndrome of ALS remains unclear. Although there are major gaps in our understanding of the essential nature of ALS pathophysiology, the identification of genetic causes in up to 15% of ALS patients, coupled with advances in biotechnology and biomarker research provide a foundation for approaches to treatment based on ‘precision medicine’, and even prevention of the disease in pre-symptomatic mutation carriers in the future. Currently, multidisciplinary care remains the bedrock of management and this is increasingly being put onto an evidence-based footing.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Purpose of Review(#br)The success of precision medicine relies heavily on biomarkers. Validated biomarkers that help stratify risk and guide treatments in patients with colorectal cancers are limited. With advances in genomics, immune landscapes and technological assays, there are increasing numbers of biomarkers that show potential to guide treatment decisions in the clinic. In this article, we review the key emerging biomarkers including tissue-based gene-based expression biomarkers, microRNA and immune signatures along with circulating tumour DNA in plasma, biomarkers of anti-angiogenic agents.(#br) Recent Findings(#br)Mismatch repair proteins have emerged as predictive biomarkers of immune-oncology agents. Lack of caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) expression has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker identifying a subgroup of patients with high-risk stage 2 colon cancer who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. A validated biomarker, Immunoscore, has been proposed as an adjunct to the conventional TNM classification to help with prognostication. Circulating tumour DNA has the potential to be a prognostic and predictive biomarker in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and by identifying minimal residual disease in stage 2 and 3 colorectal cancer, it can be useful to detect early relapse.(#br) Summary(#br)Biomarker discovery and validation has its own challenges, but to truly deliver precision medicine to our patients, it is crucial to understand and address key research gaps.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Background(#br)The “Era of Big Data” and “Precision Medicine” is now upon us. That is, interrogation of large data sets obtained from groups of similar patients or from the patient themselves over time will now hypothetically permit therapies to be designed to provide maximal efficacy with minimal side effects. However, such discoveries depend upon recruitment of very large numbers of subjects (tens of thousands) along with their associated biospecimens and medical records. When considering the establishment of a biobank or the refocusing of an existing repository for the purpose of “omics” research (i.e., genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, microbiomics, etc.) and/or precision medicine, there are a number of considerations to ponder. Each of these facets is discussed.(#br) Objective(#br)The objective of this review is to describe best practices for the establishment and operations of a biobank that will be used for omics (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiomics) analyses based on published literature and our own practical experiences.(#br) Methods(#br)We describe the most commonly described approaches to a variety of biobanking issues, including our own practical experiences over the past 5 years.(#br) Results(#br)Based on the particular biobanking situation and downstream application, we have described best practices based on the literature and own experience, taking into consideration ease of application and costs.(#br) Conclusions(#br)The banking of various types of clinical biospecimens has many valuable uses but often depends on overall costs versus sample utility. In addition, specimen flexibility is important but is influenced by the ease or difficulty of the application. It is always preferable to collect and stored a biospecimen in a format that allows for multiple types of downstream analyses, but that often requires additional expertise, equipment and reagents that can increase overall costs. We have described the methodologies most successfully applied to many situations.]]>

          <![CDATA[Summary(#br)In 2008 the Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology (LBC ONC) was established on the basis of two previous Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes working in the field of hematology and cancer research. The general aim of the LBC ONC is to improve treatment of hematopoietic neoplasms by eradicating cancer-initiating and disease-propagating cells, also known as leukemic stem cells (LSC) in the context of leukemia. In a first phase, the LBC ONC characterized the phenotype and molecular aberration profiles of LSC in various malignancies. The LSC phenotypes were established in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, the concept of preleukemic (premalignant) neoplastic stem cells (pre-L-NSC) was coined by the LBC ONC and was tested in myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Phenotypic characterization of LSC provided a solid basis for their purification and for the characterization of specific target expression profiles. In a second phase, molecular markers and targets were validated. This second phase is ongoing and should result in the development of new diagnostics parameters and novel, more effective, LSC-eradicating, treatment strategies; however, many issues still remain to be solved, such as sub-clonal evolution, LSC niche interactions, immunologic control of LSC, and LSC resistance. In the forthcoming years, the LBC ONC will concentrate on developing LSC-eradicating strategies, with special focus on LSC resistance, precision medicine and translation of LSC-eradicating concepts into clinical application.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)With the advent of widespread genomic testing for diagnostic indications and disease risk assessment, there is increased need to optimize genetic counseling services to support the scalable delivery of precision medicine. Here, we describe how we operationalized the reciprocal engagement model of genetic counseling practice to develop a framework of counseling components and strategies for the delivery of genomic results. This framework was constructed based upon qualitative research with patients receiving genomic counseling following online receipt of potentially actionable complex disease and pharmacogenomics reports. Consultation with a transdisciplinary group of investigators, including practicing genetic counselors, was sought to ensure broad scope and applicability of these strategies for use with any large-scale genomic testing effort. We preserve the provision of pre-test education and informed consent as established in Mendelian/single-gene disease genetic counseling practice. Following receipt of genomic results, patients are afforded the opportunity to tailor the counseling agenda by selecting the specific test results they wish to discuss, specifying questions for discussion, and indicating their preference for counseling modality. The genetic counselor uses these patient preferences to set the genomic counseling session and to personalize result communication and risk reduction recommendations. Tailored visual aids and result summary reports divide areas of risk (genetic variant, family history, lifestyle) for each disease to facilitate discussion of multiple disease risks. Post-counseling, session summary reports are actively routed to both the patient and their physician team to encourage review and follow-up. Given the breadth of genomic information potentially resulting from genomic testing, this framework is put forth as a starting point to meet the need for scalable genetic counseling services in the delivery of precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br) Purpose of Review(#br)The Friedewald equation for estimation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was published in 1972 as an alternative to direct assessment by preparative ultracentrifugation. In this equation, very low-density lipoprotein is estimated by dividing triglycerides by a fixed factor (5 in mg/dL or 2.2 in mmol/L) and subtracting this term from non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). This method was derived in fasting samples from a small cohort of patients with primarily genetic dyslipidemias followed at the NIH. The method served well as the global standard for LDL-C estimation for decades, but is not well suited to modern clinical practice because it tends to underestimate LDL-C at low LDL-C and high triglyceride levels. The concern is that underestimation could lead to undertreatment in high-risk patients.(#br) Recent Findings(#br)Derived from big data and now validated around the world, a novel LDL-C equation created at Johns Hopkins replaces the fixed factor seen in the classic equation with a patient-specific variable based on triglyceride and non-HDL-C levels.(#br) Summary(#br)Given its superior accuracy in fasting and non-fasting populations alike, the novel equation is now the preferred method for LDL-C estimation and is being incorporated by leading clinical laboratories.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Combination therapy is increasingly becoming the cornerstone of current day antitumor therapy. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive brain tumor with a dismal median survival post diagnosis and a high rate of disease recurrence. The poor prognosis can be attributed to unique treatment limitations, which include the infiltrative nature of tumor cells, failure of anti-glioma drugs to cross the blood–brain barrier, tumor heterogeneity and the highly metastatic and angiogenic nature of the tumor making cells resistant to chemotherapy. Combination therapy approach is being developed against glioblastoma with new innovative combination drug regimens being tested in preclinical and clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of glioblastoma, diagnostic markers, therapeutic targeting strategies, current treatment limitations, novel combination therapies in the context of current treatment options and the ongoing clinical trials for glioblastoma therapy.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)This Strategic Research Agenda identifies current challenges and needs in healthcare, illustrates how biomedical imaging and derived data can help to address these, and aims to stimulate dedicated research funding efforts.(#br)Medicine is currently moving towards a more tailored, patient-centric approach by providing personalised solutions for the individual patient. Innovation in biomedical imaging plays a key role in this process as it addresses the current needs for individualised prevention, treatment, therapy response monitoring, and image-guided surgery.(#br)The use of non-invasive biomarkers facilitates better therapy prediction and monitoring, leading to improved patient outcomes. Innovative diagnostic imaging technologies provide information about disease characteristics which, coupled with biological, genetic and -omics data, will contribute to an individualised diagnosis and therapy approach.(#br)In the emerging field of theranostics, imaging tools together with therapeutic agents enable the selection of best treatments and allow tailored therapeutic interventions.(#br)For prenatal monitoring, the use of innovative imaging technologies can ensure an early detection of malfunctions or disease.(#br)The application of biomedical imaging for diagnosis and management of lifestyle-induced diseases will help to avoid disease development through lifestyle changes.(#br)Artificial intelligence and machine learning in imaging will facilitate the improvement of image interpretation and lead to better disease prediction and therapy planning.(#br)As biomedical imaging technologies and analysis of existing imaging data provide solutions to current challenges and needs in healthcare, appropriate funding for dedicated research is needed to implement the innovative approaches for the wellbeing of citizens and patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract(#br)Patients are typically debriefed by their healthcare provider after any medical procedure or surgery to discuss their findings and any next steps involving medication or treatment instructions. However, without any medical or scientific background knowledge, it can feel overwhelming and esoteric for a patient to listen to a physician describe a complex operation. Instead, providing patients with engaging visuals and a virtual reality (VR) simulation of their individual clinical findings could lead to more effective transfer of medical knowledge and comprehension of treatment information. A newly developed VR technology is described, called HealthVoyager, which is designed to help facilitate this knowledge transfer between physicians and patients. The platform represents a customizable, VR software system utilizing a smartphone or tablet computer to portray personalized surgical or procedural findings as well as representations of normal anatomy. The use of such technology for eliciting medical understanding and patient satisfaction can have many practical and clinical applications for a variety of disease states and patient populations.]]>

          <![CDATA[人PDZ和LIM域蛋白1(PDZ and LIM domain protein 1, PDLIM1)是PDZ-LIM蛋白家族的成员之一,参与多种生物学过程,包括细胞骨架组织和肿瘤发生。PDLIM1通过PDZ结构域结合相关蛋白质(如辅肌动蛋白α-actinin)以及通过LIM结构域与相关激酶(如clik1)结合,并定位到肌动蛋白应力纤维,进而参与细胞骨架调控。细胞骨架具有维持细胞形态的功能,在细胞运动中起着关键作用。肿瘤细胞的浸润与转移常表现为细胞运动能力的改变,这个改变过程往往涉及到细胞骨架在时空上的动态重组,而重组的时空调控由关键的细胞信号通路介导。因此,进一步研究PDLIM1在肿瘤浸润与转移过程中的信号调控机制,可能发现潜在的治疗靶点和预后因子,有助于在精准医疗时代进行更好的个性化肿瘤防治。]]>

          <![CDATA[目的:探讨HOPX基因在宫颈癌组织和血清中的表达水平及其对宫颈癌HeLa细胞的作用及其机制,并分析其与肿瘤标志物CEA和CA125表达的相关性。方法:选取2015年6月至2017年12月天津市滨海人民医院和武清区人民医院50例宫颈癌患者癌组织、癌旁组织和外周血清样本,同时取50例正常人的血清样本。qRT-PCR检测宫颈癌组织和血清中HOPX的表达水平,免疫组化染色检测宫颈癌患者血清中HOPX蛋白的表达,通过NCBI-GEO和TCGA数据库收集宫颈癌癌组织标本和患者预后的相关数据,分析HOPX基因在宫颈癌组织中的表达水平及其与患者预后的相关性。过表达的HOPX和对照的质粒转染HeLa细胞后,MTT和克隆形成实验检测转染的HeLa细胞的增殖能力,Transwell实验检测HeLa细胞迁移和侵袭能力,Western blotting检测其EMT相关蛋白的表达。结果:标本检测和数据库分析均显示,HOPX mRNA和蛋白在宫颈癌肿瘤组织及血清中均低表达,且与患者生存期呈正相关(r=0.736,P<0.05);HOPX在组织及血清中表达与CEA和CA125的表达显著负相关(r=-0.678,P<0.05)。过表达HOPX抑制HeLa细胞增殖、迁移和侵袭能力,而且能够促进HeLa细胞中ETM相关的E-cadherin的表达、抑制Vimentin和ICAM1的表达(均P<0.05或P<0.01)。结论:HOPX基因在宫颈癌组织及血清中相对低表达,且与CEA和CA125水平呈负相关,与患者的生存期呈正相关。HOPX结合肿瘤标志物CEA/CA125联合检测可提高宫颈癌患者的早期诊断率,也为宫颈癌的精准治疗提供一个新的思路。]]>

          <![CDATA[肿瘤免疫治疗的两大重要进展:(1)在体外激活或通过基因修饰的T细胞进行体内输注;(2)通过抗体使体内被抑制的免疫细胞激活并处于相对持续作用状态。前者的基因修饰的T细胞主要是指嵌合抗原受体T(CAR-T)细胞,其对部分血液肿瘤产生了明显的疗效;后者主要指免疫检查点抗体,其对基因突变较多的肿瘤产生了明显的疗效。对于肿瘤患者而言,其肿瘤局部微环境的免疫抑制状态往往明显高于全身的免疫抑制状态。要将肿瘤局部微环境的免疫状况调整到正常或增强,全身用药时可能引发其它正常组织免疫反应过强,甚至导致严重损害,如间质性肺炎、急性心肌炎及严重肝损伤。本文通过总结肿瘤免疫微环境的形成和分类、肿瘤治疗和免疫治疗的发展历程,阐述靶向肿瘤微环境的重要性,提出了用自分泌抗体的CAR-T细胞(白泽T细胞)高效精准靶向肿瘤局部,迅速提高肿瘤局部微环境的免疫功能,且有可能成为治愈癌症的关键策略。]]>

          <![CDATA[血浆游离DNA(cfDNA)即血液中存在的游离DNA片段,来源于良性细胞、白细胞和病毒核酸等。肿瘤细胞通过坏死、凋亡、分泌向血液中释放的游离DNA即为循环肿瘤DNA(ctDNA),属于cfDNA的一种。ctD-NA存在于肿瘤患者的血液循环中,便于获得,并且由于其在血液中循环,ctDNA检测可以及时反映肿瘤状态。ctDNA保留了肿瘤特异性基因特征和表观遗传学特征,如癌基因和抑癌基因的点突变、拷贝数变异、DNA甲基化和染色体重排,这一特点促使ctDNA成为重要的生物标志物。近年来,消化系统肿瘤在中国的发病率和病死率均上升,且呈年轻化趋势,多数患者确诊时已为中晚期。因此,完善消化系统肿瘤的诊断和筛查手段,延长患者的生存期,提高患者的生活质量面临着严峻挑战,也是当前的研究重点。ctDNA作为一种液体活检技术,因其操作简便、侵害性小、重复性高、易于动态监测等优势,在消化系统肿瘤领域获得了广泛研究。本文就ctDNA在消化系统肿瘤中的临床应用现状和前景作一综述。]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract Background: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15189 standard provides recommendations for the postexamination reporting phase to enhance quality in clinical laboratories. The purpose of this study was to encourage a broad discussion on current reporting practices for molecular diagnostic tests by conducting a global survey of such practices. Methods: The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine’s Committee for Molecular Diagnostics (IFCC C-MD) surveyed laboratories on selected ISO 15189 recommendations and topics. The survey addressed the following aspects: (1) laboratory demographics, (2) report format, (3) result reporting/layout, (4) comments in report and (5) interpretation and clinical decision-making information. Additionally, participants indicated categories needing standardization. Results: Sixteen responses from laboratories located in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and South America were received. Several categories yielded 100% agreement between laboratories, whereas other categories had less than or equal to 50% concordance. Participants scored “nomenclature” and “description of methodologies” as the two most frequently cited aspects needing standardization. Conclusions: The postexamination phase requires extensive and consistent communication between the laboratory, the healthcare provider and the end user. Surveyed laboratories were most likely to follow explicit ISO 15189 recommendations vs. recommendations when the term(s) “where appropriate or where applicable” was used. Interpretation and reporting of critical values varied among participants. Although the outcome of this study may not fully represent the practices of all molecular testing laboratories in countries around the world, the survey identified and specified several recommendations that are requirements for harmonized reporting in molecular diagnostics.]]>

          <![CDATA[Abstract More than 200 participants from Europe, Asia, Africa and South America attended the two days ICGEB Workshop on Next Generation Diagnostics, 22/03/2018-24/03/2018, at the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MASA) in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia. The meeting provided an overview of the current and future use of next generation sequencing (NGS), proteomics and other high-throughput technologies in the diagnostic setup of malignant, inherited and communicable diseases. In addition, considerable emphasis was placed on the potential use of these techniques for disease prognostication, patient stratification and monitoring responses to therapy. Specific topics included NGS-based diagnostics of solid tumors, hematological malignancies, inherited and infectious diseases, proteomic-based approaches for biomarker discovery, predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies, and bioinformatic analysis of NGS data. The meeting also provided a unique platform for fruitful discussions between internationally recognized experts and young researchers from developing countries, providing new perspectives and ideas on broader implementation of these techniques for personalized management and care.]]>

          <![CDATA[精准医疗是一种强烈依赖病人基因组分析结果的医疗模式,而子串检索是执行基因组分析的重要方法。近年来,基因数据的数据量急剧增长,其存储代价和处理复杂度已远超医疗方可承受的范围。于是,利用云服务提供商廉价的存储设备和强大的计算能力,将基因数据托管至云服务提供商成为切实可行的解决方案。考虑到云服务提供商并不完全可信,在数据上传至云端之前执行数据加密是保证数据安全性和隐私性的有效方法。然而,如何基于加密数据执行序列检索成为亟待解决的问题。针对这一问题,对基因数据处理和密文检索领域进行调研,提出采用q-gram技术对序列数据的定长窗口创建前缀签名的方案,并在执行查询时在每个窗口中完成前缀查询的解决方案。在子序列查询过程中,云端并不能获取用户数据明文。最后通过实验验证了所提方案具有较好的性能和存储开销,例如当窗口大小为100且q取6时,对100000长序列串执行构建索引耗时15.06s。与GPSE相比,所提方法的性能更优。]]>

          <![CDATA[Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technologies are currently being applied in both research and clinical settings for the understanding and management of disease. The goal is to use high-throughput sequencing to identify specific variants that drive tumorigenesis within each individual's tumor genomic profile. The significance of copy number and structural variants in glioblastoma makes it essential to broaden the search beyond oncogenic single nucleotide variants toward whole genome profiles of genetic aberrations that may contribute to disease progression. The heterogeneity of glioblastoma and its variability of cancer driver mutations necessitate a more robust examination of a patient's tumor genome. Here, we present patient whole genome sequencing (WGS) information to identify oncogenic structural variants that may contribute to glioblastoma pathogenesis. We provide WGS protocols and bioinformatics approaches to identify copy number and structural variations in 41 glioblastoma patient samples. We present how WGS can identify structural diversity within glioblastoma samples. We specifically show how to apply current bioinformatics tools to detect EGFR variants and other structural aberrations from DNA whole genome sequencing and how to validate those variants within the laboratory. These comprehensive WGS protocols can provide additional information directing more precise therapeutic options in the treatment of glioblastoma.]]>

          <![CDATA[Past 25y have witnessed an exponential increase in knowledge and understanding of ocular diseases and their respective genetic underpinnings. As a result, scientists have mapped many genes and their variants that can influence vision and health of our eyes. Based on these findings, it is becoming clear that an early diagnosis employing genetic testing can help evaluate patients' conditions for instituting treatment plan(s) and follow-up care to avoid vision complications later. For example, knowing family history becomes crucial for inherited eye diseases as it can benefit members in family who may have similar eye diseases or predispositions. Therefore, gathering information from an elaborate examination along with complete assessment of past medical illness by ophthalmologists followed by consultation with geneticists can help create a roadmap for making diagnosis and treatment precise and beneficial. In this review, we present an update on ocular genomic medicine that we believe has tremendous potential towards unraveling genetic implications in ocular diseases and patients' susceptibilities. We also discuss translational aspects of genetic ophthalmology and genome engineering that may help advance molecular diagnostics and therapeutics.]]>

          <![CDATA[Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative dementia that affects nearly 50 million people worldwide and is a major source of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. While there have been many attempts to develop disease-modifying therapies for late-onset AD, none have so far shown efficacy in humans. However, the long latency between the initial neuronal changes and onset of symptoms, the ability to identify patients at risk based on family history and genetic markers, and the emergence of AD biomarkers for preclinical disease suggests that early risk-reducing interventions may be able to decrease the incidence of, delay or prevent AD. In this review, we discuss six mechanisms-dysregulation of glucose metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, trophic factor release, amyloid burden, and calcium toxicity-involved in AD pathogenesis that offer promising targets for risk-reducing interventions. In addition, we offer a blueprint for a multi-modality AD risk reduction program that can be clinically implemented with the current state of knowledge. Focused risk reduction aimed at particular pathological factors may transform AD to a preventable disorder in select cases.]]>

          <![CDATA[Modeling and simulation in computational neuroscience is currently a research enterprise to better understand neural systems. It is not yet directly applicable to the problems of patients with brain disease. To be used for clinical applications, there must not only be considerable progress in the field but also a concerted effort to use best practices in order to demonstrate model credibility to regulatory bodies, to clinics and hospitals, to doctors, and to patients. In doing this for neuroscience, we can learn lessons from long-standing practices in other areas of simulation (aircraft, computer chips), from software engineering, and from other biomedical disciplines. In this manuscript, we introduce some basic concepts that will be important in the development of credible clinical neuroscience models: reproducibility and replicability; verification and validation; model configuration; and procedures and processes for credible mechanistic multiscale modeling. We also discuss how garnering strong community involvement can promote model credibility. Finally, in addition to direct usage with patients, we note the potential for simulation usage in the area of Simulation-Based Medical Education, an area which to date has been primarily reliant on physical models (mannequins) and scenario-based simulations rather than on numerical simulations.]]>

          <![CDATA[The microbiome not only represents a vital modifier of health and disease, but is a clinically important drug target. Therefore, study of the impact of the human microbiome on drug metabolism, toxicity and efficacy is urgently needed. This review focuses on gut and vaginal microbiomes, and the effect of those microbiomes or components thereof on the pharmacokinetics of specific chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapies, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs. In some cases, the presence of specific bacterial species within the microbiome can alter the metabolism of certain drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents and antiviral drugs. These microbiota-drug interactions are identified mostly through studies using germ-free or microbiome-depleted animal models, or by the administration of specific bacterial isolates. The biotransformation of drugs can cause drug-related toxicities; however, biotransformation also provides a mechanism by which drug developers could exploit host microbiota to create more site-specific drugs. Within this review we consider the importance of the route of drug administration and interactions with microbiota at various mucosal sites. Notably, we discuss the potential utility of bacterial therapeutics in altering the microbiome to enhance therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcomes in a personalized fashion. Based on the data to date, there is a clinically important relationship between microbiota and drug metabolism throughout the lifespan; therefore, profiling of the human microbiome will be essential in order to understand the mechanisms by which these microbiota-drug interactions occur and the degree to which this complex interplay affects drug efficacy.]]>

          <![CDATA[The production of soluble amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) and the activation of inflammation are two important early steps in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The central role of oligomers as responsible for the neuronal dysfunction associated with the clinical features has been extended to the other protein misfolding disorders definable, on this basis, as oligomeropathies. In AD, recent evidence indicates that the mechanism of inflammation as a consequence of neurodegeneration must be assessed in favor of a more direct role of glial activation in the alteration of synaptic function. Our own experimental models demonstrate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments in preventing the cognitive deficits induced acutely by AβOs applied directly in the brain. Moreover, some promising clinical tools are based on immunological activation reducing the presence of cerebral Aβ deposits. However, the strategies based on the control of inflammatory factors as well as the amyloid aggregation show poor or non-therapeutic efficacy. Numerous studies have examined inflammatory factors in biological fluids as possible markers of the neuroinflammation in AD. In some cases, altered levels of cytokines or other inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid correlate with the severity of the disease. Here we propose, according to the precision medicine principles, innovative therapeutic approaches to AD based on the patient's inflammatory profile/state. The earlier intervention and a multifactor approach are two other elements considered essential to improve the chances of effective therapy in AD.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine is being enabled in high-income countries by the growing availability of health data, increasing knowledge of the genetic determinants of disease and variation in response to treatment (pharmacogenomics), and the decreasing costs of data generation, which promote routine application of genomic technologies in the health sector. However, there is uncertainty about the feasibility of applying precision medicine approaches in low- and middle-income countries, due to the lack of population-specific knowledge, skills, and resources. The Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative was established to drive new research into the genetic and environmental basis for human diseases of relevance to Africans as well as to build capacity for genomic research on the continent. Precision medicine requires this capacity, in addition to reference data on local populations, and skills to analyze and interpret genomic data from the bedside. The H3Africa consortium is collectively processing samples and data for over 70,000 participants across the continent, accompanied in most cases by rich clinical information on a variety of non-communicable and infectious diseases. These projects are increasingly providing novel insights into the genetic basis of diseases in indigenous populations, insights that have the potential to drive the development of new diagnostics and treatments. The consortium has also invested significant resources into establishing high-quality biorepositories in Africa, a bioinformatic network, and a strong training program that has developed skills in genomic data analysis and interpretation among bioinformaticians, wet-lab researchers, and health-care professionals. Here, we describe the current perspectives of the H3Africa consortium and how it can contribute to making precision medicine in Africa a reality.]]>

          <![CDATA[Germline and tumor pharmacogenomics impact drug responses, but germline markers less commonly guide oncology prescribing. The authors hypothesized that a critical number of clinically actionable germline pharmacogenomic associations exist, representing clinical implementation opportunities.;;In total, 125 oncology drugs were analyzed for positive germline pharmacogenomic associations in journals with impact factors ≥5. Studies were assessed for design and genotyping quality, clinically relevant outcomes, statistical rigor, and evidence of drug-gene effects. Associations from studies of high methodologic quality were deemed potentially clinically actionable, and translational summaries were written as point-of-care clinical decision support (CDS) tools and formally evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.;;The authors identified germline pharmacogenomic results for 56 of 125 oncology drugs (45%) across 173 publications. Actionable associations were detected for 12 drugs, including 6 that had germline pharmacogenomic information within US Food and Drug Administration labels or published guidelines (capecitabine/fluorouracil/dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [DPYD], irinotecan/uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 [UGT1A1], mercaptopurine/thioguanine/thiopurine S-methyltransferase [TPMT], tamoxifen/cytochrome P450 [CYP] family 2 subfamily D member 6 [CYP2D6]), and 6 others were novel (asparaginase/nuclear factor of activated T-cells 2 [NFATC2]/human leukocyte antigen D-related β1 [HLA-DRB1], cisplatin/acylphosphatase 2 [ACYP2], doxorubicin/adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily C member 2/Rac family small guanosine triphosphatase 2/neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 [ABCC2/RAC2/NCF4], lapatinib/human leukocyte antigen DQ α1 [HLA-DQA1], sunitinib/cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 5 [CYP3A5], vincristine/centrosomal protein 72 [CEP72]). By using AGREE II, the developed CDS summaries had high mean ± standard deviation scores (maximum score, 100) for scope and purpose (92.7 ± 5.1) and rigour of development (87.6 ± 7.4) and moderate yet robust scores for clarity of presentation (58.6 ± 25.1) and applicability (55.9 ± 24.6). The overall mean guideline quality score was 5.2 ± 1.0 (maximum score, 7). Germline pharmacogenomic CDS summaries for these 12 drugs were recommended for implementation.;;Several oncology drugs have actionable germline pharmacogenomic information, justifying their delivery through institutional pharmacogenomic implementations to determine clinical utility.

          <![CDATA[Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disease that causes severe damage to the lungs. Ivacaftor, the first drug that targeted the underlying defect of the disease caused by specific mutations, is a sterling example of the potential of precision medicine. Clinical trial and registry studies showed that ivacaftor improved outcomes and reduced hospitalizations. Our study used US administrative claims data to assess the real-world effectiveness of ivacaftor. Comparing twelve-month rates before and after starting the use of ivacaftor among people who initiated therapy during 2012-2015, we found that overall and cystic fibrosis-related inpatient admissions fell by 55 percent and 81 percent, respectively. There was a comparable reduction in inpatient spending. Ivacaftor appears to be effective for multiple mutations that cause the disease, as suggested by the fact that during the study period, ivacaftor's use was extended to nine additional mutations in 2014. Examination of evidence from clinical trial, clinical care, and administrative data sources is important for understanding the real-world effectiveness of precision medicines such as ivacaftor.]]>

          <![CDATA[The therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is challenging because of poor prognosis. There are urgent demands for targeting anti-tumor drugs with reliable efficacy and clear pharmacokinetics. Methods : We designed and synthesized an active tumor-targeting prodrug for the precision therapy of NSCLC. The prodrug polyamine analog Gefitinib (PPG) was derived from the conjugation between a tumor-targeting ligand polyamine analog (PA) and an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib via a cleavable disulfide linker. Furthermore, the integration of the near-infrared azo -BODIPY fluorophore into the structure of the prodrug PPG yielded an activatable fluorescent theranostics (TPG), which could be used to monitor the in real-time delivery of prodrug PPG and initiate precise medicine in vivo . Results : PPG efficiently delivered the anti-tumor drug to cancer cells and reduced the serious side effects of the drug to normal cells, thereby increasing the potent of the anti-tumor drug. PPG was not only efficacious for killing Gefitinib-sensitive PC9 cells, but also for inhibiting the growth of Gefitinib-resistant H1650 cells. We provided a new evidence that the tumor-targeting PA ligand could inhibit the Akt pathway in H1650 cells, and had a synergistic effect with Gefitinib for anticancer efficacy. The in vivo results on nude mice bearing tumors of NSCLC cell lines demonstrated that PPG could target tumor lesions and had the expected therapeutic effects. Finally, we used TPG for fluorescent labeling of transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) specimens. The results indicated that TPG could provide rapid diagnosis for lung cancer within 4 h. Conclusion: Our work had identified that PPG could be effectively used for the treatment of Gefitinib-resistance NSCLC in cells and in mice models. The theranostic TPG emerged as a promising fluorescent imaging tool for the application in the therapy and diagnosis of NSCLC.]]>

          <![CDATA[Cascade screening is the process of contacting relatives of people who have been diagnosed with certain hereditary conditions. Its purpose is to identify, inform, and manage those who are also at risk. We conducted a scoping review to obtain a broad overview of cascade screening interventions, facilitators and barriers to their use, relevant policy considerations, and future research needs. We searched for relevant peer-reviewed literature in the period 1990-2017 and reviewed 122 studies. Finally, we described 45 statutes and regulations related to the use and release of genetic information across the fifty states. We sought standardized best practices for optimizing cascade screening across various geographic and policy contexts, but we found none. Studies in which trained providers contacted relatives directly, rather than through probands (index patients), showed greater cascade screening uptake; however, policies in some states might limit this approach. Major barriers to cascade screening delivery include suboptimal communication between the proband and family and geographic barriers to obtaining genetic services. Few US studies examined interventions for cascade screening or used rigorous study designs such as randomized controlled trials. Moving forward, there remains an urgent need to conduct rigorous intervention studies on cascade screening in diverse US populations, while accounting for state policy considerations.]]>

          <![CDATA[The majority of studies comparing active psychological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not find significant differences at posttreatment. This was the case in a recent trial examining prolonged exposure (PE) and virtual reality exposure (VRE) among active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD. Matching individual patients to specific treatments provides a potential avenue to improve significantly the public health impact of effective treatments for PTSD. A composite moderator approach was used to identify profiles of patients who would see superior PTSD symptom reduction in VRE or PE to inform future treatment matching.;;Active duty U.S. army soldiers (N = 108) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing VRE and PE in the treatment of PTSD stemming from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. Eighteen baseline variables were examined to identify treatment response heterogeneity in two patient groups: those with a superior response to PE and those with a superior response to VRE. The final composite moderator comprised four of 18 baseline variables.;;Results revealed that patients who were predicted to see greater PTSD symptom reduction in VRE were likely to be younger, not taking antidepressant medication, had greater PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, and were more likely to have greater than minimal suicide risk.;;Results suggest that treatment matching based on patient profiles could meaningfully improve treatment efficacy for combat-related PTSD. Future research can build on these results to improve our understanding of how to improve treatment matching for PTSD.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine has shed new light on the treatment of heterogeneous cancer patients. However, intratumor heterogeneity strongly constrains the clinical benefit of precision medicine. Thus, rethinking therapeutic strategies from a different facet within the precision medicine framework will not only diversify clinical interventions, but also provide an avenue for precision medicine. Here, we explore the current approaches for targeting intratumor heterogeneity and their limitations. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical strategy with a homogenization feature based on iatrogenic evolutionary selection to target intratumor heterogeneity.]]>

          <![CDATA[Systems biology is today such a widespread discipline that it becomes difficult to propose a clear definition of what it really is. For some, it remains restricted to the genomic field. For many, it designates the integrated approach or the corpus of computational methods employed to handle the vast amount of biological or medical data and investigate the complexity of the living. Although defining systems biology might be difficult, on the other hand its purpose is clear: systems biology, with its emerging subfields systems medicine and systems pharmacology, clearly aims at making sense of complex observations/experimental and clinical datasets to improve our understanding of diseases and their treatments without putting aside the context in which they appear and develop. In this short review, we aim to specifically focus on these new subfields with the new theoretical tools and approaches that were developed in the context of cancer. Systems pharmacology and medicine now give hope for major improvements in cancer therapy, making personalized medicine closer to reality. As we will see, the current challenge is to be able to improve the clinical practice according to the paradigm shift of systems sciences.]]>

          <![CDATA[Purpose: Pediatric cancers are often difficult to classify and can be complex to treat. To ensure precise diagnostics and identify relevant treatment targets, we implemented comprehensive molecular profiling of consecutive pediatric patients with cancer relapse. We evaluated the clinical impact of extensive molecular profiling by assessing the frequency of identified biological onco-drivers, altered diagnosis, and/or identification of new relevant targeted therapies. Patients and Methods: Forty-six tumor samples (44 fresh-frozen; two formalin-fixed paraffin embedded), two bone marrow aspirates, three cerebrospinal fluid samples, and one archived DNA were obtained from 48 children (0-17 years; median 9.5) with relapsed or refractory cancer, where the disease was rapidly progressing in spite of their current treatment or they had exhausted all treatment options. The samples were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNAseq), transcriptome arrays, and SNP arrays. Final reports were available within 3-4 weeks after patient inclusion and included mutation status, a description of copy number alterations, differentially expressed genes, and gene fusions, as well as suggestions for targeted treatment. Results: Of the 48 patients, 33 had actionable findings. The most efficient method for the identification of actionable findings was WES (39%), followed by SNP array (37%). Of note, gene fusions were identified by RNAseq in 21% of the samples. Eleven findings led to clinical intervention, i.e., oncogenetic counseling, targeted treatment, and treatment based on changed diagnosis. Four patients received compassionate use targeted therapy. Six patients experienced direct benefits in the form of stable disease or response. Conclusion: The application of comprehensive genetic diagnostics in children with recurrent cancers allowed for discovery and implementation of effective targeted therapies and hereby improvement of outcome in some patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Since Garrod's first description of alkaptonuria in 1902, and newborn screening for phenylketonuria introduced in the 1960s, P4 medicine (preventive, predictive, personalized, and participatory) has been a reality for the clinician serving patients with inherited metabolic diseases. The era of high-throughput technologies promises to accelerate its scale dramatically. Genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, glycomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics offer an amazing opportunity for holistic investigation and contextual pathophysiologic understanding of inherited metabolic diseases for precise diagnosis and tailored treatment. While each of the -omics technologies is important to systems biology, some are more mature than others. Exome sequencing is emerging as a reimbursed test in clinics around the world, and untargeted metabolomics has the potential to serve as a single biochemical testing platform. The challenge lies in the integration and cautious interpretation of these big data, with translation into clinically meaningful information and/or action for our patients. A daunting but exciting task for the clinician; we provide clinical cases to illustrate the importance of his/her role as the connector between physicians, laboratory experts and researchers in the basic, computer, and clinical sciences. Open collaborations, data sharing, functional assays, and model organisms play a key role in the validation of -omics discoveries. Having all the right expertise at the table when discussing the diagnostic approach and individualized management plan according to the information yielded by -omics investigations (e.g., actionable mutations, novel therapeutic interventions), is the stepping stone of P4 medicine. Patient participation and the adjustment of the medical team's plan to his/her and the family's wishes most certainly is the capstone. Are you ready?]]>

          <![CDATA[Data sharing is a precondition of precision medicine. Numerous organizations have produced abundant guidance on data sharing. Despite such efforts, data are not being shared to a degree that can trigger the expected data-driven revolution in precision medicine. We set out to explore why. Here we report the results of a comprehensive analysis of data-sharing guidelines issued over the past two decades by multiple organizations. We found that the guidelines overlap on a restricted set of policy themes. However, we observed substantial fragmentation in the policy landscape across specific organizations and data types. This may have contributed to the current stalemate in data sharing. To move toward a more efficient data-sharing ecosystem for precision medicine, policy makers should explore innovative ways to cope with central policy themes such as privacy, consent, and data quality; focus guidance on interoperability, attribution, and public engagement; and promote data-sharing policies that can be adapted to multiple data types.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine is making an impact on patients, health care delivery systems, and research participants in ways that were only imagined fifteen years ago when the human genome was first sequenced. Discovery of disease-causing and drug-response genetic variants has accelerated, while adoption into clinical medicine has lagged. We define precision medicine and the stakeholder community required to enable its integration into research and health care. We explore the intersection of data science, analytics, and precision medicine in the formation of health systems that carry out research in the context of clinical care and that optimize the tools and information used to deliver improved patient outcomes. We provide examples of real-world impact and conclude with a policy and economic agenda necessary for the adoption of this new paradigm of health care both in the United States and globally.]]>

          <![CDATA[Despite rapid advances in molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics, the adoption of precision medicine into clinical oncology workflows has been slow. Questions about clinical utility, inconsistent reimbursement for molecular diagnostics, and limited access to targeted therapies are some of the major hurdles that have hampered clinical adoption. Despite these challenges, providers have invested in precision medicine programs in an ongoing search for innovative care models to deliver improved patient outcomes and achieve economic gains. We describe the precision oncology medicine programs implemented by an integrated delivery system, a community care center, and an academic medical center, to demonstrate the approaches and challenges associated with clinical implementation efforts designed to advance this treatment paradigm. Payer policies that include coverage for broad genomic testing panels would support the broader application of precision medicine, deepen research benefits, and bring targeted therapies to more patients with advanced cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Despite advances in cancer biology and therapeutics, drug resistance remains problematic. Resistance is often multifactorial, heterogeneous, and prone to undersampling. Nonetheless, many individual mechanisms of targeted therapy resistance may coalesce into a smaller number of convergences, including pathway reactivation (downstream re-engagement of original effectors), pathway bypass (recruitment of a parallel pathway converging on the same downstream output), and pathway indifference (development of a cellular state independent of the initial therapeutic target). Similar convergences may also underpin immunotherapy resistance. Such parsimonious, convergence-based frameworks may help explain resistance across tumor types and therapeutic categories and may also suggest strategies to overcome it.]]>

          <![CDATA[Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, which has a substantial genetic component. AD affects predominantly older people. Accordingly, the prevalence of dementia has been rising as the population ages. To date, there are no effective interventions that can cure or halt the progression of AD. The only available treatments are the management of certain symptoms and consequences of dementia. The current state-of-the-art medical care for AD comprises three simple principles: prevent the preventable, achieve early diagnosis, and manage the manageable symptoms. This review provides a summary of the current state of knowledge of risk factors for AD, biological diagnostic testing, and prospects for treatment. Special emphasis is given to recent advances in genetics of AD and the way genomic data may support prevention, early intervention, and development of effective pharmacological treatments. Mutations in the APP, PSEN1 , and PSEN2 genes cause early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) that follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. For late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), APOE4 was identified as a major risk allele more than two decades ago. Population-based genome-wide association studies of late onset AD have now additionally identified common variants at roughly 30 genetic loci. Furthermore, rare variants (allele frequency <1%) that influence the risk for LOAD have been identified in several genes. These genetic advances have broadened our insights into the biological underpinnings of AD. Moreover, the known genetic risk variants could be used to identify presymptomatic individuals at risk for AD and support diagnostic assessment of symptomatic subjects. Genetic knowledge may also facilitate precision medicine. The goal of precision medicine is to use biological knowledge and other health information to predict individual disease risk, understand disease etiology, identify disease subcategories, improve diagnosis, and provide personalized treatment strategies. We discuss the potential role of genetics in advancing precision medicine for AD along with its ethical challenges. We outline strategies to implement genomics into translational clinical research that will not only improve accuracy of dementia diagnosis, thus enabling more personalized treatment strategies, but may also speed up the discovery of novel drugs and interventions.]]>

          <![CDATA[A goal of the Precision Medicine Initiative All of Us Research Program (AoURP) is recruitment of participants who reflect the diversity of the US. Recruitment from among blood bank donors, which may better reflect the demographic makeup of local communities, is one proposed strategy. We evaluated this strategy by analyzing the results of a survey of San Diego Blood Bank donors conducted in November 2015. Whites were more likely than nonwhites to respond to the survey (7.1 percent versus 3.9 percent). However, race was not a significant predictor of interest in participating in precision medicine research. Using census data linked to donors' ZIP codes, we also found that people who indicated interest in research participation were more likely to come from regions with higher educational attainment. Although blood banks represent a viable recruitment strategy for AoURP, our findings indicate that bias toward inclusion of whites and more highly educated people persists.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine is predicted to revolutionize the clinical practice of medicine, in part by using molecular biomarkers to assess patients' risk, prognosis, and therapeutic response more precisely. However, reliance on biomarkers could present challenges for diverse populations that are not equitably represented in precision medicine research. We examined the populations included in genomic studies whose data were available in the following two public databases: the Genome-Wide Association Study Catalog and the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. We found significantly fewer studies of African, Latin American, and Asian ancestral populations in comparison to European populations. These patterns were consistent across both data types and disease areas. While the number of genomic research studies that include non-European populations is modestly improving, the overall numbers are still low, and decisive action is needed now to implement the changes necessary for realizing the promise of precision medicine for all.]]>

          <![CDATA[Designing effective therapeutic strategies for complex diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration that involve tissue context-specific interactions among multiple gene products presents a major challenge for precision medicine. Safe and selective pharmacological modulation of individual molecular entities associated with a disease often fails to provide efficacy in the clinic. Thus, development of optimized therapeutic strategies for individual patients with complex diseases requires a more comprehensive, systems-level understanding of disease progression. Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is an approach to drug discovery that integrates computational and experimental methods to understand the molecular pathogenesis of a disease at the systems level more completely. Described here is the chemogenomic component of QSP for the inference of biological pathways involved in the modulation of the disease phenotype. The approach involves testing sets of compounds of diverse mechanisms of action in a disease-relevant phenotypic assay, and using the mechanistic information known for the active compounds, to infer pathways and networks associated with the phenotype. The example used here is for monogenic Huntington's disease (HD), which due to the pleiotropic nature of the mutant phenotype has a complex pathogenesis. The overall approach, however, is applicable to any complex disease.]]>

          <![CDATA[The diffusion of genomic testing is critical to the success of precision medicine, but there is limited information on oncologists' uptake of genetic technology. We aimed to assess the frequency with which medical oncologists and surgeons order BRCA 1/2 and Oncotype DX testing for breast cancer patients.;;We surveyed 732 oncologists and surgeons treating breast cancer patients. Physicians were from Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and were listed in the 2010 AMA Masterfile or identified by patients.;;80.6% of providers ordered BRCA 1/2 testing at least sometimes and 85.4% ordered Oncotype DX (p = 0.01). More frequent ordering of BRCA 1/2 was associated with more positive attitudes toward genetic innovation (OR 1.14, p = 0.001), a belief that testing was likely to be covered by patients' insurance (OR 2.84, p < 0.001), and more frequent ordering of Oncotype DX testing (OR 8.69, p < 0.001). More frequent use of Oncotype DX was associated with a belief that testing was likely to be covered by insurance (OR 7.33, p < 0.001), as well as with more frequent ordering of BRCA 1/2 testing (OR 9.48, p < 0.001).;;Nearly one in five providers never or rarely ever ordered BRCA 1/2 testing for their breast cancer patients, and nearly 15% never or rarely ever ordered Oncotype DX. Less frequent ordering of BRCA 1/2 is associated with less frequent use of Oncotype DX testing, and vice versa. Those who do not order BRCA 1/2 testing report less positive attitudes toward genetic innovation. Further education of this subset of providers regarding the benefits of precision medicine may enable more rapid diffusion of genetic technology.]]>

The purpose of this study was to encourage a broad discussion on current reporting practices for molecular diagnostic tests by conducting a global survey of such practices.;;The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine's Committee for Molecular Diagnostics (IFCC C-MD) surveyed laboratories on selected ISO 15189 recommendations and topics. The survey addressed the following aspects: (1) laboratory demographics, (2) report format, (3) result reporting/layout, (4) comments in report and (5) interpretation and clinical decision-making information. Additionally, participants indicated categories needing standardization.;;Sixteen responses from laboratories located in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and South America were received. Several categories yielded 100% agreement between laboratories, whereas other categories had less than or equal to 50% concordance. Participants scored nomenclature and description of methodologies as the two most frequently cited aspects needing standardization.;;The postexamination phase requires extensive and consistent communication between the laboratory, the healthcare provider and the end user. Surveyed laboratories were most likely to follow explicit ISO 15189 recommendations vs. recommendations when the term(s) where appropriate or where applicable was used. Interpretation and reporting of critical values varied among participants. Although the outcome of this study may not fully represent the practices of all molecular testing laboratories in countries around the world, the survey identified and specified several recommendations that are requirements for harmonized reporting in molecular diagnostics.]]>

          <![CDATA[Undifferentiated spindle-cell sarcoma (USCS) is a recalcitrant cancer, resistant to conventional chemotherapy. A patient with high-grade USCS from a striated muscle was implanted orthotopically in the right biceps femoris muscle of mice to establish a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model. The PDOX models were randomized into the following groups when tumor volume reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup> : G1, control without treatment; G2, doxorubicin (DOX) (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.] injection, weekly, for 2 weeks); G3, temozolomide (TEM) (25 mg/kg, p.o., daily, for 14 days). Tumor size and body weight were measured with calipers and a digital balance twice a week. TEM significantly inhibited tumor volume growth compared to the untreated control and the DOX-treated group on day 14 after treatment initiation: control (G1): 343 ± 78 mm<sup>3</sup> ; DOX (G2): 308 ± 31 mm<sup>3</sup> , P = 0.272; TEM (G3): 85 ± 21 mm<sup>3</sup> , P < 0.0001. TEM significantly regressed the tumor volume compared to day 0 (P = 0.019). There were no animal deaths in any group. The body weight of treated mice was not significantly different in any group. Tumors treated with DOX were comprised of spindle-shaped viable cells without apparent necrosis or inflammatory changes. In contrast, tumors treated with TEM showed extensive tumor necrosis. The present study demonstrates the potential power of matching the patient with an effective drug and saving the patient needless toxicity from ineffective drugs.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background: While precision medicines targeting genetic mutations and alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been available since 2010, their adoption into clinical practice has been slow. Evidence suggests that a number of barriers, such as insufficient clinician knowledge, a need for training of test providers, or a lack of specific clinical guidelines, may slow the implementation of precision in general. However, little attention has been given to the barriers to providing precision medicines in NSCLC. The purpose of this protocol is to outline the design for a qualitative interview study to identify the barriers and facilitators to the provision of precision medicines for NSCLC. Methods: This study will use semi-structured interviews with clinicians (n=10), test providers (n=10), and service commissioners (n=10) to identify the perceived barriers and facilitators to providing historical, current, and future precision medicines in NSCLC. Participants will be identified through mailing list advertisements and snowball sampling. Recruitment will continue until data saturation, indicated by no new themes arising from the data. Interviews will be conducted by telephone to facilitate geographical diversity. The qualitative data will be analysed using a framework analysis with themes anticipated to relate to; relevant barriers to providing precision medicines, the impact of different barriers on medicine provision, changes in the ability to provide precision medicines over time, and strategies to facilitate the provision of precision medicines. Ethics: This study has been approved by the University of Manchester Proportionate Review Research Ethics Committee (Reference number: 2017-1885-3619). Written consent will be obtained from all participants. Conclusion: This study is the first to explore the barriers and facilitators to providing precision medicines for NSCLC in the English NHS. The findings will inform strategies to improve the implementation of future precision medicines. These findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and national and international conferences.]]>

          <![CDATA[Predictive biomarkers (PBioMs) are objective biological measures that predict response to medical treatments for diseases. The current study translates methods used in the field of precision medicine to identify PBioMs to identify parallel predictive behavioral markers (PBMs), defined as objective behavioral measures that predict response to treatment. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by examining the accuracy of two PBMs for automatically reinforced self-injurious behavior (ASIB). Results of the analysis indicated both functioned as good to excellent PBMs. We discuss the compatibility of this approach with applied behavior analysis, describe methods to identify additional PBMs, and posit that variables related to the mechanisms of problem behavior and putative mechanism of treatment action hold the most promise as potential PBMs. We discuss how this technology could guide individualized treatment selection, inform our understanding of problem behavior and mechanisms of treatment action, and help determine the conditional effectiveness of clinical procedures.]]>

          <![CDATA[Cancer remains a global killer alongside cardiovascular disease. A better understanding of cancer biology has transformed its management with an increasing emphasis on a personalized approach, so-called precision cancer medicine. Imaging has a key role to play in the management of cancer patients. Imaging biomarkers that objectively inform on tumor biology, the tumor environment, and tumor changes in response to an intervention complement genomic and molecular diagnostics. In this review we describe the key principles for imaging biomarker development and discuss the current status with respect to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).(#br)LEVEL OF EVIDENCE(#br)5 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 5 J.

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency have been established to be strongly associated with increased overall mortality and deaths from specific aging-related diseases. Recently, an epigenetic mortality risk score (MS) based on whole blood DNA methylation at the 10 most prominent mortality-related cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites has also been found to be highly related to all-cause mortality. This study aimed to explore whether vitamin D status, defined by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, is associated with the MS and to what extent both indicators are individually and jointly capable of predicting all-cause mortality in a general population sample of older adults.(#br)Results(#br)The MS was derived from the blood DNA methylation profiles measured by Illumina Human Methylation 450K Beadchip, and serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured among 1467 participants aged 50-75 of the German ESTHER cohort study. There was no association between vitamin D status and the MS at baseline, but both metrics were prominently and independently associated with all-cause mortality during a median follow-up of 15.2 years. The combination of both indicators showed the potential to be a particularly strong prognostic index for all-cause mortality. Participants with vitamin D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) and high MS (> 5 CpG sites with aberrant methylation) had almost sixfold mortality (hazard ratio 5.79, 95% CI 3.06-10.94) compared with participants with sufficient vitamin D (≥ 50 nmol/L) and a low MS (0-1 CpG site with aberrant methylation).(#br)Conclusions(#br)This study suggests that vitamin D and the MS are strong independent predictors of all-cause mortality in older adults.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine endeavors to conform therapeutic interventions to the individuals being treated. Implicit to the concept of precision medicine is heterogeneity of treatment benefit among patients and patient subpopulations. Thus, precision medicine challenges conventional paradigms of clinical translational which have relied on estimates of population-averaged effects to guide clinical practice. Basket trials comprise a class of experimental designs used to study solid malignancies that are devised to evaluate the effectiveness of a therapeutic strategy among patients defined by the presence of a particular drug target (often a genetic mutation) rather than a particular tumor histology. Acknowledging the potential for differential effectiveness on the basis of traditional criteria for cancer subtyping, evaluations of treatment effectiveness are conducted with respect to the baskets which collectively represent a partition of the targeted patient population consisting of discrete subtypes. Yet, designs of early basket trials have been criticized for their reliance on basketwise analysis strategies that suffered from limited power in the presence of imbalanced enrollment as well as failed to convey to the clinical community evidentiary measures for consistent effectiveness among the studied clinical subtypes. This article presents novel methodology for sequential basket trial design formulated with Bayesian monitoring rules. Interim analyses are based a novel hierarchical modeling strategy for sharing information among a collection of discrete potentially nonexchangeable subtypes. The methodology is demonstrated by analysis as well as permutation and simulation studies based on a recent basket trial designed to estimate the effectiveness of vemurafenib in BRAFV600 mutant non-melanoma among six primary disease sites and histologies.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Genotype-guided warfarin dosing has been shown in some randomized trials to improve anticoagulation outcomes in individuals of European ancestry, yet its utility in Asian patients remains unresolved.(#br)METHODS(#br)An open-label, non-inferiority, 1:1 randomized trial was conducted at three academic hospitals in South East Asia, involving 322 ethnically diverse patients newly indicated for warfarin (NCT00700895). Clinical follow-up was 90 days. The primary efficacy measure was the number of dose titrations within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with a mean non-inferiority margin of 0.5 over the first 14 days of therapy.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Among 322 randomized patients, 269 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Compared with traditional dosing, the genotype-guided group required fewer dose titrations during the first 2 weeks (1.77 vs. 2.93, difference -1.16, 90% CI -1.48 to -0.84, P < 0.001 for both non-inferiority and superiority). The percentage of time within the therapeutic range over 3 months and median time to stable international normalized ratio (INR) did not differ between the genotype-guided and traditional dosing groups. The frequency of dose titrations (incidence rate ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, P = 0.001), but not frequency of INR measurements, was lower at 1, 2, and 3 months in the genotype-guided group. The proportions of patients who experienced minor or major bleeding, recurrent venous thromboembolism, or out-of-range INR did not differ between both arms. For predicting maintenance doses, the pharmacogenetic algorithm achieved an R2 = 42.4% (P < 0.001) and mean percentage error of -7.4%.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)Among Asian adults commencing warfarin therapy, a pharmacogenetic algorithm meets criteria for both non-inferiority and superiority in reducing dose titrations compared with a traditional dosing approach, and performs well in prediction of actual maintenance doses. These findings imply that clinicians may consider applying a pharmacogenetic algorithm to personalize initial warfarin dosages in Asian patients.(#br)TRIAL REGISTRATION(#br)ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00700895 .

          <![CDATA[INTRODUCTION(#br)Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex psychiatric condition characterised by craving, compulsive seeking, loss of control of alcohol consumption, as well as the emergence of negative emotional states during withdrawal. Despite the large socioeconomic burden of AUD, therapeutic treatment options lag behind. Areas covered: This review covers pharmacotherapies currently in phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of alcohol use disorders listed on clinicaltrials.gov. We discuss drug therapies that modulate monoamine, GABA/Glutamate, neuropeptide and neuroimmune systems. We examine in depth preclinical and clinical evidence of a select range of these compounds and consider their utility in treating AUDs. Expert opinion: Current therapeutic options to treat AUD are inadequate at a population level. Currently there are 30 different compounds and one compound combination in phase I/II clinical trials for AUD. These compounds target various aspects of neurotransmitter signalling, neuroimmune modulation and alcohol metabolism. Almost 75% of these compounds under trial are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for other indications, which may save time and costs in treatment development. Further, development of therapeutics focused on genetic biomarkers and behavioural screening may improve how treatment decisions are made in the future on a case-by-case basis.]]>

          <![CDATA[Mixed neuroendocrine-nonneuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) are a group of rare tumors previously known as mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs). The neuroendocrine component is high-grade and may consist of small-cell carcinoma or large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The nonneuroendocrine component may consist of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. We report a unique case of a MiNEN with trilineage differentiation: large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. The reported patient presented with symptoms of an upper gastrointestinal bleed and was ultimately diagnosed with a MiNEN with trilineage differentiation. This is the first report of this exceedingly rare tumor type to include next-generation sequencing of the 3 separate tumor entities. In addition, we review the current literature and discuss the role of next-generation sequencing in classifying and treating MiNEN tumors.]]>

          <![CDATA[Identification of the four Standard Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors (SMuRFs)-diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and cigarette smoking has allowed the development of risk scores. These have been used in conjunction with primary and secondary prevention strategies targeting SMuRFs to reduce the burden of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent studies show that up to 25% acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients do not have any SMuRFs. Thus, SMuRFs do not explain the entire burden of CAD. There appears to be variation at the individual level rendering some individuals relatively susceptible or resilient to developing atherosclerosis. Important disease pathways remain to be discovered and there is renewed enthusiasm to discover novel biomarkers, biological mechanisms and therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. Two broad approaches are being taken: traditional approaches investigating known candidate pathways; and unbiased omics approaches. We review recent progress in the field and discuss opportunities made possible by technological and data science advances. Developments in network analytics and machine learning algorithms used in conjunction with large scale multi-omic platforms have the potential to uncover biological networks that may not have been identifiable using traditional approaches. These approaches are useful for both biomedical research and precision medicine strategies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.]]>

          <![CDATA[Transfer learning (TL) algorithms aim to improve the prediction performance in a target task (e.g. the prediction of cisplatin sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer patients) via transferring knowledge from auxiliary data of a related task (e.g. the prediction of docetaxel sensitivity in breast cancer patients), where the distribution and even the feature space of the data pertaining to the tasks can be different. In real-world applications, we sometimes have a limited training set in a target task while we have auxiliary data from a related task. To obtain a better prediction performance in the target task, supervised learning requires a sufficiently large training set in the target task to perform well in predicting future test examples of the target task. In this paper, we propose a TL approach for cancer drug sensitivity prediction, where our approach combines three techniques. First, we shift the representation of a subset of examples from auxiliary data of a related task to a representation closer to a target training set of a target task. Second, we align the shifted representation of the selected examples of the auxiliary data to the target training set to obtain examples with representation aligned to the target training set. Third, we train machine learning algorithms using both the target training set and the aligned examples. We evaluate the performance of our approach against baseline approaches using the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) on real clinical trial datasets pertaining to multiple myeloma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and breast cancer. Experimental results show that our approach is better than the baseline approaches in terms of performance and statistical significance.]]>

          <![CDATA[OBJECTIVE(#br)Risk-sharing contracts (RSC) present a novel management tool, which link the payment to the pharmaceutical company to health outcomes. The objective of this work was to know the perception of health professionals about the utility of these agreements in the Spanish National Health System.(#br)METHODS(#br)A questionnaire was designed to conduct a series of semi-structured interviews with hospital pharmacy, laboratory and oncology professionals from Spanish hospitals in Madrid, Aragón, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Cataluña, La Rioja, País Vasco and Navarra. The selection criteria was for convenience. The interview period was from April to November 2017. A qualitative analysis was performed based on the responses from 14 interviews.(#br)RESULTS(#br)All the surveyed affirmed that the CRCs allow to improve the economic and administrative management of the hospital, emphasizing as main advantages the budgetary control, the obtaining of funding and the savings possibilities. CRCs are perceived (13 of 14 respondents) as agreements with positive health implications because they increased the portfolio of treatments and had greater efficacy. The need for CRCs to register patients, involved monitoring and control, also contributed to the improvement of their health. In addition, CRCs were believed (8 out of 14 respondents) to facilitate the introduction of personalized medicine (MP) as both depend on diagnostic tests, one for screening reasons (MP) and the other for obtain clinical evidences that improve economic outcomes (CRC). However, it was considered that signing the CRCs entails the need to modify certain regulations (5 out of 14 respondents) as well as to increase the number of staff to handle bureaucratic tasks and to increase laboratory tests, which can complicate health management.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)Qualitative social research techniques have proven to be useful for gathering information on a new topic and understanding the perception of the advantages and disadvantages of CRCs, as well as their association with the MP. In addition, synergies were detected between the CRCs and the MP. Respondents had positive opinions on CRCs about its application, although work must be done in order to improve the normative and organizational context so that the additional complexity that they incorporate does not constitute an obstacle to extend its use.(#br)OBJETIVO(#br)Los contratos de riesgo compartido (CRC) presentan un novedoso instrumento de gestión sanitaria que condiciona el pago a la compañía farmacéutica dependiendi de si el paciente tratado con su fármaco es curado con éxito. El objetivo de este trabajo fue conocer la percepción de los profesionales sanitarios acerca de la utilidad de dichos acuerdos en el Sistema Nacional de Salud español.(#br)METODOS(#br)Se diseñó un cuestionario para realizar una serie de entrevistas semiestructuradas con profesionales de farmacia hospitalaria, laboratorio y oncología de hospitales españoles de Madrid, Aragón, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Cataluña, La Rioja, País Vasco y Navarra. El criterio de selección fue de conveniencia. El periodo de realización de las entrevistas fue de abril a noviembre de 2017. Se efectuó un análisis cualitativo a partir de las respuestas de 14 entrevistas.(#br)RESULTADOS(#br)Todos los encuestados afirmaron que los CRC permiten mejorar la gestión económica y administrativa del hospital, destacando el control presupuestario, la obtención de financiación y la posibilidad de ahorro como ventajas principales. Los CRC son percibidos (13 de 14 entrevistados) como acuerdos con implicaciones positivas para la salud porque aumentaban el portfolio de tratamientos disponibles y porque los tratamientos introducidos contaban con una mayor eficacia. La necesidad de los CRC de registrar a los pacientes implicaba un seguimiento y control que también se entendió contribuía a la mejora de su salud. Además, los CRC se creyó (8 de 14 entrevistados) que favorecían la introducción de la medicina personalizada (MP) ya que tanto la MP como los CRC dependen e impulsan la elaboración de pruebas diagnósticas, ya sea por motivos de cribado (MP) o de aumentar las evidencias clínicas para mejorar los resultados económicos (CRC). No obstante, se consideró que la firma de los CRC conlleva la necesidad de modificar ciertas normativas (5 de 14 entrevistados), de aumentar las plantillas para encargarse de tareas burocráticas, como la elaboración de registros, y también de incrementar las pruebas de laboratorio, lo cual puede complicar la gestión sanitaria.(#br)CONCLUSIONES(#br)En general, los CRC contaron con opiniones positivas acerca de su aplicación aunque deba trabajarse para mejorar el contexto normativo y organizativo de modo que la complejidad adicional que incorporan no constituya una traba para extender su uso. Además, se detectaron sinergias entre los CRC y la MP.]]>

          <![CDATA[Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition intermediate between physiological brain aging and dementia. Amnesic-MCI (aMCI) subjects progress to dementia (typically to Alzheimer-Dementia=AD) at an annual rate which is 20 times higher than that of cognitively intact elderly. The present study aims to investigate whether EEG network Small World properties (SW) combined with Apo-E genotyping, could reliably discriminate aMCI subjects who will convert to AD after approximately a year. 145 aMCI subjects were divided into two sub-groups and, according to the clinical follow-up, were classified as Converted to AD(C-MCI, 71) or Stable(S-MCI, 74). Results showed significant differences in SW in delta, alpha1, alpha2, beta2, gamma bands, with C-MCI in the baseline similar to AD. Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve, based on a first-order polynomial regression of SW, showed 57% sensitivity, 66% specificity and 61% accuracy(area under the curve: AUC=0.64). In 97 out of 145 MCI, Apo-E allele testing was also available. Combining this genetic risk factor with Small Word EEG, results showed: 96.7% sensitivity, 86% specificity and 91.7% accuracy(AUC=0.97). Moreover, using only the Small World values in these 97 subjects, the ROC showed an AUC of 0.63; the resulting classifier presented 50%sensitivity, 69%specificity and 59.6%accuracy. When different types of EEG analysis (power density spectrum) were tested, the accuracy levels were lower (68.86%). Concluding, this innovative EEG analysis, in combination with a genetic test (both low-cost and widely available), could evaluate on an individual basis with great precision the risk of MCI progression. This evaluation could then be used to screen large populations and quickly identify aMCI in a prodromal stage of dementia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.]]>

          <![CDATA[Background(#br)Precision medicine therapies require identification of unique molecular cancer characteristics. Hexokinase (HK) activity has been proposed as a therapeutic target; however, different hexokinase isoforms have not been well characterized as alternative targets. While HK2 is highly expressed in the majority of cancers, cancer subtypes with differential HK1 and HK2 expression have not been characterized for their sensitivities to HK2 silencing.(#br)Methods(#br)HK1 and HK2 expression in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia dataset was analyzed. A doxycycline-inducible shRNA silencing system was used to examine the effect of HK2 knockdown in cultured cells and in xenograft models of HK1-HK2+ and HK1+HK2+ cancers. Glucose consumption and lactate production rates were measured to monitor HK activity in cell culture, and 18F-FDG PET/CT was used to monitor HK activity in xenograft tumors. A high-throughput screen was performed to search for synthetically lethal compounds in combination with HK2 inhibition in HK1-HK2+ liver cancer cells, and a combination therapy for liver cancers with this phenotype was developed. A metabolomic analysis was performed to examine changes in cellular energy levels and key metabolites in HK1-HK2+ cells treated with this combination therapy. The CRISPR Cas9 method was used to establish isogenic HK1+HK2+ and HK1-HK2+ cell lines to evaluate HK1-HK2+ cancer cell sensitivity to the combination therapy.(#br)Results(#br)Most tumors express both HK1 and HK2, and subsets of cancers from a wide variety of tissues of origin express only HK2. Unlike HK1+HK2+ cancers, HK1-HK2+ cancers are sensitive to HK2 silencing-induced cytostasis. Synthetic lethality was achieved in HK1-HK2+ liver cancer cells, by the combination of DPI, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, and HK2 inhibition, in HK1-HK2+ liver cancer cells. Perhexiline, a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, further sensitizes HK1-HK2+ liver cancer cells to the complex I/HK2-targeted therapeutic combination. Although HK1+HK2+ lung cancer H460 cells are resistant to this therapeutic combination, isogenic HK1KOHK2+ cells are sensitive to this therapy.(#br)Conclusions(#br)The HK1-HK2+ cancer subsets exist among a wide variety of cancer types. Selective inhibition of the HK1-HK2+ cancer cell-specific energy production pathways (HK2-driven glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation), due to the unique presence of only the HK2 isoform, appears promising to treat HK1-HK2+ cancers. This therapeutic strategy will likely be tolerated by most normal tissues, where only HK1 is expressed.]]>

          <![CDATA[Different fields of cancer management consider bone health to be of increasing clinical importance for patients: 1) presence of bone metastases in many solid tumors, 2) use of bone-targeted treatments in the reduction of bone metastasis, 3) effects of cancer treatment on reproductive hormones, critical for normal bone remodeling maintenance. Additionally, bone microenvironment is further complicated by the decline of ovarian sex steroid production and by the related increase in inflammatory factors linked to menopause, which result in accelerated bone loss and increased risk of osteoporosis (OP). Similarly, cancers and metastasis to bone showed a close relationship with sex hormones (particularly estrogen). Thus, these findings raise a question: Could pre-existing estrogen deficiency OP promote and/or influence cancer cell homing and tumor growth in bone? Although some preclinical and clinical evidence exists, it is mandatory to understand this aspect that would be relevant in the clinical theatre, where physicians need to understand the treatments available to reduce the risk of skeletal disease in cancer patients. This descriptive systematic review summarizes preclinical and clinical studies dealing with bimodal interactions between pre-existing estrogen deficiency OP and bone metastasis development and provides evidence supporting differences in tumor growth and colonization between healthy and OP status. Few studies evaluated the impact of estrogen deficiency OP on the susceptibility to bone metastases. Therefore, implementing biological knowledge, could help researchers and clinicians to have a better comprehension of the importance of pre- and post-menopausal bone microenvironment and its clinical implications for precision medicine in cancer patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[Facing metastasis is the most pressing challenge of cancer research. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, highlighting the kinetics of cancer stem cell and the role of the epithelial mesenchymal transition for metastasis. It appears that the tumor micro-environment plays a crucial role in triggering phenotypic transitions, as we illustrate discussing the challenges posed by macrophages and cancer associated fibroblasts. To disentangle the complexity of environmentally induced phenotypic transitions, there is a growing need for novel advanced algorithms as those proposed in our recent work combining single cell data analysis and numerical simulations of gene regulatory networks. We conclude discussing recent developments in artificial intelligence and its applications to personalized cancer treatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[INTRODUCTION(#br)Hypertension is a complex and multifactorial cardiovascular disorder. With different mechanisms contributing to a different extent to an individual's blood pressure, the discovery of novel pathogenetic principles of hypertension is challenging. However, there is an urgent and unmet clinical need to improve prevention, detection, and therapy of hypertension in order to reduce the global burden associated with hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases. Areas covered: Proteomic techniques have been applied in reductionist experimental models including angiotensin II infusion models in rodents and the spontaneously hypertensive rat in order to unravel mechanisms involved in blood pressure control and end organ damage. In humans proteomic studies mainly focus on prediction and detection of organ damage, particularly of heart failure and renal disease. While there are only few proteomic studies specifically addressing human primary hypertension, there are more data available in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, such as preeclampsia. We will review these studies and discuss implications of proteomics on precision medicine approaches. Expert commentary: Despite the potential of proteomic studies in hypertension there has been moderate progress in this area of research. Standardized large-scale studies are required in order to make best use of the potential that proteomics offers in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine is an emerging approach to the prevention and treatment of disease that takes into account variability in genes, environment and lifestyle for each individual. Precision medicine is transforming clinical and biomedical research, as well as health care itself, from a conceptual, as well as a methodological viewpoint, providing extraordinary opportunities to improve public health and lower the costs of the healthcare system. However, the implementation of precision medicine poses ethical-legal, regulatory, organizational and knowledge-related challenges. Without a national strategy, precision medicine -which eventually will be implemented one way or another- could take place without the appropriate planning to guarantee technical quality and equal access to the best practices for all citizens, thus violating the rights of patients and professionals as well as jeopardizing the solvency of the healthcare system. This paper from the Spanish Societies of Medical Oncology (SEOM), Pathology (SEAP) and Hospital Pharmacy (SEFH), highlights the need to institute a consensual national strategy for the development of precision medicine in our country, reviews the national and international context, comments on the opportunities and challenges for implementing precision medicine and outlines the objectives of a national strategy on precision medicine in cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records (EHRs) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous EHR narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present EHR-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput EHR framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. EHR-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from EHR narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the HPO-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed EHR-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by EHR-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p < 2.2 × 10-16), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent EHR dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional EHR datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from EHRs can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, EHR-Phenolyzer leverages EHR narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Immunotherapies are some of the most promising emergent treatments for several cancers, yet there remains a majority of patients who do not benefit from them due to immune-resistant tumors. One avenue for enhancing treatment for these patients is by converting these tumors to an immunoreactive state, thereby restoring treatment efficacy. By leveraging regulatory networks we previously characterized in autoimmunity, here we show that overexpression of the master regulator IKZF1 leads to enhanced immune infiltrate recruitment and tumor sensitivity to PD1 and CTLA4 inhibitors in several tumors that normally lack IKZF1 expression. This work provides proof of concept that tumors can be rendered susceptible by hijacking immune cell recruitment signals through molecular master regulators. On a broader scale, this work also demonstrates the feasibility of using computational approaches to drive the discovery of novel molecular mechanisms toward treatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[PURPOSE(#br)Genomic studies have demonstrated the necessity of ethnicity-specific population data to ascertain variant pathogenicity for disease diagnosis and treatment. This study examined the carrier prevalence of treatable inherited disorders (TIDs), where early diagnosis of at-risk offspring can significantly improve clinical outcomes.(#br)METHODS(#br)Existing exome/ genome sequencing data of 831 Singaporeans were aggregated and examined for disease causing variants in 104 genes associated with 80 TIDs.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Among the 831 Singaporean participants, genomic variant filtering and analysis identified 1 in 18 individuals (6%) to be carriers amongst one of 13 TIDs. Citrin deficiency and Wilson disease had the highest carrier frequency of 1 in 41, and 1 in 103 individuals, respectively. The pathogenic variants associated with citrin deficiency were 24 times more prevalent in our local cohorts when compared to Western cohorts.(#br)CONCLUSION(#br)This study demonstrates the value of a population specific genomic database to determine true disease prevalence and has enabled the discovery of carrier frequencies of treatable genetic conditions specific to South East Asian populations, which are currently underestimated in existing data sources. This study framework can be adapted to other population groups and expanded to multiple genetic conditions to inform health policies directing precision medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine is an approach to medical treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle and allows for personalization that is based on factors that may affect the response to treatment. Several genetic and epigenetic risk factors have been shown to increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). As such, it may be beneficial to integrate genetic risk factors into the AD prevention approach, which in the past has primarily been focused on universal risk-reduction strategies for the general population rather than individualized interventions in a targeted fashion. This review discusses examples of a one-size-fits-all versus clinical precision medicine AD prevention strategy, in which the precision medicine approach considers two genes that can be commercially sequenced for polymorphisms associated with AD, apolipoprotein E (APOE), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Comparing these two distinct approaches provides support for a clinical precision medicine prevention strategy, which may ultimately lead to more favorable patient outcomes as the interventions are targeted to address individualized risks.]]>

          <![CDATA[INTRODUCTION(#br)Precision medicine aims to focus on meeting patient requirements accurately, optimizing patient outcomes, and reducing under-/overdiagnosis and therapy. We aim to offer a fresh perspective on accuracy driven “age-old precision medicine” and illustrate how newer case-based blended learning ecosystems (CBBLE) can strengthen the bridge between age-old precision approaches with modern technology and omics-driven approaches.(#br)METHODOLOGY(#br)We present a series of cases and examine the role of precision medicine within a “case-based blended learning ecosystem” (CBBLE) as a practicable tool to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment. We illustrated the workflow of our CBBLE through case-based narratives from global students of CBBLE in high and low resource settings as is reflected in global health.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Four micro-narratives based on collective past experiences were generated to explain concepts of age-old patient-centered scientific accuracy and precision and four macro-narratives were collected from individual learners in our CBBLE. Insights gathered from a critical appraisal and thematic analysis of the narratives were discussed.(#br)DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(#br)Case-based narratives from the individual learners in our CBBLE amply illustrate their journeys beginning with “age-old precision thinking” in low-resource settings and progressing to “omics-driven” high-resource precision medicine setups to demonstrate how the approaches, used judiciously, might reduce the current pandemic of over-/underdiagnosis and over-/undertreatment.]]>

          <![CDATA[Given the rapid development in precision medicine, tremendous efforts have been devoted to discovering new biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment. Esophageal cancer-related gene-4 (ECRG4), which is initially known as a new candidate tumor suppressor gene, is emerging as a sentinel molecule for gauging tissue homeostasis. ECRG4 is unique in its cytokine-like functional pattern and epigenetically-regulated gene expression pattern. The gene can be released from the cell membrane upon activation and detected in liquid biopsy, thus offering considerable potential in precision medicine. This review provides an updated summary on the biology of ECRG4, with emphasis on its important roles in cancer diagnosis and therapy. The future perspectives of ECRG4 as a potential molecular marker in precision medicine are also discussed in detail.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of symptom presentation and, likely, underlying pathophysiology. Accordingly, it is possible that only certain individuals with MDD are well-suited to antidepressants. A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to focus on promising endophenotypes of depression, such as neuroticism, anhedonia, and cognitive control deficits.(#br)METHODS(#br)Within an 8-week multisite trial of sertraline v. placebo for depressed adults (n = 216), we examined whether the combination of machine learning with a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) can generate individualized treatment recommendations on the basis of endophenotype profiles coupled with clinical and demographic characteristics.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Five pre-treatment variables moderated treatment response. Higher depression severity and neuroticism, older age, less impairment in cognitive control, and being employed were each associated with better outcomes to sertraline than placebo. Across 1000 iterations of a 10-fold cross-validation, the PAI model predicted that 31% of the sample would exhibit a clinically meaningful advantage [post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) difference ⩾3] with sertraline relative to placebo. Although there were no overall outcome differences between treatment groups (d = 0.15), those identified as optimally suited to sertraline at pre-treatment had better week 8 HRSD scores if randomized to sertraline (10.7) than placebo (14.7) (d = 0.58).(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)A subset of MDD patients optimally suited to sertraline can be identified on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics. This model must be tested prospectively before it can be used to inform treatment selection. However, findings demonstrate the potential to improve individual outcomes through algorithm-guided treatment recommendations.]]>

          <![CDATA[Anaphylaxis is the most serious of all allergic reactions and can be fatal. The diagnosis is frequently delayed, and misdiagnosis often occurs with asthma or urticaria. Biomarkers such as tryptase are not routinely checked, and appropriate treatment with epinephrine is not administered in a majority of cases, increasing the risk of poor outcomes. The objective of this review is to provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis with a description of phenotypes, endotypes, and biomarkers available in both the clinical and research settings. Expanding knowledge with regard to the presentation, causes, and triggers for anaphylaxis among health care providers will improve its diagnosis and management, increase patient safety, and decrease morbidity and mortality.]]>

          <![CDATA[Molecular tumour boards (MTBs) offer recommendations for potentially effective, but potentially burdensome, molecularly targeted treatments to a patient's treating physician. In this paper, we discuss the question of who is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate evidence base for any treatments recommended to a patient. We argue that, given that treating oncologists cannot usually offer a robust evaluation of the evidence underlying an MTB's recommendation, members of the MTB are responsible for ensuring that the evidence level is adequate. We explore two models for how to share responsibility between MTB members. According to the first model, each MTB member, as well as the treating physician, should be held maximally and equally responsible for the recommendations. We argue that this insufficiently accounts for differences in roles and expertise of MTB members. We propose instead that responsibility is delegated via relationships of trust. We argue if these relationships of trust are to be instances of reasonable trust, (a) MTBs should offer a clinical representative to whom a treating physician may delegate the responsibility of ensuring there is sufficient evidence for treatment recommendations, (b) the relationships of trust between the representative and the other MTB members should be clearly defined, and (c) MTB members should be carefully selected. Treating oncologists retain a responsibility to consider general limitations of the evidence for targeted treatments in assessing whether the treatment recommendation offered by an MTB's representative is adequate for a given clinical situation.]]>

          <![CDATA[Precision medicine uses biomarkers to diagnose disease. However, they can also be used to measure risk of disease. Thus, biomarkers herald a new addition to public health - Precision Public Health. We examine the implications. Risk biomarkers are identified by analyzing population cohorts. They constitute risk factors in mathematical 'Disease Risk Models'. The risk may be fixed as in a genetic biomarker or variable as in some protein biomarkers. They help monitor current risk of disease in an individual, thereby aiding efforts to reduce risk. In the UK, the NHS Health Check system is a universal system for assessing risk and for risk reduction. The system can now make use of modern biomarkers once appropriate infrastructure and governance are in place.]]>

          <![CDATA[Multiple ongoing, government-funded national efforts longitudinally collect health data and biospecimens for precision medicine research with ascertainment strategies increasingly emphasizing underrepresented groups in biomedical research. We surveyed chronic kidney disease patients from an academic, public integrated tertiary care system in Cleveland, Ohio, to examine local attitudes toward participation in large-scale government-funded studies. Responses ( n = 103) indicate the majority (71%) would participate in a hypothetical national precision medicine cohort and were willing to send biospecimens to a national repository and share de-identified data, but <50% of respondents were willing to install a phone app to track personal data. The majority of participants (62%) indicated that return of research results was very important, and the majority (54%) also wanted all of their research-collected health and genetic data returned. Response patterns did not differ by race/ethnicity. Overall, we found high willingness to participate among this Cleveland patient population already participating in a local genetic study. These data suggest that despite common perceptions, subjects from communities traditionally underrepresented in genetic research will participate and agree to store samples and health data in repositories. Furthermore, most participants want return of research results, which will require a plan to provide these data in a secure, accessible, and understandable manner.]]>

          <![CDATA[With the advancement in drug development, multiple treatments are available for a single disease. Patients can often benefit from taking multiple treatments simultaneously. For example, patients in Clinical Practice Research Datalink with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes can receive multiple treatments simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to estimate what combination therapy from which patients can benefit the most. However, to recommend the best treatment combination is not a single label but a multilabel classification problem. In this paper, we propose a novel outcome weighted deep learning algorithm to estimate individualized optimal combination therapy. The Fisher consistency of the proposed loss function under certain conditions is also provided. In addition, we extend our method to a family of loss functions, which allows adaptive changes based on treatment interactions. We demonstrate the performance of our methods through simulations and real data analysis.]]>

          <![CDATA[The miminally-invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) uses different types of acupuncture needles to treat diseased locations with special techniques. These techniques include different methods of insertion and closed incision (press cutting, sliding cutting, scrape cutting, etc.). This needling technique is based on the traditional Chinese medicine theories of Pi Bu (cutaneous), Jing Jin (sinew), Jing Luo (meridian), Wu Ti (five body structure components) and Zang Fu (organ system). Commonly used needles include: needle Dao , needle with edge, Pi needle, Shui needle, Ren needle, Gou needle, Chang Yuan needle, Bo needle and so on.(#br)The principle of this minimally-invasive technique of TCM is to achieve the greatest healing benefit with the least amount of anatomical and physiological intervention. This will result in the highest standard of health care with the lowest rehabilitative need and burden of care.(#br)In the past 20 years, through the collaborative research of several hundred hospitals across China, we systemically reviewed the best minimally invasive technique of TCM and the first line treatments for selective conditions. In 2013, the Department of Medical Affairs of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine created Traditional Chinese Medicine Technical Manual(General Version) and released it nationwide, its contents include: (1)Minimally invasive scar tissue release. ¹Suitable for Bi and pain syndromes of neck, shoulder, waist, buttocks and extremities. ²Degeneration causes local hypertrophy and inflammation, creating local tissue adhesion. ³There are two kind incision methods-press cutting and slide cutting. (2)Minimally invasive fascial tension release. ¹Suitable for localized fascial tension caused by trauma, overuse, or wind-cold-dampness, leading to compensatory hyperplasia. ²Long term high-stress stimulation to local fascia creates compensatory hyperplasia, Ashi points, and tissue texture changes (cords, nodules, masses). ³According to the different structural features of the needles, there are two incision methods: penetrating from the outside to the inside and pulling from inside to outside. (3)Minimally invasive decompression technique. ¹Suitable for internal pressure changes within organ cavities caused by trauma, degeneration, inflammation, such as compartment syndrome, bone marrow edema, increased intraluminal pressure in the bone marrow. ²According to the different tissues, it is categorized into soft tissue decompression, and bone decompression. (4)Minimally invasive orthopedic surgery. Applicable to some postural, developmental deformity correction, mainly through the dynamic balance method and/or static balance method. (5)Minimally invasive dissection. Suitable for fractures, tendons injury caused by deep soft tissue adhesion. (6)Minimally invasive separation. ¹Suitable for cutaneous, sinew regions, superficial adhesions due to lesions, and local post-operative incision adhesions. ²According to the structure of the needle tip, the methods are divided into sharp separation and blunt dissection. (7)Minimally invasive sustained pressure technique. ¹Suitable for neuromuscular dysfunction which causes JING (spasm) syndrome and WEI (atrophy) syndrome. ²The needle is applied with sustained pressure, without penetrating select tissue surface. This includes: nerve root sustained pressure technique; peripheral nerve sustained pressure technique; muscle sustained pressure technique; fascial contact procedure; cutaneous sustained pressure technique.(8)Minimally invasive insertion technique. ¹Suitable for systemic regulation to treat disease. ²Different organs are connected to different layers of tissue. Therefore, to treat specific conditions, specific tissues must be targeted. ³For example, back Shu points are used to treat vertigo from cervical spine issues, and spinal degeneration associated digestion issue. ⁴The internal organs can be regulated by the pathways that runs along the different layers of tissue. The types of stimulation include: meridian acupoint stimulation; cutaneous stimulation; fascia stimulation; mucle stimulation; periosteum stimulation.(#br)The clinical application of these techniques has enriched the drug-free therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and achieved excellent outcomes, but at the same time it also raises an important question. How can we apply these minimally invasive techniques to clinical practice so it can be safe and effective? In addition, how can practitioners, individually and further develop their understanding of this minimally invasive technique progressive manner?(#br)We make the following recommendations.(#br)(1)Clear diagnosis and precise application. Any approach has specific indications and choosing the correct technique comes from a comprehensive understanding of its advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the accurate application of the technique depends the expertise of the practitioner. Through systematic review and clinical observation, we formulated the First Line Treatment, the Second Line Treatment, and the Third Line Treatment for specific conditions. Using the information gathered from research, practitioners can decide on which point is appropriate to use based on the stage of disease progression. For example, common conditions like the nerve ending tension pain(i.e. cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome) is caused by stress concentration. There are two types of treatment for this condition: ¹Change in the response to stress state (i.e.non-invasive approach such as manual therapy and physiotherapy). ²Change in state of surrounding environment (i.e. invasive approach such as Pi Needle). Before tissue texture changes to pain point, cord, nodules, the former approach is effective. Once tissue texture changes, the latter approach is First Line Treatment.(#br)(2)Systematic training and disease progression training. The minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine can treat many kinds of disease. To ensure its safety, organization, progressive development, practitioners are trained systematically and manage their treatment approach through disease hierarchy. Moreover, this technique should be conducted according to its technical difficulty, operating conditions, and expertise of the practitioner. The application of minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine does not depend on the hospitals' administration system or the regulatory college of medical professionals. The minimally invasive techniques of TCM should be taught from easy to difficult, simple to complicated, and requires gradual progression by the practitioners. Eventually, the minimally invasive techniques of TCM's diagnostic and treatment protocol can be created. These protocols are currently available for reference: ¹Forming diagnosis and differential diagnosis for the conditions below requires expert diagnostic and application skills: cerebral palsy; cervical vertigo; cervical headache; cervical precordial pain; other spine-related diseases. ²The requirements for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques are relatively high, and special training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The conditions below uses minimally invasive orthopedic surgery and dissection: scar contracture deformity; congenital developmental malformations; cervical Bi -syndrome; shoulder pain syndrome; knee Bi -syndrome; low back pain; cervical spondylosis; lumbar disc herniation; avascular necrosis of the femoral head; ankylosing spondylitis. ³There are no special requirements for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques, and special training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The technical content is mainly decompression and scar tissue release. a)Muscle strain diseases: levator scapulae, splenius capitis, splenius cervicis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, teres major, serratus posterior superior, serratus posterior inferior, piriformis, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus, erector spinae. b)Joint degenerative disorders: frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, tenosynovitis, knee osteoarthritis, and plantar fascitis. c) JING-JIN PI-BU pain syndrome (cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome): occipital great nerve entrapment syndrome, occipital small nerve entrapment syndrome, great auricular nerve entrapment syndrome, suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome, transverse cutaneous nerve of neck entrapment syndrome.(#br)(3)People-centred practice. The most attractive feature of the minimally invasive techniques of TCM is that they do not rely on expensive medical equipment and operating conditions. The key to applying this technique is the practitioners' technique, skill, and expertise. The necessary conditions required to successfully apply this technique is ¹practitioner understands disease progression and diagnosis; ²practitioners' skill in applying technique. We require patient-centered approach, which uses evidence based approach as the focus. We aim to seek the truth from facts, to understand the comprehensive picture, to include pertinent details, to be observant, to be goal oriented, from one to another, from outside to inside, from top to the bottom, compare right from left, through active movement and passive movements and weight-bearing movements, and assisted passive movements to determine instantaneous centre to diagnose stress concentration points.(#br)The operating technique is based on the response of patient's tissues to this technique. We must pay attention to diagnosis through palpation: layers, structure, texture, deformity, dislocation, movement characteristic, rhythmic changes. To achieve SHOU MO XIN HUI WU WEI : position, quantify, quantity, timing, and pattern. Accurate grasp of timeliness and dose efficiency. Can distinguish between local or systemic effects of treatment. Through comprehensive judgment of hands feeling, acupuncture needle feeling, and inspiration, to achieve the precious treatment requirements as indicated by the Huangdi Neijing·Suwen : Puncture the bone without damaging tendons, and puncture tendons without damaging muscles, puncture the muscle without damaging pulse, puncture pulse without damaging skin, puncture skin without damaging muscle. Puncture muscle without damage tendons, puncture tendons without damaging bone... Puncture bone without damaging tendons and it means the needle passes through the tendons and arrives at the bone and work on the bone. Puncture tendons without damaging muscles, and it means the needle passes through the muscles and arrives close to the tendon. Puncture the muscle without damaging pulse and it means the needle passes the pulse and does not touch the muscle. Puncture pulse without damaging skin and it means, the needle passes through the skin without penetrating pulse. Puncture skin without damaging muscle and it means, the disease is in the skin and the needles insert into skin but does not damage muscle. Puncture muscle without damage tendons, and it means, the needle passes through the muscle and arrive on the tendon. Puncture tendons without damaging bone.]]>

          <![CDATA[Autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs) are complex conditions, which arise from the interaction between a genetic susceptibility and unknown environmental triggers. They represent a relevant cause of liver failure and liver transplantation worldwide. As a testimony of our progress in understanding the biology of AILDs and the disease progression is the overall median survival which has increased over the last decade. However, there are still major challenges such as the lack of therapies and surveillance strategies in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), the management and treatment of non-responders to first-line therapies in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and the need for tailoring immunosuppressive drugs in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The different disease course and treatment response in patients with AILDs might be related to a heterogeneous genetic background between individuals which translates in a heterogeneous clinical phenotype. Thus, it becomes essential to personalise management and treatment based on specific risk profiles, e.g. low-risk and high-risk, based on genetic and molecular signatures. It is now possible, thanks to the development of large-scale AILDs patient cohorts, that such diseases can be analysed using various high-throughput methods like gene expression profiling, next generation sequencing and other omics technologies to identify unique fingerprints based on which a personalised or tailor-made management and therapy can be developed. The final aim being to facilitate treatment decision-making that balances patient-specific risks and preferences. This is critical especially now with the current and forthcoming availability of more efficacious medications. To reach this point we need specific interventions such as creating bigger biobanks, sequencing more genomes and linking biological information to health-related data. We have already identified subsets of patients with different risk profiles among patients with PBC, PSC and AIH by using clinical tools such as liver histology, laboratory investigation and non-invasive methods. In this manuscript, we review the clinical features and investigations that already enable us to individualize the care of PBC patients and that might support the development of precision medicine (PM) in AILDs.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)CustomBone Service (CBS) is a patient-specific, biocompatible, and osteoconductive device made of porous hydroxyapatite, indicated for cranial reconstruction in adults and children. Adult literature data report a failure rate of about 8%. The aim of this Post-Marketing Surveillance study is to verify the hypothesis that CBS in children aged 7-13 years old shows a failure rate not superior to adults.(#br)MATERIALS AND METHODS(#br)Inclusion criteria were age at implantation ranging 7-13 years old, with at least 1 year elapsed from the date of surgery. The degree of satisfaction of surgeons and patients was assessed.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Data about 76 implants in 67 patients (M:F = 41:26) were obtained from 28 centers across 7 European countries. The mean age at surgery was 10.03 ± 1.72 years, with age stratification almost equally distributed. Fifty-nine subjects received one CBS, 7 subjects two and one subject received three CBS. Main etiologies were trauma (60.5%), malformation (11.8%), bone tumor (10.5%), and cerebral tumor (7.9%). Main indications to CBS were decompression (47.4%), autologous bone resorption (18.4%), tumor resection (11.8%), malformation (9.2%), comminuted fracture (5.3%), and other materials rejection (5.3%). Main implantation sites were fronto-parieto-temporal (26.3%), parietal (23.7%), frontal (11.8%), fronto-temporal (10.5%), and parieto-temporal (7.9%). CBS was chosen as first line of treatment in 63.1% of the cases. Mean follow-up was about 36 months. Eleven adverse events (14.5%) were reported in nine devices. Five CBS required explantation (three cases of infection, one fracture, and one mobilization). Failure rate was 6.58%, which is statistically not superior to the explantation rate recorded in adults (two-sided 95%, CI 2.2-14.7%). Satisfaction of surgeons and patients was of about 95%.(#br)CONCLUSION(#br)CBS is a safe and effective solution for cranial repair in pediatric patients. In particular, over the age of 7, CBS shows a rate of failure as low as in adults.]]>

          <![CDATA[OPINION STATEMENT(#br)The discovery of genomic alterations that drive the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has transformed how we treat metastatic disease. However, the promise of precision medicine remains elusive for the most commonly mutated oncogene in NSCLC, KRAS. This is perhaps due to the substantial heterogeneity within the broader genomic context of KRAS-mutant NSCLC. At this time, approaches for treating metastatic KRAS-mutant NSCLC mirror those for treating NSCLC that lacks a known driver mutation, including standard chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic approaches. Ongoing research aims to define further subgroups of KRAS-mutant NSCLC based on mutation subtype and co-occurring mutations. These efforts offer the potential to optimize standard-of-care regimens within these emerging subgroups and harness innovative strategies to realize precision medicine in this setting.]]>

          <![CDATA[INTRODUCTION(#br)IgE-mediated food allergy (FA) has been emerging as a public health priority. It is a potentially life-threatening condition with negative impact on the quality of life of patients and their family and its prevalence is increasing in westernized countries in the recent two decades. The current standard approach to FA consists of the strict avoidance of the triggering food. However, an elimination diet may be difficult and frustrating, above all for those foods (e.g. milk and egg) that are pivotal in the common diet. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) may increase the amount of food that the patient can intake without reaction, and reduce the risk of potential life-threatening allergic reactions. It is currently considered the most promising treatment for FA. However, many gaps are still unsolved. Areas covered: The aim of this review is to shed light on the current evidence and the main needs in OIT in order to stimulate the development of longitudinal, prospective, well-designed studies with the final goal of a precision medicine. Expert Commentary: Clinical trials for OIT conducted so far are extremely heterogeneous. The aim in the near future is to identify the most suitable candidates to OIT and algorithms for treatments tailored on well-characterized subpopulations of patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[In 2008 the Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology (LBC ONC) was established on the basis of two previous Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes working in the field of hematology and cancer research. The general aim of the LBC ONC is to improve treatment of hematopoietic neoplasms by eradicating cancer-initiating and disease-propagating cells, also known as leukemic stem cells (LSC) in the context of leukemia. In a first phase, the LBC ONC characterized the phenotype and molecular aberration profiles of LSC in various malignancies. The LSC phenotypes were established in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, the concept of preleukemic (premalignant) neoplastic stem cells (pre-L-NSC) was coined by the LBC ONC and was tested in myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Phenotypic characterization of LSC provided a solid basis for their purification and for the characterization of specific target expression profiles. In a second phase, molecular markers and targets were validated. This second phase is ongoing and should result in the development of new diagnostics parameters and novel, more effective, LSC-eradicating, treatment strategies; however, many issues still remain to be solved, such as sub-clonal evolution, LSC niche interactions, immunologic control of LSC, and LSC resistance. In the forthcoming years, the LBC ONC will concentrate on developing LSC-eradicating strategies, with special focus on LSC resistance, precision medicine and translation of LSC-eradicating concepts into clinical application.]]>

          <![CDATA[Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that consists of different phenotypes and endotypes, driven by different mechanistic pathways. An increasing number of genetic loci and single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with therapeutic responses to asthma drugs. The purpose of this review is to focus on certain susceptibility genes, gene variants and typical therapeutic drugs of the glucocorticoid, leukotriene, histamine, and β2-adrenergic receptor pathways related to asthma. Pharmacogenomics can help us better understand the genetic basis of drug responses and better define new therapeutic targets to improve treatment effectiveness.]]>

          <![CDATA[Globalization and knowledge mobilization (KM) are twin challenges impacting precision medicine currently. Previous KM models have been largely limited to an implementation framework whereby knowledge is imagined as a billiard ball to be simply rolled over from the laboratory to society and from developed to developing countries. This narrow and sanitized understanding of KM and science as being detached from social forces, human values, politics, and power inequities does not help to achieve robust and responsible emergence of precision medicine, not least because tailored medicines are not simple products ready to use off-the-shelf without customization in each country, local context and society. It is time to broaden the art and science of KM by rethinking knowledge as a dynamic co-product of both technology and social systems in which science is embedded. This article presents an analysis of the four possible approaches to KM available to the precision medicine community: (1) knowledge implementation, (2) research collaborator capacity building, (3) collaborative entanglement that removes the barriers between research and practice, and extends knowledge co-creation activities beyond scientists by inviting publics, patients, and clinicians as researchers, and (4) knowledge ecosystem approach that adopts systems thinking, addressing not only technology development but also the politics of innovation, whereby power differences in scientific practice are addressed, for example, to achieve gender parity and diversity in the scientific work force. Blending of laboratory science with KM theory and practice informs robust and responsible emergence of precision medicine innovations, and helps strike the right balance between promotion and regulation of emerging technologies.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)In uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a consensus regarding appropriate medical therapy (AMT) before surgical intervention has been published in the form of appropriateness criteria for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We sought to determine why tertiary surgeons may deviate from the suggested criteria and evaluated whether those deviations result in change in outcomes.(#br)METHODS(#br)Patients with uncomplicated CRS were prospectively enrolled over the course of 1 year. The 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22), a general health outcome out of 100, and a physician form, indicating management pathway and decision making, was completed at each visit over a 6-month follow-up period. A descriptive analysis was used to quantify reasons for veering from the appropriateness criteria, and repeated linear regression modeling was used to measure whether compliance impacted SNOT-22, general health, and Lund-Kennedy (LK) scores over the period of study.(#br)RESULTS(#br)One hundred fifty-five patients were enrolled. Sixty-eight percent followed the appropriate management pathway based on their presentation and the suggested criteria. Disparate reasons were documented for deviation in the other 32%, and, despite establishing several predictive categories, other was the most common reason, with various explanations well documented. SNOT-22, general health, and LK scores were not statistically impacted by compliancy status (p > 0.05).(#br)CONCLUSION(#br)The suggested appropriateness criteria predict a management pathway for the majority of CRS patients. However, in a tertiary sinus center, surgeons may deviate from that model with a significant minority of their patients, for multiple reasons, without causing a change in outcomes.]]>

          <![CDATA[Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes are associated with germline mutations that lead to increased vulnerability for an individual to develop cancers. Such germline mutations in tumour suppressor genes, oncogenes and genes encoding for proteins essential in DNA repair pathways and cell cycle control can cause overall chromosomal instability in the genome and increase risk in developing cancers. Gene correction of these germline mutations to restore normal protein functions is anticipated as a new therapeutic option. This can be achieved through disruption of gain-of-function pathogenic mutation, restoration of loss-of-function mutation, addition of a transgene essential for cell function and single nucleotide changes. Genome editing tools are applicable to precise gene correction. Development of genome editing tools comes in two waves. The first wave focuses on improving targeting specificity and editing efficiency of nucleases, and the second wave of gene editing draws on innovative engineering of fusion proteins combining deactivated nucleases and other enzymes that are able to create limitless functional molecular tools. This gene editing advancement is going to impact medicine, particularly in hereditary cancers. In this review, we discuss the application of gene editing as an early intervention and possible treatment for hereditary cancers, by highlighting a selection of highly penetrant cancer syndromes as examples of how this may be achieved in clinical practice.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Precision medicine puts forward customized healthcare for cancer patients. An important way to accomplish this task is to stratify patients into those who may respond to a treatment and those who may not. For this purpose, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers have been pursued.(#br)OBJECTIVE(#br)This review focuses on novel approaches and concepts of exploring biomarker discovery under the circumstances that technologies are developed, and data are accumulated for precision medicine.(#br)RESULTS(#br)The traditional mechanism-driven functional biomarkers have the advantage of actionable insights, while data-driven computational biomarkers can fulfill more needs, especially with tremendous data on the molecules of different layers (e.g. genetic mutation, mRNA, protein etc.) which are accumulated based on a plenty of technologies. Besides, the technology-driven liquid biopsy biomarker is very promising to improve patients' survival. The developments of biomarker discovery on these aspects are promoting the understanding of cancer, helping the stratification of patients and improving patients' survival.(#br)CONCLUSION(#br)Current developments on mechanisms-, data- and technology-driven biomarker discovery are achieving the aim of precision medicine and promoting the clinical application of biomarkers. Meanwhile, the complexity of cancer requires more effective biomarkers, which could be accomplished by a comprehensive integration of multiple types of biomarkers together with a deep understanding of cancer.]]>

          <![CDATA[Pathologies of the respiratory system such as lung infections, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and lung cancer are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, killing one in six people worldwide. Development of more effective treatments is hindered by the lack of preclinical models of the human lung that can capture the disease complexity, highly heterogeneous disease phenotypes, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed in patients. The merger of two novel technologies, Organs-on-Chips and human stem cell engineering, has the potential to deliver such urgently needed models. Organs-on-Chips, which are microengineered bioinspired tissue systems, recapitulate the mechanochemical environment and physiological functions of human organs while concurrent advances in generating and differentiating human stem cells promise a renewable supply of patient-specific cells for personalized and precision medicine. Here, we discuss the challenges of modeling human lung pathophysiology in vitro, evaluate past and current models including Organs-on-Chips, review the current status of lung tissue modeling using human pluripotent stem cells, explore in depth how stem-cell based Lung-on-Chips may advance disease modeling and drug testing, and summarize practical consideration for the design of Lung-on-Chips for academic and industry applications.]]>

          <![CDATA[Context(#br)Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) lack sufficient evidence, in terms of statistical power or experimental studies, to allow unequivocal determination of their damaging effect. VUSs are a major burden in performing genetic analysis. Although in silico prediction tools are widely used, their specificity is low, thus urgently calling for methods for prioritizing and characterizing variants.(#br)Objective(#br)To assess the frequency of VUSs in genes causing endocrine and metabolic disorders, the concordance rate of predictions from different in silico methods, and the added value of three-dimensional protein structure analysis in discerning and prioritizing damaging variants.(#br)Results(#br)A total of 12,266 missense variants reported in 641 genes causing endocrine and metabolic disorders were analyzed. Among these, 4123 (33.7%) were VUSs, of which 2010 (48.8%) were predicted to be damaging and 1452 (35.2%) were predicted to be tolerated according to in silico tools. A total of 5383 (87.7%) of 6133 disease-causing variants and 823 (55.8%) of 1474 benign variants were correctly predicted. In silico predictions were noninformative in 5.7%, 14.4%, and 16% of damaging, benign, and VUSs, respectively. A damaging effect on 3D protein structure was present in 240 (30.9%) of predicted damaging and 40 (9.7%) of predicted tolerated VUSs ( P < 0.001). An in-depth analysis of nine VUSs occurring in TSHR, LDLR, CASR, and APOE showed that they greatly affect protein stability and are therefore strong candidates for disease.(#br)Conclusions(#br)In our dataset, we confirmed the high sensitivity but low specificity of in silico predictions tools. 3D protein structural analysis is a compelling tool for characterizing and prioritizing VUSs and should be a part of genetic variant analysis.]]>

          <![CDATA[Technological breakthroughs in genomics have had a significant impact on clinical therapy for human diseases, allowing us to use patient genetic differences to guide medical care. The synthetic lethal approach leverages on cancer-specific genetic rewiring to deliver a therapeutic regimen that preferentially targets malignant cells while sparing normal cells. The utility of this system is evident in several recent studies, particularly in poor prognosis cancers with loss-of-function mutations that become treatable when two otherwise discrete and unrelated genes are targeted simultaneously. This review focuses on the chemotherapeutic targeting of epigenetic alterations in cancer cells and consolidates a network that outlines the interplay between epigenetic and genetic regulators in DNA damage repair. This network consists of numerous synergistically acting relationships that are druggable, even in recalcitrant triple-negative breast cancer. This collective knowledge points to the dawn of a new era of personalized medicine.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Individually tailored healthcare, in the form of precision medicine, holds substantial potential for the future of medicine, especially for a complex disorder like Parkinson's disease (PD). Patient self-tracking is an under-researched area in PD.(#br)OBJECTIVE(#br)This study aimed to explore patient-initiated self-tracking in PD and discuss it in the context of precision medicine.(#br)METHODS(#br)The first author used a smartphone app to capture finger-tapping data and also noted times for medication intakes.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Data were collected during four subsequent days. Only data from the first two days were complete enough to analyze, leading to the realization that the collection of data over a period of time can pose a significant burden to patients. From the first two days of data, a dip in finger function was observed around the time for the second medication dose of the day.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)Patient-initiated self-tracking enabled the first author to glean important insights about how her PD symptoms varied over the course of the day. Symptom tracking holds great potential in precision medicine and can, if shared in a clinical encounter, contribute to the learning of both patient and clinician. More work is needed to develop this field and extra focus needs to be given to balancing the burden of tracking for the patient against any expected benefit.]]>

          <![CDATA[Machine learning (ML) is being ubiquitously incorporated into everyday products such as Internet search, email spam filters, product recommendations, image classification, and speech recognition. New approaches for highly integrated manufacturing and automation such as the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of things are also converging with ML methodologies. Many approaches incorporate complex artificial neural network architectures and are collectively referred to as deep learning (DL) applications. These methods have been shown capable of representing and learning predictable relationships in many diverse forms of data and hold promise for transforming the future of omics research and applications in precision medicine. Omics and electronic health record data pose considerable challenges for DL. This is due to many factors such as low signal to noise, analytical variance, and complex data integration requirements. However, DL models have already been shown capable of both improving the ease of data encoding and predictive model performance over alternative approaches. It may not be surprising that concepts encountered in DL share similarities with those observed in biological message relay systems such as gene, protein, and metabolite networks. This expert review examines the challenges and opportunities for DL at a systems and biological scale for a precision medicine readership.]]>

          <![CDATA[PURPOSE OF REVIEW(#br)This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the genetic background of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), with particular attention to the genotype-phenotype correlations and the possible implications for clinical management.(#br)RECENT FINDINGS(#br)Next generation sequencing (NGS) has led to the identification of an increasing number of genes and mutations responsible for DCM. This genetic variability is probably related to the extreme heterogeneity of disease manifestation. Important findings have associated mutations of Lamin A/C (LMNA) and Filamin C (FLNC) to poor prognosis and the propensity to cause an arrhythmic phenotype, respectively. However, a deeper understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation is necessary, because it could have several implications for the clinical management of the patients. Furthermore, the correct interpretation of pathogenicity of mutations and the clinical impact of genetic testing in DCM patients still represent important fields to be implemented. A pathogenic gene mutation can be identified in almost 40% of DCM patients. The recent discoveries and future research in the field of genotype-phenotype correlation may lead to a more personalized management of the mutation carriers towards the application of precision medicine in DCM.]]>

          <![CDATA[In 2006, the group of Dr C.M. Lieber pioneered the field of nanowire sensors by fabricating devices for the ultra-sensitive label-free detection of biological macromolecules. Since then, nanowire sensors have demonstrated their ability to detect cancer-associated analytes in peripheral blood, tumor tissue, and the exhaled breath of cancer patients. These innovative developments have marked a new era with unprecedented detection performance, capable of addressing crucial needs such as cancer diagnosis and monitoring disease progression and patient response to therapy. The ability of nanowire sensors to identify molecular features of patient tumor represents a first step toward precision medicine, and their integration into portable devices has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and patient monitoring.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)IL-22 is potentially a pathogenic cytokine in AD, but molecular effects of IL-22 antagonism have not been defined in humans.(#br)OBJECTIVE(#br)We sought to evaluate cellular and molecular effects of IL-22 blockade in tissues from moderate-to-severe AD patients.(#br)METHODS(#br)We assessed lesional and non-lesional skin from 59 moderate-to-severe AD patients treated with anti-IL-22 (fezakinumab) vs. placebo (2:1), using transcriptomic and immunohistochemistry analyses.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Greater reversal of the AD genomic profile was seen with fezakinumab vs. placebo, namely 25.3% vs. 10.9% at 4wks (p=1.7*10-5) and 65.5% vs. 13.9% at 12wks (p=9.5*10-19), respectively. Since IL-22 blockade showed clinical efficacy only in severe AD, we used baseline median IL22 expression to stratify for high (n=30) and low (n=29) IL22-expression groups. Much stronger mean transcriptomic improvements were seen with fezakinumab in the IL22-high drug group (82.8% and 139.4% at 4 and 12wks, respectively), than in the respective IL22-high placebo (39.6% and 53.6% at 4 and 12wks) or the IL22-low groups. Significant downregulations of multiple immune pathways, including Th1/CXCL9, Th2/CCL18/CCL22, Th17/CCL20/DEFB4A, and Th22/IL22/S100As, were restricted to the IL22-high drug-group (p<0.05). Consistently, tissue predictors of clinical response were mostly genes involved in T-cell and dendritic cell activation and differentiation.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)This is the first report showing a profound effect of IL-22 blockade on multiple inflammatory pathways in AD. These data, supported by the robust effects in patients with high IL22 baseline expression, suggest a central role for IL-22 in AD, indicating the need for a precision medicine approach for improving therapeutic outcomes in AD.(#br)CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS(#br)Stratification of cytokine expression at baseline might help future precision medicine approaches to effectively treat atopic dermatitis patient subsets that might benefit from IL-22 antagonism or other specific blockers.]]>

          <![CDATA[PURPOSE(#br)Therapeutic decisions in breast cancer patients crucially depend on the status of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, obtained by immunohistochemistry (IHC). These are known to be inaccurate sometimes, and we demonstrate how to use gene-expression to increase precision of receptor status.(#br)METHODS(#br)We downloaded data from 3241 breast cancer patients out of 36 clinical studies. For each receptor, we modelled the mRNA expression of the receptor gene and a co-gene by logistic regression. For each patient, predictions from logistic regression were merged with information from IHC on a probabilistic basis to arrive at a fused prediction result.(#br)RESULTS(#br)We introduce Sankey diagrams to visualize the step by step increase of precision as information is added from gene expression: IHC-estimates are qualified as 'confirmed', 'rejected' or 'corrected'. Additionally, we introduce the category 'inconclusive' to spot those patients in need for additional assessments so as to increase diagnostic precision and safety.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)We demonstrate a sound mathematical basis for the fusion of information, even if partly contradictive. The concept is extendable to more than three sources of information, as particularly important for OMICS data. The overall number of undecidable cases is reduced as well as those assessed falsely. We outline how decision rules may be extended to also weigh consequences, being different in severity for false-positive and false-negative assessments, respectively. The possible benefit is demonstrated by comparing the disease free survival between patients whose IHC could be confirmed versus those for which it was corrected.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)SLIT2 is a protein ligand for the Roundabout (ROBO) receptor and was found to play a major role in repulsive midline axon guidance in central nervous system development. Based on studies utilizing knockout models, it has been postulated that SLIT2 is important for preventing inappropriate axonal routing during mammalian optic chiasm development.(#br)METHODS(#br)Case report.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Here, we report a case of congenital myopia, anisometropia, and obesity in a patient with a SLIT2 point mutation. Examination of the patient's skin biopsy revealed abnormalities in elastin and collagen fibrils that suggest an underlying connective tissue disorder. Structural modeling placed the novel mutation (p.D1407G) in the EGF-like domain 8 and was predicted to affect interactions with SLIT2 binding partners.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a SLIT2 variant in the context of these ocular findings.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Pleomorphic liposarcoma (PLPS) is a rare, heterogeneous and an aggressive variant of liposarcoma. Therefore, individualized therapy is urgently needed. Our recent reports suggest that trabectedin (TRAB) is effective against several patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models. Here, we compared the efficacy of first-line therapy, doxorubicin (DOX), and TRAB in a platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRA)-amplified PLPS.(#br)METHODS(#br)We used a fresh sample of PLPS tumor derived from a 68-year-old male patient diagnosed with a recurrent PLPS. Subcutaneous implantation of tumor tissue was performed in a nude mouse. After three weeks of implantation, tumor tissues were isolated and cut into small pieces. To match the patient a PDGFRA-amplified PLPS PDOX was created in the biceps femoris of nude mice. Mice were randomized into three groups: Group 1 (G1), control (untreated); Group 2 (G2), DOX-treated; Group 3 (G3), TRAB-treated. Measurement was done twice a week for tumor width, length, and mouse body weight.(#br)RESULTS(#br)The PLPS PDOX showed resistance towards DOX. However, TRAB could arrest the PLPS (p < 0.05 compared to control; p < 0.05 compared to DOX) without any significant changes in body-weight.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)The data presented here suggest that for the individual patient the PLPS PDOX model could specifically distinguish both effective and ineffective drugs. This is especially crucial for PLPS because effective first-line therapy is harder to establish if it is not individualized.]]>

          <![CDATA[Renal cell cancer (RCC) has become a prototype example of the extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution of human cancers. However, there is little direct evidence on how the genetic heterogeneity impacts on drug response profiles of the cancer cells. Our goal was to determine how genomic clonal evolution impacts drug responses. Finding from this study could help to define the challenge that clonal evolution poses on cancer therapy. We established multiple patient-derived cells (PDCs) from different tumor regions of four RCC patients, verified their clonal relationship to each other and to the uncultured tumor tissue by genome sequencing. Furthermore, comprehensive drug-sensitivity testing with 460 oncological drugs was performed on all PDC clones. The PDCs retained many cancer-specific copy number alterations and mutations in driver genes such as VHL, PBRM1, PIK3C2A, KMD5C and TSC2 genes. The drug testing highlighted vulnerability in the PDCs towards approved RCC drugs, such as the mTOR-inhibitor temsirolimus, but also novel sensitivities were uncovered. The individual PDC clones from different tumor regions in a patient showed distinct drug response profiles, suggesting that genomic heterogeneity contributes to the variability in drug responses. Studies of multiple PDCs from a cancer patient are informative for elucidating cancer heterogeneity and for the determination on how the genomic evolution is manifested in cancer drug responsiveness. This approach could facilitate tailoring of drugs and drug combinations to individual patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Precision medicine guided by comprehensive genome sequencing represents a potential treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer. However, clinical sequencing for pancreatic cancer entails several practical difficulties. We have launched an in-house clinical sequencing system and started genomic testing for patients with cancer in clinical practice. We have analyzed the clinical utility of this system in pancreatic cancer.(#br)METHODS(#br)We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with pancreatic cancer who visited our division. Genomic DNA was extracted from both tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the patients. We performed a comprehensive genomic testing using targeted amplicon sequencing for 160 cancer-related genes. The primary endpoints were the detection rates of potential actionable and druggable gene alterations. The secondary endpoints were the detection rate of secondary germline findings, the rate of re-biopsy required for genome sequencing, survival time after the initial visit (post-sequencing survival time), and turnaround time.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Although re-biopsy was required for 25% (5/20) of all patients, genomic testing was performed in all patients. Actionable and druggable gene alterations were detected in 100% (20/20) and 35% (7/20) of patients, respectively, whereas secondary germline findings were detected in 5% (1/20) of patients. The median turnaround times for physicians and patients were 20 and 26 days, respectively. The median post-sequencing survival time was 10.3 months. Only 10% (2/20) of all patients were treated with therapeutic agents based on the outcomes of genomic testing.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)The clinical application of comprehensive genomic testing for pancreatic cancer was feasible and promising in clinical practice.]]>

          <![CDATA[BACKGROUND(#br)Although large-scale, next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies of cancers hold promise for enabling precision oncology, challenges remain in integrating NGS with clinically validated biomarkers.(#br)METHODS(#br)To overcome such challenges, we utilized the Database of Evidence for Precision Oncology (DEPO) to link druggability to genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic biomarkers. Using a pan-cancer cohort of 6570 tumors, we identified tumors with potentially druggable biomarkers consisting of drug-associated mutations, mRNA expression outliers, and protein/phosphoprotein expression outliers identified by DEPO.(#br)RESULTS(#br)Within the pan-cancer cohort of 6570 tumors, we found that 3% are druggable based on FDA-approved drug-mutation interactions in specific cancer types. However, mRNA/phosphoprotein/protein expression outliers and drug repurposing across cancer types suggest potential druggability in up to 16% of tumors. The percentage of potential drug-associated tumors can increase to 48% if we consider preclinical evidence. Further, our analyses showed co-occurring potentially druggable multi-omics alterations in 32% of tumors, indicating a role for individualized combinational therapy, with evidence supporting mTOR/PI3K/ESR1 co-inhibition and BRAF/AKT co-inhibition in 1.6 and 0.8% of tumors, respectively. We experimentally validated a subset of putative druggable mutations in BRAF identified by a protein structure-based computational tool. Finally, analysis of a large-scale drug screening dataset lent further evidence supporting repurposing of drugs across cancer types and the use of expression outliers for inferring druggability.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)Our results suggest that an integrated analysis platform can nominate multi-omics alterations as biomarkers of druggability and aid ongoing efforts to bring precision oncology to patients.]]>

          <![CDATA[OBJECTIVES(#br)The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently altered in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), making this pathway a logical therapeutic target. However, PI3K targeting is not universally effective. Biomarkers of response are needed to stratify patients likely to derive benefit and exclude those unlikely to respond.(#br)MATERIALS AND METHODS(#br)We examined the sensitivity of cell lines with constitutively-active (G12V mutant) HRAS and wild-type HRAS to PI3K inhibition using flow cytometry and cell viability assays. We then overexpressed and silenced HRAS and measured sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor BYL719. Immunoblotting was used to determine activation of the PI3K pathway. MEK and mTOR inhibitors were then tested in HRAS mutant cells to determine their efficacy.(#br)RESULTS(#br)HRAS mutant cell lines were non-responsive to PI3K inhibition. Overexpression of HRAS led to reduced susceptibility to PI3K inhibition, while knockdown improved sensitivity. Immunoblotting revealed suppressed AKT phosphorylation upon PI3K inhibition in both wild-type and HRAS mutant cell lines, however mutant lines maintained phosphorylation of S6, downstream of mTOR. Targeting mTOR effectively reduced viability of HRAS mutant cells and we subsequently examined the ERK-TSC2-mTOR cascade as a mediator of resistance to PI3K inhibition.(#br)CONCLUSIONS(#br)HRAS mutant cells are resistant to PI3K inhibition and our findings suggest the involvement of a signalling intersection of the MAPK and PI3K pathways at the level of ERK-TSC2, leading to persistent mTOR activity. mTOR inhibition alone or in combination with MAPK pathway inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy for this subset of HNSCC tumors.]]>

          <![CDATA[The aim of the present study was to understand whether modeling brain function in terms of network structure makes it possible to find markers of prediction of motor learning performance in a sensory motor learning task. By applying graph theory indexes of brain segregation - such as modularity and transitivity - to functional connectivity data derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, we further studied pre- (baseline) versus post-task brain network architecture to understand whether motor learning induces changes in functional brain connectivity. The results showed that, after the training session with measurable learning, transitivity increased in the alpha1 EEG frequency band and modularity increased in the theta band and decreased in the gamma band, suggesting that brain segregation is modulated by the cognitive task. Furthermore, it was observed that theta modularity at the baseline negatively correlated with the performance improvement; namely, the lower this connectivity index at the baseline pre-task period, the higher the improvement of performance with training. The present results show that brain segregation is modulated by the cognitive task and that it is possible to predict performance by the study of pre-task EEG rhythm connectivity parameters.]]>

          <![CDATA[Glioma is the most common type of malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Studies of the biological mechanism behind its occurrence and development have significant importance in better understanding glioma. In the era of multiomics and big data, glioma research is undergoing a paradigm shift from traditional standardized medical models to precision medicine. Big data in glioma research is in its infancy, and as such, there are exciting opportunities to take advantage of. However, there are also major challenges that must be addressed. This review introduces a series of changes in glioma research brought about by medical big data. It further elaborates on how big data bioinformatic analyzes can contribute to the identification of molecular targets, leading to molecular pathological diagnosis and the promotion of precision medicine of glioma.]]>

                 <![CDATA[疾病的发生常常与蛋白质的异常表达有关,精准医疗可以精确寻找到病因和治疗靶点,实现疾病和患者的个性化精准治疗。纳米孔传感技术,可以从单分子层面检测蛋白质的变化,有效提高患者病因诊断的准确率,缩短治疗周期。本课题使用纳米孔单分子传感器件分别对单个蛋白质分子以及蛋白质相互作用关系开展了实验研究。主要研究内容如下:1)蛋白质的基本物理特性。研究发现,牛血清白蛋白BSA分子在通过纳米孔时比链状DNA分子更容易与纳米孔壁发生粘附作用。纳米孔实验可以用来估算蛋白质分子的直径。2)电解质溶液性质(种类/浓度/酸碱度)对蛋白质易位的影响。研究发现,电解质溶液的种类及浓度将会直接改变溶液环境中蛋白质的带电量,进而影响蛋白质的过孔时间。电解质溶液的酸碱度不仅会改变蛋白质的带电量还会改变蛋白质的电荷属性。3)蛋白质分子在外加电场作用下的构型变化。结合COMSOL静电场模拟,可以发现:低电压下,BSA分子在捕获域及纳米孔内均为天然态;中电压下,BSA分子在捕获域内为天然态,在孔内第一次被解折叠;高电压下,BSA分子在捕获域内第一次被解折叠,在孔内进一步被解折叠。4)抗体的免疫测定以及抗原抗体特异性结合的监测。研究发现,固态纳米孔不仅可以用来检测抗体分子来评估疫苗的效价,而且可以实现抗原、抗体以及两者结合物这三种分子在纳米尺度下的辨识。5)癌症免疫检查点抑制剂有效性的评估。实验制备并表征了经PD-1抗体修饰的氮化硅薄膜纳米孔,分别使用已修饰和未修饰抗体分子的纳米孔对PD-1抗原分子进行检测,证实了PD-1蛋白与其抗体实现了免疫结合,即说明了抑制剂药物的有效性。最后通过调节温度参数提高了抗原与抗体的结合率。]]>

                 <![CDATA[Human diseases sometimes are resulted from proteins' abnormal expression in bodies.Precision medicine is capable of finding out the pathogeny accurately and realizing the accurate treatment for patients.The nanopore sensing device,one of the single-molecule detection methods,makes precision diagnosis possible.By detecting protein molecules in vitro using nanopore,the diagnostic accuracy is improved and the treatment cycle of patients is shorten.In this thesis,the nanopore sensors are used to study both the single protein and protein-protein interaction.The main research results are as follows:1)The basic physical properties of proteins were studied.It was found that the BSA(bovine serum albumin)molecules are easier to adhere to the nanopore wall than the strand DNA molecules.The diameter of the protein molecules could be estimated by nanopore.2)The effect of electrolyte solution properties on protein translocation were studied.It was found that the type and concentration of electrolyte solution could directly change the protein charges,and then delay or shorten the passing time.The pH of the electrolyte solution not only changes the protein charges,but also determines the charges is positive or negative.3)The unfolding process of protein under increasing voltage was studied.Combined with COMSOL simulation,it was found that the BSA molecules keep natural folded state both in capture area and in the pore at low voltage.At mediate voltage,the BSA molecules kept folded in capture area and were started to be unfolded in the pore.At high voltage,the BSA molecules were began to be unfolded firstly in capture area and further to be unfolded in the pore.4)The antibody molecules were detected and the specific immunological binding between antigen and antibody was monitored.Results were showed that the nanopore sensors could not only be used to detect antibody molecules,but also be used to distinguish the antigen,antibody and their specific binding.5)The efficiency of cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors in blocking the signal pathway between cancer cells and T-cells was evaluated.Using PD-1 antibody modified nanopore,the antibody-antigen complexes were detected and distinguished with PD-1 protein and its antibody.Finally,the temperature of the buffer solution was increased to inprove the binding rate of the antigen and antibody.]]>

                 <![CDATA[研究背景和目的:结肠癌是常见的消化道恶性肿瘤之一。世界范围内其发病率、死亡率居所有恶性肿瘤的第3位。近年亚洲国家结肠癌发病率呈明显上升趋势。我国最新的肿瘤流行病学数据显示其发病率居第4位,死亡率居第5位。左右半结肠癌生物学行为的不同很早就被临床所关注。1990年Bufill等学者首次提出左半结肠癌(LCC)和右半结肠癌(RCC)是两种不同肿瘤,在解剖结构生理功能、临床病理特征、致癌机制等方面阐明了两者差异。EGFR是经过临床证实的跟结直肠癌密切相关的治疗靶点,用于结肠癌精准治疗。KRAS基因是EGFR信号通路中一个重要调控基因,突变时会使结肠癌患者对抗EGFR抗体类药物产生耐药。2016版NCCN明确规定:一、所有结肠癌患者都应该检测Kras基因状态;二、Kras基因野生型患者才建议使用EGFR抑制剂进行治疗。因此KRAS基因突变检测是目前筛选抗EGFR靶向药物治最有效最直接的方法。左右半结肠癌临床病理特征及与KRAS基因相关性分析,国内报道不一致,大都来自非随机的,小样本的回顾性研究,本研究意在揭示不同部位结肠癌的肿瘤生物学差异,尤其分子水平,为实现肿瘤个体化治疗及精准治疗提供理论依据。精准治疗的基础在于准确的检测结果。目前国内尚有实验室未开展该检测,已开展该检测科室采取方法并未完全统一.检测方法不同导致检测结果不一致,影响临床治疗及今后的研究。本文亦将对Sanger DNA测序法,、ARMS两种方法分析对比,以期为临床实验室KRAS基因突变规范性检测提供理论依据。研究方法:收集南方医科大学南方医院病理科2013-2016年间普外科接受手术治疗的236例结肠癌患者的临床病理资料:发病部位、临床病理诊断、性别、年龄、是否伴有腹痛、是否有肛周出血/大便潜血、肿瘤大小、肿瘤分化程度、TNM分期,最终选定198例标本统计分析。随机选取113例标本应用Sanger DNA测序法检测KRAS基因突变,对左右半结肠癌中KRAS基因突变类型、KRAS基因突变与临床病理特征相关性进行统计分析。再应用ARMS法对上述113例标本进行KRAS基因突变检测,统计分析两种方法学差异。统计软件为SPSS Statitics 20.0,采用卡方检验分析差异性,P<0.05为差异有统计学意义;采用Kappa 一致性检验分析两种检测方法一致性,Kappa≥0.75,说明一致性较好;0.4≤Kappa<0.75,说明一致性一般;Kappa<0.4,说明一致性较差。研究结果:1.左右半结肠癌临床病理特征与KRAS基因突变相关性(1)左右半结肠癌临床病理特征:肿瘤部位与患者的性别、年龄、大小、分化程度、是否肛周出血/大便潜血及M分期密切相关(P<0.05);结肠癌患者肿瘤原发部位与患者腹痛与否、T分期及N分期无相关性(P≥0.05)。(2)KRAS基因突变类型特征:113例结肠癌患者中,KRAS基因总突变率为34.5%(39/113)。其中 RCC 总突变率为 52.6%(20/38),明显高于 LCC25.3%(19/75)的突变率(P<0.05)。KRAS基因第12位密码子GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT)突变位点突变率在 RCC 为 26.3%(10/38),高于 LCC8.0%(6/75)的突变率(P<0.05)。其余四个位点突变率,结果显示并无相关性(P≥0.05)。检测到一例标本有GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT)和 GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC)双突变。(3)KRAS基因突变与临床病理相关性:113例标本KRAS基因突变率与肿瘤原发灶部位、分化程度、N分期密切相关(P<0.05);KRAS基因突变率与性别,年龄,肿瘤大小,T分期以及M分期无相关性(P≥0.05)。2.比较ARMS法和Sanger DNA测序法检测结肠癌KRAS基因突变:(1)总体突变率:ARMS法和Sanger DNA测序法突变率分别为47.8%(54/113)、34.5%(39/113),前者突变率显著高于后者,差异有统计学意义(P<0.05);两法检测结果经Kappa一致性检验,Kappa=0.679(0.4≤Kappa<0.75),表明一致性一般。(2)单碱基突变类型:ARMS 法检测到 GLY12ASP、GLY12ALA、GLY12VAL、GLY13ASP4种类型,Sanger DNA测序法检测到上述4种及GLY12CYS5种类型,ARMS法测到4种单碱基的突变率与Sanger DNA测序法此4种单碱基的突变率无相关性。(P≥0.05)。另有Sanger DNA测序法法能检测到4例GLY12CYS突变,ARMS法未检测到;有19例标本ARMS法检测结果阳性,Sanger DNA测序法检测结果阴性;一例标本用Sanger DNA测序法检测到GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT)和GLY13 ASP(GGC>GAC)双突变。结论:1.左右半结肠癌临床病理特征与KRAS基因突变相关性:左右半结肠癌在病理学特性方面截然不同,且与KRAS基因突变密切相关,因此,两者的治疗方案,治疗敏感性也不相同。鉴于此,RCC和LCC在诊断和治疗过程需要区别对待。2.ARMS法和Sanger DNA测序法各有优缺点,ARMS法能检测出的阳性病例更多,结果差异显著;Sanger DNA测序法能检测ARMS试剂盒未能检测突变位点。两法检测结果一致性较为理想。结合FDA批准方案,临床可首选ARMS法,对未能检测出突变位点,采取两种方法互补的复合检测方法,完善KRAS基因突变检出率。]]>

                 <![CDATA[Research background and purpose:Colon cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract.Worldwide,the incidence and mortality rate is third in all malignant tumors.In recent years,the incidence of colon cancer has increased significantly in Asian countries.The latest cancer epidemiology data in China show that the incidence rate is fourth,and the mortality rate is fifth.The biological behavior of left and right colon cancer has long been the focus of clinical attention.In 1990,De Groot et al.proposed dividing the colon into left-sided colon and right-sided colon.Also,he argued that LCC and RCC were two different cancers by elucidating the difference between LCC and RCC for the first time,involving difference in epidemiology and pathological and molecular characteristics,this finding shed light on the exploration of LCC and RCC for many scholars.It has clinically proven that epidermal growth factor(EGFR)is a therapeutic target closely associated with colon cancer and is used for colorectal cancer treatment.As a targeted therapeutic agent,EGFR inhibitor has shown obvious inhibition on colon cancer tumor growth.KRAS gene is an important regulatory gene in EGFR signaling pathway,while mutant-type KRAS gene reduces the function of EGFR antibody agent and leads to chemoresistance.2016 NCCN(National Comprehensive Cancer Network)has provided strict guidelines for molecular pathological diagnosis of mutant-type KRAS gene:1.It is necessary to detect the phenotype of KRAS gene of all CC patients.2.Only CC patients with wide-type KRAS gene were suggested for EGFR inhibitor(cetuximab and panitumumab)therapy.Therefore,KRAS gene mutation detection is the most direct and effective method for screening of anti-EGFR targeted drug.The clinicopathological features of left and right colon cancer and the correlation analysis with KRAS gene are not consistent in domestic reports.Most of them come from non random,small sample retrospective studies.This study aims to reveal tumor biological differences in different parts of colon cancer,especially molecular level,to provide a theory for the realization of individualized treatment and precise treatment of swelling tumors.Accurate treatment is based on accurate detection results.At present,there are still some laboratories in China that have not been tested in the laboratory,and the methods that have been carried out in the laboratory have not been completely unified.The different detection methods lead to the inconsistent results,which affect the clinical treatment and the future research.This article will also analyze and compare the two methods of Sanger DNA sequencing and ARMS,in order to provide a theoretical basis for the standardized detection of KRAS gene mutation in clinical laboratories.Methods:The clinicopathological data of 236 CC patients having surgery in general surgical department of Nanfang hospital were collected:site of tumor;clinicopathological diagnosis;sex;age;with or without abdominal pain;with or without crissum hemorrhage/fecal occult blood;tumor size;tumor differentiation degree,TNM stage;lymph node metastases is grouped by N0 and N1+N2;distant metastases is grouped by M0 and M1);198 CC patients were chosen for statistical analysis of clinicopathological data,aiming to find the difference of clinic-pathological features between LCC and RCC;198 chosen samples were made into formalin-fixed and parrffin-embedded specimens.113 samples were randomly selected to detect the mutation of KRAS gene by sequencing,and the correlation of KRAS gene mutation type,KRAS gene mutation and clinicopathological features in left and right colon cancer was analyzed.Then the ARMS method was used to detect the KRAS gene mutation in the 113 samples,and the two methodological differences were statistically analyzed.The statistical software is SPSS Statitics 20.0,and the analysis methods are chi square test and Kappa consistency test.The difference was statistically significant for P<0.05;the results of the two methods were Kappa consistency test and Kappa=0.679(0.4<Kappa<0.75),indicating consistency.Results:1.The correlation between clinic-pathological features and KRAS gene mutation in LCC and RCC.1)Clinic-pathological features of LCC and RCC.Among the 198 colon cancer cases,statistical analysis of the relationship between primary tumor site of colon cancer patients and pathological parameters showed that colon cancer tumor site is closely correlated with sex,age,tumor size,differentiation degree and distant metastases(P<0.05).Results of analysis showed no relevance between colon cancer primary tumor site and abdominal pain,T stage and N stage,the difference was not statistically significant(P≥0.05).2)KRAS mutation type in LCC and RCC.Among the randomly divided 113 colon cancer cases,the total mutation rate of KRAS gene was 34.5%(39/113),among which the single base mutation rate of RCC was 52.6(20/38)and LCC was 25.3%(19/75).RCC patients had higher single base mutation rate compared with LCC,and the difference was statistically significant(P<0.05).Further analysis showed that the mutation rate of codon 12 of KRAS gene GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT)in RCC was 26.3%(10/38)and LCC was 26.3%(10/38)lower than the rate in RCC(P<0.05).The difference was statistically significant(P<0.05).However,we observed no relevance when analyzing the mutation rate of GLY12 VAL(GGT>GTT),GLY12ALA(GGT>GCT),GLY12CYS(GGT>TGT)and GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC),the difference was not statistically significant(P≥ 0.05).In our study,we found no single base mutation type other than the five mentioned types,but we found double mutation of GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT)and GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC)in a specific specimen.3)The relevance between KRAS gene mutation and clinic-pathological features.After analyzing the relationship between KRAS gene mutation and colon cancer clinic-pathological features in 113 specimens,we found KRAS mutation rate is closely correlated with tumor primary site,tumor differentiation degree and lymph node metastases(N stage),which was statistically significant(P<0.05).Analysis of 113 specimens on the relationship between KRAS mutation and clinic-pathological features displayed that KRAS mutation rates were various in CC patients with different sex,age(<60 years or ≥60 years),tumor size(<5cm or ≥5cm),tumor invasion depth(T1+T2,T3+T4)and with or without distant metastases(M0,M1).but none of them was statistically significant(P>0.05).2.Comparison of ARMS method and Sanger DNA sequencing method on detection of KRAS mutation in CC.1)Detect KRAS gene overall mutation rate using the two methods.KRAS mutation rate of 113 specimens were determined applying ARMS method and Sanger DNA sequencing method,and the positive rare were 47.8%(54/113)and 34.5%(39/113)respectively.The positive coincidence rate of the two methods was 72.2%(39/54).Obviously,KRAS mutation rate detected by ARMS method were higher than Sanger DNA sequencing method,the difference was statistically significant(P<0.05).2)Detect single base mutation types of KRAS gene utilizing the two methods.In our study,we detected 5 types of single base mutation types of KRAS gene using both methods,they were GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT),GLY12ALA(GGT>GCT),GLY12VAL(GGT>GTT),GLY12CYS(GGT>TGT),GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC).Among the above types,GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT),GLY12ALA(GGT>GCT),GLY12VAL(GGT>GTT),GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC)can be determined by ARMS method.GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT),GLY12ALA(GGT>GCT),GLY12VAL(GGT>GTT),GLY12CYS(GGT>TGT),GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC)can be detected by Sanger DNA sequencing method.Detection of Sanger sequencing to above 4 GLY12CYS and a total of 5 types,ARMS detected 4 single base mutation rate of Sanger DNA sequencing method of the 4 kinds of single nucleotide mutation rate had no correlation(P>0.05).Moreover,we successfully detected the mutation site of GLY12CYS(GGT>TGT)using Sanger DNA sequencing method with 4 positive cases,whereas ARMS method failed to detect this mutation site.Meanwhile,19 positive specimens diagnosed by ARMS method were negative when using Sanger DNA sequencing method.Among them,9 cases were GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT),4 cases were GLY12VAL(GGT>GTT),1 case was GLY12ALA(GGT>GCT)and 5 cases were GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC).Intriguingly,one specimen was diagnosed with two mutation of GLY12ASP(GGT>GAT)and GLY13ASP(GGC>GAC),which can be detected by both ARMS method and Sanger DNA sequencing method.The results of the two methods were consistent with Kappa consistency test and Kappa=0.679.Conclusion:1.The relevance between KRAS gene mutation and clinic-pathological features in LCC and RCC.The clinic-pathological features of LCC and RCC are quite different,and are closely correlated with KRAS gene mutation.Thus,there are great differences on the treatment strategies and therapeutic sensitivity between LCC and RCC.Based on this,we need to make a distinction between LCC and RCC during diagnosis and treatment.2.Both ARMS method and Sanger DNA sequencing method have advantages and disadvantages.ARMS method yields more positive outcomes and distinct results,while Sanger DNA sequencing method can detect the mutation site which is undetectable for ARMS kit.The consistency of the two detection methods is satisfactory.Based on FDA approval scheme,ARMS is the first choice for clinical detection of KRAS gene in CC surgical specimens,although this method fails to detect some mutation sites.Departments with sequencing facility can supplement the detection via direct sequencing.Taken together,combining these two complementary methods will improve and perfect the detection rate of KRAS gene mutation.]]>
