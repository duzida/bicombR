AB Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most prevalent and fatal cancers.
   Studying the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) alterations in hepatocellular
   carcinoma may lead to new therapeutic strategies. We checked whether
   there were correlations between The Cancer Genome Atlas expression
   profiles of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and their DNA
   methylation status or the copy number variations for hepatocellular
   carcinoma. We obtained 41 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed
   between tumor and normal samples, and their DNA methylation status was
   negatively correlated with the expression levels. We identified five
   lncRNAs that were recurrently amplified or deleted in tumor samples, but
   none of them were associated with the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression
   levels. To obtain the biological function of these lncRNAs, the
   coexpressed mRNAs in the hepatocellular carcinoma were figured out. A
   total of 10 lncRNAs were highly correlated with at least one gene. Six
   out of the ten lncRNAs were already known to be related with cancer
   previously. LINC01615 had 72 coexpressed genes, and we carried out the
   gene ontology (GO) term enrichment for these protein-coding genes. The
   results suggested that these lncRNAs were associated with extracellular
   matrix organization. To summarize, we identified 41 potentially
   cancer-related lncRNAs. In particular, we proposed that LINC01615
   potentially affected the extracellular matrix and had further impacts on
   the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB ObjectiveBreast cancer (BC) is a malignant tumor which threat to women's
   physical and mental health. However, the mechanism of metabolism
   alteration in BC remains unclear. This study is intended to figure out
   the relationship between the alternation of metabolism and the
   progression of BC.
   MethodsIn this study, metabolites of plasma in 60 BC patients and 40
   healthy volunteers were detected using liquid chromatography mass
   spectrometer (LC-MS). Transcriptomic data were obtained from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was performed to
   enrich the pathways.
   ResultsA total of 97 metabolites have been identified and measured, of
   which 17 compounds exhibited the differential expression between tumor
   group and control group (p<0.05; FDR<0.05). Metabolites set enrichment
   analysis (MSEA) displayed that there were 12 significantly enriched
   pathways in all. Through the KEGG database, 382 genes were found closely
   correlated with the altered metabolic pathways. TCGA and GEO
   transcriptomic profiling revealed that 5,018 genes significantly changed
   between tumor group and control group. Integrating these genes with the
   transcriptomic data from the corresponding KEGG data set, we identified
   most of the differential expressed genes were related to purine
   metabolism. A total of 28 different expression genes were hub genes,
   wherein AMPD1 and RRM2 were significantly effective in the prediction of
   survival of BC patients, with 0.04 and 0.02, respectively.
   ConclusionsCombining with the transcriptomic and metabolomics data, we
   found that the dysregulation of purine metabolism pathway might affect
   the progression of BC.

AB Breast cancer remains the second cause of tumor-related mortality in
   women worldwide mainly due to chemoresistance and metastasis. The
   chemoresistance and metastasis are attributed to a rare subpopulation
   with enriched stem-like characteristics, thus called Cancer Stem Cells
   (CSCs). We have previously reported aberrant expression of the
   actin-bundling protein (fascin) in breast cancer cells, which enhances
   their chemoresistance, metastasis and enriches CSC population. The
   intracellular mechanisms that link fascin with its downstream effectors
   are not fully elucidated. Here, loss and gain of function approaches in
   two different breast cancer models were used to understand how fascin
   promotes disease progression. Importantly, findings were aligned with
   expression data from actual breast cancer patients. Expression profiling
   of a large breast cancer dataset (TCGA, 530 patients) showed
   statistically significant correlation between fascin expression and a
   key adherence molecule, beta1 integrin (ITGB1). In vitro manipulation of
   fascin expression in breast cancer cells exhibited its direct effect on
   ITGB1 expression. Fascin-mediated regulation of ITGB1 was critical for
   several breast cancer cell functions including adhesion to different
   extracellular matrix, self-renewability and chemoresistance.
   Importantly, there was a significant relationship between fascin and
   ITGB1 co-expression and short disease-free as well as overall survival
   in chemo-treated breast cancer patients. This novel role of fascin
   effect on ITGB1 expression and its outcome on cell self-renewability and
   chemoresistance strongly encourages for dual targeting of fascin-ITGB1
   axis as a therapeutic approach to halt breast cancer progression and
   eradicate it from the root.

AB Testicular germ cell tumors are the most frequent malignancies found in
   men between 15 and 44years old. Although cellular apoptosis
   susceptibility (CAS) was demonstrated to be upregulated in breast cancer
   and colon cancer, the expression of CAS in the human testis and
   testicular germ cell tumors remained elusive. In the present study,
   CAS-positive signals were detected in the normal testicular tissues,
   cancer adjacent normal testicular tissues, seminoma, yolk sac tumor, and
   teratoma. Interestingly, the expression level of CAS in testicular germ
   cell tumors (TGCTs) (but not seminoma) was significantly lower than that
   of human testicular tissues and cancer adjacent normal testicular
   tissues, suggesting that decreased CAS contributed to the progression of
   TGCTs. Notably, the expression of CAS in seminoma was significantly
   higher than that of in the non-seminomas, consistent with the results
   from TCGA database. Furthermore, the localization of CAS is mainly
   restricted in the nucleus in the lesions of normal human testicular
   tissue and cancer adjacent normal testicular tissue. Although the
   expression of CAS was not significantly different between normal
   testicular tissue and seminoma, CAS was more enriched in cytoplasm in
   seminoma compared to the normal, cancer adjacent tissue and other types
   of TGCTs. The current results demonstrated reduced expression of CAS in
   the human testicular germ cell tumors and the CAS translocation from the
   nuclear to cytoplasm in seminoma, thereby supporting a possible role in
   normal testis function and in the development of seminoma.

AB This study aimed to identify critical prognostic molecular markers in
   Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and construct nomogram-based
   model for prognostic prediction. The RNA-sequencing profiles and
   corresponding clinical information were downloaded from TCGA database.
   Differential expressed genes (DEG) were screened using limma package,
   subsequently following by GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Univariate and
   multivariate cox regression analysis were performed to screen critical
   DEGs. Nomogram-based prediction model were constructed to identify
   clinical factors with independent prognostic values, and the accuracy of
   this model was validated. A total of 214 DEGs were identified from
   relapse AML samples compared with non-relapse samples. These DEGs were
   mainly involved in twenty GO terms and three signaling pathways, such as
   chromatin assembly or disassembly, cytokine-cytokine receptor
   interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Among these genes,
   Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis results showed that
   relapse and risk score were significantly correlated with survival
   outcomes. Finally, the accuracy ability of nomogram-based prediction
   model was validated. These six DEGs (ABCA5, CYP7A1, HERC5, etc.) play
   major roles in AMLs progression. Our nomogram-based prognostic
   predictive model might be an effective method to estimate survival
   probability of AML patients with different risk status.

AB Purpose: The present study aimed to identify the molecular mechanism of
   acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and explore valuable prognostic
   biomarkers for relapsed ALL.
   Methods: Gene expression dataset including 59 samples from ALL survivals
   without recurrence (good group) and 114 samples from dead ALL patients
   died of recurrence (poor group) was downloaded from TCGA database. The
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between good and
   poor groups, followed by pathway and functional enrichment analyses.
   Subsequently, logistic regression model and survival analysis were
   performed.
   Results: In total, 637 up- and 578 down-regulated DEGs were revealed
   between good and poor groups. These DEGs were mainly enriched in
   functions including transcription and pathways like focal adhesion.
   Genes including alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1), zinc finger protein 695
   (ZNF695), actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), calreticulin (CALR), and F-Box and
   leucine rich repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) were outstanding in survival
   analysis.
   Conclusion: Transcription and focal adhesion might play important roles
   in ALL progression. Furthermore, genes including ALPK1, ZNF695, ACTN4,
   CALR, and FBXL5 might be novel prognostic genes for relapsed ALL.

AB Identification of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression quantitative
   trait loci (lncR-eQTL) that associated with lung cancer can provide
   insights into regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA, and help reveal the role
   of lncRNA in lung cancer. A two-stage case-control design was
   implemented in this study. We first selected the lncRNAs that
   differently expressed based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project
   (75 normal and 708 tumor tissues) and identified eQTLs for selected
   lncRNAs based on data of 278 normal lung tissues from the the
   genotype-tissue expression database. Then we selected lncR-eQTLs that
   associated with lung cancer based on two lung cancer GWAS datasets (7127
   cases and 6818 controls). Promising lncR-eQTLs were further replicated
   in an additional population (1056 cases and 1053 controls). Functional
   annotations of the identified lncR-eQTLs and related lncRNAs were
   finally performed by using multiple public databases. Our eQTL analysis
   finally detected three lncRNA-eQTLs, rs793544 in 3q13.12 (odds ratio
   [OR]=1.15; confidence interval [CI]:1.09-1.22; P=2.30*10-6 ), rs7234707
   in 18p11.31 (OR= 1.1; CI:1.05-1.15; P=9.01*10-5 ) and rs1600249 in
   8p23.1 (OR=1.1; CI:1.05-1.16; P=1.27*10-4 ), that were consistently
   associated with the risk of lung cancer. These findings indicate that
   lncR-eQTLs may serve as novel susceptibility markers for lung cancer.

AB Circadian rhythm describes the 24-h oscillation in physiology and
   behavior of living organisms and presents a timing controller for life
   activity. Studies in recent years have reported that the abnormal
   expression of clock genes is closely related to the development of
   common abdominal malignant tumors. The expression of the 14 kinds of
   clock genes in 6 abdominal malignant tumors from Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) data was integrated and analyzed using R and Perl programming
   languages to show the association between clock gene expression and
   prognosis of cancer patients. Analysis of TCGA data indicated that the
   overexpression of Per1-3, Cry2, CLOCK, NR1D2 and RORA with
   underexpression of Timeless and NPAS2 was associated with a favorable
   prognosis in kidney cancer. In liver cancer, high expressions of Cry2
   and RORA were correlated with prolonged overall survival (OS) in
   patients, while high expressions of NPAS2 and Timeless were correlated
   with a poor survival. High expression of CLOCK was positively correlated
   with OS in colon cancer patients. High expression of Cry2 and low
   expression of DEC1 were associated with a favorable prognosis in
   pancreatic cancer patients, respectively. Most of these clock-genes
   expressions were closely related to the clinical stage and degree of
   tumor differentiation of patients. Aberrant clock gene expression is
   related to the biological characteristics of abdominal malignant tumors,
   which likely has a causal role in cancer development and survival.

AB Thyroid cancer is associated with one of the most malignant endocrine
   tumors. However, molecular mechanisms underlying thyroid tumorigenesis
   and progression remain unclear. In order to investigate these
   mechanisms, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing, which indicated
   that a differentially expressed gene, METTL7B, was highly expressed in
   thyroid cancers. We analyzed METTL7B expression using TCGA and performed
   qRT-PCR on tissue samples. Moreover, an analysis of clinicopathological
   characteristics revealed a positive correlation between METTL7B and
   lymph node metastasis. A series of in vitro experiments indicated that
   METTL7B enhanced migration and invasion of thyroid carcinoma cells.
   Further studies revealed that METTL7B may enhance TGF-beta1-induced
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our results indicate that
   METTL7B may promote metastasis of thyroid cancer through EMT and may
   therefore be considered as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and
   prognosis of thyroid carcinoma.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver
   cancer, and can be induced by hepatitisB virus (HBV) infection. The aim
   of the present study was to screen prognosis‑associated long noncoding
   RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The
   RNA‑sequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100HCC samples and
   26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were
   downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with
   weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, the identification and
   functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE
   package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DE‑RNAs) were
   analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosis‑associated lncRNAs
   and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival
   and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the
   nodes in an lncRNA‑mRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment
   Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051consensus DE‑RNAs were
   identified. The stable modules were significantly associated with the
   histological grades of HCC, tumor, node and metastasis stage,
   pathological stage, recurrence and exposure to radiation therapy. A
   9‑lncRNA optimal combination [DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene9,
   glucosidase, beta, acid3 (GBA3), HLA complex group4, N‑acetyltransferase
   8B, neighbor of breast cancer1 gene2, prostate androgen‑regulated
   transcript1, ret finger protein like1 antisense RNA 1, solute carrier
   family22 member18 antisense and T‑cell leukemia/lymphoma 6] was selected
   from the 14 prognosis‑associated lncRNAs, and was further supported by
   the validation dataset, GSE10186. The lncRNA‑mRNA co‑expression network
   revealed lncRNA GBA3 as a positive regulator of phosphoenolpyruvate
   carboxykinase 2, an important enzyme in the metabolic pathway of
   gluconeogenesis. A risk score system was established based on the
   optimal 9 lncRNAs, which may be valuable for predicting the prognosis of
   patients with HBV‑positive HCC and improving understanding of mechanisms
   associated with the pathogenesis of this disease. On the contrary, a
   larger, independent cohort of patients is required to further validate
   the risk‑score system.

AB Large‑scale projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human
   Epigenome Project (HEP) and Human Epigenome Atlas (HEA), provide an
   insight into DNA methylation and histone modification markers. Changes
   in the epigenome significantly contribute to the initiation and
   progression of cancer. The goal of the present study was to characterize
   the prostate cancer malignant transformation model using the CpG island
   methylation pattern. The Human Prostate Cancer EpiTect Methyl II
   Signature PCR Array was used to evaluate the methylation status of 22
   genes in prostate cancer cell lines: PC3, PC3M, PC3MPro4 and PC3MLN4,
   each representing different metastatic potential in vivo. Subsequently,
   it was ascertained whether DNA methylation plays a role in the
   expression of these genes in prostate cancer cells. Hypermethylation of
   APC, DKK3, GPX3, GSTP1, MGMT, PTGS2, RASSF1, TIMP2 and TNFRSF10D
   resulted in downregulation of their expression in prostate cancer cell
   lines as compared to WT fibroblasts. Mining of the TCGA data deposited
   in the MetHC database found increases in the methylation status of these
   9 genes in prostate cancer patients, further supporting the role of
   methylation in altering the expression of these genes in prostate
   cancer. Future studies are warranted to investigate the role of these

AB Homeodomain‑containing gene 10 (HOXC10) is a member of the homeobox
   transcription factors that plays an important role in the development of
   multicellular organisms. HOXC10 is overexpressed in a variety of human
   cancers, and recent studies have revealed that HOXC10 is upregulated in
   gastric cancer as well. However, its mechanism of action is not fully
   understood, thus, the role of HOXC10 was investigated in the present
   study in human gastric cancer. First, HOXC10 expression was revealed to
   be significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal
   tissues (TCGA dataset), and HOXC10 upregulation was associated with
   decreased recurrence‑free survival in gastric cancer patients in a
   public gene expression dataset. HOXC10 promoted cell proliferation and
   metastasis in two gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and MKN74). Analyzing
   TCGA 450K DNA methylation dataset, it was revealed that HOXC10 CpG sites
   were hypomethylated in gastric cancer tissues. Bisulfite sequencing
   revealed that CpG sites in the HOXC10 first intronic region were
   hypomethylated in three gastric cancer tissues, and HOXC10 expression
   was increased in gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and SNU620) in response
   to 5‑azacytidine treatment. By RNA‑sequencing of AGS cells with ectopic
   HOXC10 expression, it was revealed that many genes were upregulated by
   HOXC10 overexpression. Among them, CST1 was predicted to be a HOXC10
   direct target gene via prediction of HOXC10 binding sites from the
   JASPAR database. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that
   HOXC10 directly bound to CST1 promoter regions. The present study
   proposes HOXC10 is a potential prognostic marker or therapeutic target
   in human gastric cancer.

AB The present study aimed to identify novel methylation markers of clear
   cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) using microarray methylation analysis
   and evaluate their prognostic relevance in patient samples. To identify
   cancer‑specific methylated biomarkers, microarray profiling of ccRCC
   samples from our institute (n=12) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database (n=160) were utilized, and the prognostic relevance of
   candidate genes were investigated in another TCGA dataset (n=153). For
   validation, pyrosequencing analyses with ccRCC samples from our
   institute (n=164) and another (n=117) were performed and the potential
   clinical application of selected biomarkers was examined. We identified
   22 CpG island loci that were commonly hypermethylated in ccRCC.
   Kaplan‑Meier analysis of TCGA data indicated that only 4/22 loci were
   significantly associated with disease progression. In the internal
   validation set, Kaplan‑Meier analysis revealed that hypermethylation of
   two loci, zinc finger protein 492 (ZNF492) and G protein‑coupled
   receptor 149 (GPR149), was significantly associated with shorter
   time‑to‑progression. Multivariate Cox regression models revealed that
   hypermethylation of ZNF492 [hazard ratio (HR), 5.44; P=0.001] and GPR149
   (HR, 7.07; P<0.001) may be independent predictors of tumor progression.
   Similarly, the methylation status of these two genes was significantly
   associated with poor outcomes in the independent external validation
   cohort. Collectively, the present study proposed that the novel
   methylation markers ZNF492 and GPR149 could be independent prognostic
   indicators in patients with ccRCC.

AB Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells form angiogenesis‑independent
   vessel‑like structures to survive, known as vasculogenic mimicry(VM),
   contributing to a poor prognosis for cancer patients. Nuclear localized
   classI histone deacetylases(HDACs) enzymes, particularly HDACs1, 2, 3
   deacetylate chromatin histones, are overexpressed in cancers and
   epigenetically regulate the expression of genes involved in cancer
   initiation and progression. The specific HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, has
   been shown to attenuate tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. In
   this study, we hypothesized that entinostat would enhance the expression
   of anti‑angiogenic and tumor suppressor genes and would thus suppress VM
   structures in TNBC cells in a 3DMatrigel cell culture preclinical model.
   Our data indicated that invasive triple‑negative MDA‑MB‑231, LM2‑4 and
   BT‑549 breast cancer cells, but not poorly invasive luminal MCF‑7 cells,
   efficiently underwent matrix‑associated VM formation. Approximately 80%
   of TNBC cells with the stem cell phenotype potential formed vessel‑like
   structures when mixed with Matrigel and cultured in the low attachment
   tissue culture plate. The molecular mechanisms of VM formation are
   rather complex, while angiogenesis inhibitor genes are downregulated and
   pro‑angiogenesis genes are upregulated in VM‑forming cells. Our data
   revealed that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat
   epigenetically led to the re‑expression of the anti‑angiogenic genes,
   serpin familyF member1(SERPINF1) and thrombospondin2(THBS2), and to that
   of the tumor suppressor genes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and
   p21, and reduced VM structures. We also found that treatment of the TNBC
   VM phenotype cells with entinostat downregulated the expression of
   vascular endothelial growth factorA(VEGF‑A), and that of the
   epithelial‑mesenchymal transition(EMT)‑related genes, Vimentin and
   beta‑catenin. METABIRC and TCGA breast cancer cohort mRNA expression
   data analysis revealed that a high expression of the
   anti‑angiogenesis‑associated genes, THBS2, SERPINF1 and serpin familyB
   member5(SERPINB5), and of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, was
   associated with a better overall survival(OS) of breast cancer patients.
   Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrate that HDACs1, 2, 3
   partly contribute to VM formation in TNBC cells; thus, HDACs may be an
   important therapeutic target for TNBC.

AB Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of renal tumor, and
   the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most frequent
   subtype. In this study, our aim is to identify potential biomarkers that
   could effectively predict the prognosis and progression of ccRCC. First,
   we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data of
   ccRCC to identify 2370 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Second,
   the DEGs were used to construct a coexpression network by weighted gene
   coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Moreover, we identified the
   yellow module, which was strongly related to the histologic grade and
   pathological stage of ccRCC. Then, the functional annotation of the
   yellow module and single-samples gene-set enrichment analysis of DEGs
   were performed and mainly enriched in cell cycle. Subsequently, 18
   candidate hub genes were screened through WGCNA and protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) network analysis. After verification of TCGA's ccRCC
   data set, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data set (GSE73731) and tissue
   validation, we finally identified 15 hub genes that can actually predict
   the progression of ccRCC. In addition, by using survival analysis, we
   found that patients of ccRCC with high expression of each hub gene were
   more likely to have poor prognosis than those with low expression. The
   receiver operating characteristic curve showed that each hub gene could
   effectively distinguish between localized and advanced ccRCC. In
   summary, our study indicates that 15 hub genes have great predictive
   value for the prognosis and progression of ccRCC, and may contribute to
   the exploration of the pathogenesis of ccRCC.

AB The abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) or protein-coding genes
   (PCGs) have been found to be associated with the prognosis of
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Using bioinformatics analysis
   methods including Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis, the
   random survival forest algorithm, Kaplan-Meier, and receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we mined the gene expression
   profiles of 469 HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n=379) and
   Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE14520; n=90) public database. We selected a
   signature comprising one protein-coding gene (PCG; DNA polymerase ) and
   three miRNAs (hsa-miR-149-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-579-5p) with
   highest accurate prediction (area under the ROC curve [AUC]=0.72; n=189)
   from the training data set. The signature stratified patients into high-
   and low-risk groups with significantly different survival (median 27.9
   vs. 55.2 months, log-rank test, p<0.001) in the training data set, and
   its risk stratification ability were validated in the test data set
   (median 47.4 vs. 84.4 months, log-rank test, p=0.03) and an independent
   data set (median 31.0 vs. 46.0 months, log-rank test, p=0.01).
   Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the signature was an
   independent prognostic factor. And the signature was proved to have a
   better survival prediction power than tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage
   (AUC (signature)=0.72/0.64/0.62 vs. AUC (TNM)=0.65/0.61/0.61; p<0.05).
   Moreover, we validated the expression of these prognostic genes from the
   PCG-miRNA signature in Huh-7 cell by real-time polymerase chain
   reaction. In conclusion, we found a signature that can predict survival
   of HCC patients and serve as a prognostic marker for HCC.

AB MiR-137 has been identified as potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   prognostic biomarkers. Highly relevant HCC prognostic biomarkers may be
   derived from combinations of miR-137 with its target genes involved in
   the regulation of liver microenvironment. This study aimed at the
   discovery of such a combination with improved HCC prognosis performance
   than miR-137 or its target gene alone in a significantly higher number
   of HCC patients than previous studies. Analysis of the differentially
   expressed micro RNAs (miRNAs) between cancer and noncancer tissues
   reconfirmed miR-137 to be among the most relevant prognostic miRNAs and
   the data of 375 HCC patients and 50 normal cases were from the Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets. Target genes were identified by the
   established search methods and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of HCC
   patients was used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and
   recurrence-free survival (RFS). Cox proportional hazards regression
   indicated that the miR-137 and its target gene AFM combination is an
   independent prognostic factor for the OS and RFS in HCC. In vitro
   experiments validated that miR-137 could bind to 3-untranslated region
   of the AFM and promote the invasion and metastasis of HCC cell lines.
   The expressions of miR-137 and its liver microenvironment regulatory
   target gene AFM in combination significantly correlated with HCC
   progression in a higher number of patients than in previous studies,
   which suggested their potential as prognostic biomarkers for HCC.

AB DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of gene transcription in the
   etiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, it is
   reasonable to identify DNA methylation-related prognostic markers.
   Currently, we aimed to make an integrative epigenetic analysis of HCC to
   identify the effectiveness of epigenetic drivers in predicting prognosis
   for HCC patients. By the software pipeline TCGA-Assembler 2, RNA-seq,
   and methylation data were downloaded and processed from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas. A bioconductor package MethylMix was utilized to
   incorporate gene expression and methylation data on all 363 samples and
   identify 589 epigenetic drivers with transcriptionally predictive. By
   univariate survival analysis, 72 epigenetic drivers correlated with
   overall survival (OS) were selected for further analysis in our training
   cohort. By the robust likelihood-based survival model, six epi-drivers
   (doublecortin domain containing 2, flavin containing monooxygenase 3, G
   protein-coupled receptor 171, Lck interacting transmembrane adaptor 1,
   S100 calcium binding protein P, small nucleolar RNA host gene 6) serving
   as prognostic markers was identified and then a DNA methylation
   signature for HCC (MSH) predicting OS was identified to stratify
   patients into low-risk and high-risk groups in the training cohort
   (p<0.001). The capability of MSH was also assessed in the validation
   cohort (p=0.002). Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve
   confirmed MSH as an effective prognostic model for predicting OS in HCC
   patients in training area under curve (AUC=0.802) and validation
   (AUC=0.691) cohorts. Finally, a nomogram comprising MSH and pathologic
   stage was generated to predict OS in the training cohort, and it also
   operated effectively in the validation cohort (concordance index:
   0.674). In conclusion, MSH, a six epi-drivers based signature, is a
   potential model to predict prognosis for HCC patients.

AB The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/TNF receptor (TNFR) pathway is known to
   influence survival of patients with cancer. We hypothesize that single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNF/TNFR pathway genes related to
   apoptosis are associated with survival of patients with non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC). We used 1185 patients withNSCLC in the Prostate,
   Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and 984
   patients withNSCLC in the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study as
   the discovery and validation datasets, respectively. We selected 6788
   SNPs in 71 genes in the TNF/TNFR signaling pathway and extracted their
   genotyping data from the PLCO genowide-association study (GWAS) dataset.
   We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to evaluate
   associations between the identified SNPs and survival and validated the
   significant SNPs, which were further analyzed for their functional
   relevance. We found that genotypes of two validated SNPs, IKBKAP
   rs4978754 CT + TT and TNFRSF1B rs677844 TC + CC, as well as their
   combined genotypes predicted a better overall survival (P = 0.004, 0.002
   and <0.001, respectively). These two validated SNPs were predicted by
   the RegulomeDB score to be potentially functional. In addition, IKBKAP
   mRNA expression levels were significantly higher, while TNFRSF1B mRNA
   expression levels were significantly lower in lung cancer tissues than
   in adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA)-based expression quantitative trait loci analysis showed that
   IKBKAP rs4978754 and TNFRSF1B rs677844 genotypes were significantly
   associated with their corresponding mRNA expression levels in lung
   cancer tissues in a recessive model (P = 0.035 and 0.045, respectively).
   Therefore, we identified two potentially functional SNPs (IKBKAP
   rs4978754 C > T and TNFRSF1B rs677844 T > C) to be associated with
   survival of patients with NSCLC.

   classification remains a standard for treatment determination and
   predicting prognosis in thyroid cancer. The genes modules associated

   and differential expression analysis to systematically identified
   co-expressed gene modules and hub genes associated with PTC progression
   based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PTC transcriptome sequencing
   data. An independent validation cohort, GSE27155, was used to evaluate
   the preservation of gene modules. We identified two co-expressed genes
   modules associated with progression of PTC. Enrichment analysis
   indicated that the two modules were enriched in angiogenesis and
   extracellular matrix organization. DCN, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A2 and
   COL3A1 were hub genes in the co-expressed network. We systematically
   identified co-expressed gene modules and hub genes associated with PTC
   progression for the first time, which provided insights into the
   mechanisms underlying PTC progression and some potential targets for the

AB PURPOSE: Androgen receptor (AR) and AR signaling pathways are thought to
   play a role in breast cancer (BC) and are potentially related to
   treatment responses and outcomes. Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) is associated with AR
   stability in cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the
   clinicopathological utility of ANK3 expression with emphasis on AR and
   its associated signalling pathway at transcriptomic and proteomic
   phases.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer
   International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort (n=1980) and The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (n=1039) were used to assess the expression
   and significance of ANK3 mRNA and other AR signalling pathway-associated
   gene signature. Using immunohistochemistry, ANK3 protein expression was
   evaluated in large (n=982) cohort of early-stage BC with long-term
   follow-up and compared with clinicopathological characteristics and its
   prognostic value in the whole cohort and the subgroups stratified by AR
   protein expression.
   RESULTS: An AR-related gene signature was developed, comprising 20
   genes, which included ANK3. This AR-related gene signature was
   significantly associated with AR mRNA expression, oestrogen receptor,
   human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and the patients'
   outcomes. In tumours with high AR protein expression (n=614), high ANK3
   protein expression was significantly associated with progesterone
   receptor positivity and it was independently associated with the good
   outcomes (p=0.025).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that ANK3 is related to AR signalling
   pathway and is associated with BC prognosis.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is always accompanied by persistent
   inflammation of liver tissues, which is considered to exert
   protumourigenic effects by promoting cancer growth, progression, and
   metastasis. However, the tumour-promoting roles and predictive value of
   intratumoural inflammatory cytokines remain unclear. In the present
   study, we used database analysis, clinical pathological studies, and in
   vitro biological experiments on human hepatic cancer cell lines to
   assess the prognostic potential of the primary tumour cytokine mRNA
   levels and underlying mechanisms in HCC. First, we assessed the
   prognostic value of several cytokines from the TCGA database and found
   that IL-8 is a unique cytokine that is associated with poor overall
   survival of HCC patients. Then, we collected 87 HCC tumour and adjacent
   non-tumour specimens from patients and confirmed that patients with low
   IL-8 expression exhibited less intrahepatic invasion or distant
   metastasis, a lower recurrence rate and longer overall survival time
   compared to patients with high IL-8 expression. Wound healing,
   transwell, and western blotting assay results showed that IL-8 promotes
   the migration and invasion of Huh-7 and HepG2 cells, and the underlying
   mechanism is that IL-8 induces the EMT of HCC cells via the
   IL-8/ERK1/2/SNAI1 and IL-8/STAT3/TWIST1 signalling pathways. These
   results provide valuable biological IL-8 information which needs to be
   further investigated in liver cancer target therapy research.
   Furthermore, the intratumoural cytokine expression at the mRNA level may
   provide insight into hepatocarcinoma prognosis.

AB Notwithstanding the numerous drugs available for liver cancer, emerging
   evidence suggests that chemotherapeutic resistance is a significant
   issue. HGF and its receptor MET play critical roles in liver
   carcinogenesis and metastasis, mainly dependent on the activity of
   receptor tyrosine kinase. However, for unknown reasons, all HGF-MET
   kinase activity-targeted drugs have failed or have been suspended in
   clinical trials thus far. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a protective
   'self-eating' process for resisting metabolic stress by recycling
   obsolete components, whereas the impact of autophagy-mediated
   reprogrammed metabolism on therapeutic resistance is largely unclear,
   especially in liver cancer. In the present study, we first observed that
   HGF stimulus facilitated the Warburg effect and glutaminolysis to
   promote biogenesis in multiple liver cancer cells. We then identified
   the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and GLS/GLS1 as crucial
   substrates of HGF-activated MET kinase; MET-mediated phosphorylation
   inhibits PDHC activity but activates GLS to promote cancer cell
   metabolism and biogenesis. We further found that the key residues of
   kinase activity in MET (Y1234/1235) also constitute a conserved
   LC3-interacting region motif (Y1234-Y1235-x-V1237). Therefore, on
   inhibiting HGF-mediated MET kinase activation,
   Y1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET induced autophagy to maintain biogenesis
   for cancer cell survival. Moreover, we verified that
   Y1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET correlated with autophagy in clinical
   liver cancer. Finally, a combination of MET inhibitor and autophagy
   suppressor significantly improved the therapeutic efficiency of liver
   cancer in vitro and in mice. Together, our findings reveal an HGF-MET
   axis-coordinated functional interaction between tyrosine kinase
   signaling and autophagy, and establish a MET-autophagy double-targeted
   strategy to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in liver cancer.

AB Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common cancer worldwide. Sine oculis
   homeobox homolog (SIX3) is a human transcription factor that regulates
   the progression of vertebrate eye and fetal forebrain. However, studies
   on the function of SIX3 in human tumorigenesis remain rare. In this
   study, we aim to evaluate the role and the significance of SIX3 in EC.
   The TCGA database and clinical samples were used to assess the
   expression of SIX3 in EC patients. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's
   proportional hazards model were performed to analyze the correlations
   between SIX3 expression and EC clinical outcomes. The expressions of
   SIX3 in EC cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR
   analysis. The cell proliferation was detected using cell counting kit-8
   and colony formation assay. The migration and invasion capacity of EC
   cells were evaluated using wound healing and Transwell methods. Western
   blot assay was used to measure the alterations in some important protein
   expression levels in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We found that SIX3
   was highly expressed in the EC tissues and cells. In addition, high
   expression of SIX3 was related to poor survival. The knockdown of SIX3
   significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of
   ECA109 cells. A similar pattern was also found in the proliferation and
   migration of SKGT-4 cell line. The expression levels of some key
   proteins in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway were obviously decreased
   after cells were transfected with si-SIX3, possibly resulting in
   PI3K/AKT signaling inactivation. In addition, E-cadherin and N-cadherin
   showed some change. Collectively, the results shed light on a
   potentially promoting role of SIX3 in human EC. Thus, SIX3 might be
   considered a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for EC
   patients.

AB The protein containing the C2 domain has been well documented for its
   essential roles in endocytosis, cellular metabolism and cancer. Tac2-N
   (TC2N) is a tandem C2 domain-containing protein, but its function,
   including its role in tumorigenesis, remains unknown. Here, we first
   identified TC2N as a novel oncogene in lung cancer. TC2N was
   preferentially upregulated in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent
   normal lung tissues. High TC2N expression was significantly associated
   with poor outcome of lung cancer patients. Knockdown of TC2N markedly
   induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest with repressing
   proliferation in vitro, and suppresses tumorigenicity in vivo, whereas
   overexpression of TC2N has the opposite effects both in vitro and in
   vivo. Using a combination of TCGA database and bioinformatics, we
   demonstrate that TC2N is involved in regulation of the p53 signaling
   pathway. Mechanistically, TC2N attenuates p53 signaling pathway through
   inhibiting Cdk5-induced phosphorylation of p53 via inducing Cdk5
   degradation or disrupting the interaction between Cdk5 and p53.
   Moreover, the blockade of p53 attenuates the function of TC2N knockdown
   in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition,
   downregulated TC2N is involved in the apoptosis of lung cancer cells
   induced by doxorubicin, leading to p53 pathway activation. Overall,
   these findings uncover a role for the p53 inactivator TC2N in regulating
   the proliferation and apoptosis of lung cancer cells. Our present study
   provides novel insights into the mechanism of tumorigenesis in lung
   cancer.

AB Background Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play a
   key role in gastric cancer (GC) tumorigenesis. However, the clinical
   application value of serum lncRNAs in GC has remained largely unknown.
   We investigated the role of a novel lncRNA named CTC-497E21.4 in the
   diagnosis and the prognosis of GC. Methods We focused on evaluation of
   lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (RTFQ-PCR). The study involved following aspects: (1)
   confirmation of the higher lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 expression in different
   types of GC specimens than corresponding controls; (2) evaluation of
   monitoring tumor dynamics by the serum lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 assay; (3)
   evaluation of the prognostic value of lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 assay in GC.
   Results (1) The method of RTFQ-PCR detection of lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 was
   evaluated to have high sensitivity and specificity. (2) The expression
   levels of lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 were higher in GC patients compared with
   corresponding controls (p<0.001), and the combination of serum lncRNA
   CTC-497E21.4, CEA and CA19-9 could improve diagnostic sensitivity
   (96.36%). (3) The serum lncRNA CTC-497E21.4 expression levels were lower
   in postoperative samples than preoperative samples (p=0.0021) and
   survival curves downloaded from TCGA showed high lncRNA CTC-497E21.4
   levels were associated with poor OS of GC (p=0.0351). Conclusions lncRNA
   CTC-497E21.4 may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and the
   prognosis of GC.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported as essential
   regulators in human cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In
   the present study, we found that lncRNA long intergenic non-protein
   coding RNA 467 (LINC00467) was expressed higher in TCGA LUAD samples and
   predicted poor prognosis in LUAD patients. High expression of LINC00467
   was further detected in LUAD cell lines. Functionally, high expression
   level of LINC00467 promoted LUAD cell proliferation and migration,
   indicating that LINC00467 exerted oncogenic functions in LUAD
   progression. Considering the upregulation of LINC00467 in LUAD, we
   further detected the activator of LINC00467 promoter. Combining with
   bioinformatics analysis and mechanism experiments, we determined that
   LINC00467 was activated by STAT1 in LUAD. Moreover, high expression of
   LINC00467 was found to be associated with the activation of
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Rescue assays demonstrated that
   dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK1; an inhibitor of
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway) and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
   involved in DKK1-mediated LUAD cell proliferation and migration.
   Furthermore, LINC00467 was located in the nucleus of LUAD cell lines and
   negatively regulated DKK1 in LUAD cells. Mechanistically, we determined
   that LINC00467 epigenetically silenced DKK1 by recruiting enhancer of
   zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) to DKK1 promoter.
   Collectively, we determined that STAT1-induced upregulation of LINC00467

AB Background and Objectives Bladder cancer is one of the most common and
   highly recurrent cancers worldwide. Recurrence-associated genes may
   potentially predict cancer recurrence. We aimed to construct a
   recurrence-associated gene panel to improve the prognostic prediction of
   bladder cancer. Methods Based on DNA sequencing and clinical data from
   the TCGA-BLCA project, we identified 10 potential driver genes
   significantly associated with recurrence of bladder cancer. We performed
   multivariable logistic regression analysis to construct an optimized
   recurrence prediction model with nine recurrence-associated genes (EME1,
   AKAP9, ZNF91, PARD3, STAG2, ZFP36L2, METTL3, POLR3B, and MUC7) and
   clinical information as the independent variables. Results The area
   under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.80 in this
   model, much higher than that of the baseline model (AUC = 0.73) and the
   same trend was also validated in its subset. Decision curve analysis
   also revealed that there is a significant net benefit gained by adding
   nine genes mutation to the baseline model. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier
   survival analysis showed that eight out of the nine genes (excluding
   MUC7) had good effects on the overall prognosis of patients. Conclusions
   This nine-gene panel will most likely be a useful tool for prognostic
   evaluation and will facilitate the personalized management of patients
   with bladder cancer.

AB Accumulating evidence has appreciated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as
   novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in malignant
   carcinomas. Here, we aim to investigate the value of a novel cancer
   related IncRNA, LOXL1-AS1, in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). LOXL1-AS1 was
   found overexpressed in CCA tissues screened by high-throughput
   sequencing technology. Upregulation of LOXL1-AS1 was identified by TCGA
   database and qRT-PCR analysis. Additionally, upregulation of LOXL1-AS1
   was associated with lymph node invasion, advanced TNM stages and
   unfavorable prognosis. Loss-of-function and gain-of function experiments
   were conducted and validated that LOXL1-AS1 could facilitate cell
   proliferation, migration and invasion and attenuate cell apoptosis.
   Moreover, luciferase reporter and rescue assays indicated that LOXL1-AS1
   functioned as a ceRNA to elevate ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
   (ABCA1) level by sponging miR-324-3p and exhibited the malignant
   phenotypes of CCA cells, thereby playing an oncogenic role in CCA. Taken
   together, this study reveals that LOXL1-AS1 might act as a potential
   biomarker and therapeutic target for CCA clinical application. (C) 2019

AB Somatic mutation signatures may represent footprints of genetic and
   environmental exposures that cause different cancer. Few studies have
   comprehensively examined their association with germline variants, and
   none in an indigenous African population. SomaticSignatures was employed
   to extract mutation signatures based on whole-genome or whole-exome
   sequencing data from female patients with breast cancer (TCGA, training
   set, n=1011; Nigerian samples, validation set, n=170), and to estimate
   contributions of signatures in each sample. Association between somatic
   signatures and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or rare
   deleterious variants were examined using linear regression. Nine stable
   signatures were inferred, and four signatures (APOBEC C>T, APOBEC C>G,
   aging, and homologous recombination deficiency) were highly similar to
   known COSMIC signatures and explained the majority (60%~85%) of
   signature contributions. There were significant heritable components
   associated with APOBEC C>T signature (h2 = 0.575, p = 0.010) and the
   combined APOBEC signatures (h2 = 0.432, p = 0.042). In TCGA dataset,
   seven common SNPs within or near GNB5 were significantly associated with
   an increased proportion (beta = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.21~0.45) of APOBEC
   signature contribution at genome-wide significance, while rare germline
   mutations in MTCL1 was also significantly associated with a higher
   contribution of this signature (p = 6.1*10-6 ). This is the first study
   to identify associations between germline variants and mutational
   patterns in breast cancer across diverse populations and geography. The
   findings provide evidence to substantiate causal links between germline
   genetic risk variants and carcinogenesis. This article is protected by

AB BACKGROUND: The identification of appropriate biomarkers is essential to
   support important clinical decisions in patients with prostate cancer.
   The aim of our study wasa systematic bioinformatical analysis of the
   mRNA expression of all genes available for the prostate adenocarcinoma
   cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), regarding their potential
   prognostic and diagnostic role.
   METHODS: The study cohort comprises 499 patients (TCGA prostate cancer
   cohort). mRNA expression data were available for approx. 20,000 genes.
   The bioinformatical statistical pipeline addressed gene expression
   differences in tumor vs. benign prostate tissue (including gene set
   enrichment analysis, GSEA) in samples from tumors with different
   aggressivenesses (Gleason score), as well as prognostic values in
   multistep survival analyses.
   RESULTS: Among all genes analyzed, 1754 were significantly downregulated
   and 1553 genes were significantly upregulated in tumor tissue. In GSEA,
   16 of 30 top enriched biological processes were alterations of
   epigenetic regulation at different levels. Significant correlation with
   Gleason Score was evident for 8724 genes (range of Pearson r-values
   0.09-0.43; all p<0.05). In univariate Cox regression analyses, mRNA
   expression of 3571 genes showed statistically significant association
   with biochemical recurrence-free survival with a range of hazard ratios
   0.3-3.8 (p-value 7.4e-07 to 0.05). Among these, 571 genes were
   independently associated with biochemical recurrence in multivariate
   analysis. Access to the full database including results is provided as
   supplement.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our systematic analysis we found a big number of genes
   of potential diagnostic and prognostic value, many of which have not
   been studied in prostate cancer to date. Due to the comprehensive nature
   of this analysis and free access to the results, this study represents a
   reference database for prostate cancer researchers which can be used as
   a powerful tool for validation purposes and planning of new studies.

AB Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a life-threatening form of skin cancer.
   Prognostic biomarkers can reliably stratify patients at initial melanoma
   diagnosis according to risk, and may inform clinical decisions. Here, we
   performed a retrospective, cohort-based study analyzing genome-wide DNA
   methylation of 461 patients with CM from the TCGA database. Cox
   regression analyses were conducted to establish a four-DNA methylation
   signature that was significantly associated with the overall survival
   (OS) of patients with CM, and that was validated in an independent
   cohort. Corresponding Kaplan-Meier analysis displayed a distinct
   separation in OS. The ROC analysis confirmed that the predictive
   signature performed well. Notably, this signature exhibited much higher
   predictive accuracy in comparison with known biomarkers. This signature
   was significantly correlated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
   immunotherapy-related signatures, and may have potential as a guide for
   measures of responsiveness to ICB immunotherapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) occurs frequently in patients
   with gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and confers a poor prognosis.
   Multiplex profiling of primary GACs has been insightful but the
   underpinnings of PC's development/progression remain largely unknown. We
   characterised exome/transcriptome/immune landscapes of PC cells from
   patients with GAC aiming to identify novel therapeutic targets.
   DESIGN: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole
   transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on 44 PC specimens (43 patients with
   PC) including an integrative analysis of WES, RNA-seq, immune profile,
   clinical and pathological phenotypes to dissect the molecular
   pathogenesis, identifying actionable targets and/or biomarkers and
   comparison with TCGA primary GACs.
   RESULTS: We identified distinct alterations in PC versus primary GACs,
   such as more frequent CDH1 and TAF1 mutations, 6q loss and chr19 gain.
   Alterations associated with aggressive PC phenotypes emerged with
   increased mutations in TP53, CDH1, TAF1 and KMT2C, higher level of
   'clock-like' mutational signature, increase in whole-genome doublings,
   chromosomal instability (particularly, copy number losses), reprogrammed
   microenvironment, enriched cell cycle pathways, MYC activation and
   impaired immune response. Integrated analysis identified two main
   molecular subtypes: 'mesenchymal-like' and 'epithelial-like' with
   discriminating response to chemotherapy (31% vs 71%). Patients with the
   less responsive 'mesenchymal-like' subtype had high expression of immune
   checkpoint T-Cell Immunoglobulin And Mucin Domain-Containing Protein 3
   (TIM-3), its ligand galectin-9, V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell
   activation (VISTA) and transforming growth factor-beta as potential
   therapeutic immune targets.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have uncovered the unique mutational landscape, copy
   number alteration and gene expression profile of PC cells and defined PC
   molecular subtypes, which correlated with PC therapy
   resistance/response. Novel targets and immune checkpoint proteins have
   been identified with a potential to be translated into clinics.

AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recognized as novel biomarkers
   and therapeutic targets in human cancer including head-neck squamous
   cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here, we aimed to investigate the expression of
   a novel lncRNA WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 antisense
   RNA 1 (WWTR1-AS1) as well as its clinical significance and biological
   roles in HNSCC. The expression level of endogenous WWTR1-AS1 in primary
   HNSCC and paired adjacent nontumor mucosa was evaluated by quantitative
   reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The correlations were
   assessed between WWTR1-AS1 expression and clinical data such as
   clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. Further, the
   molecular mechanisms of WWTR1-AS1 underlying HNSCC progression were
   detected by loss-of-function assay in vitro and bioinformatics analysis.
   Aberrant overexpression of WWTR1-AS1 in HNSCC samples showed a
   significant correlation between its higher expression levels and larger
   tumor size, cervical node metastasis, and poor prognosis. WWTR1-AS1
   knockdown mediated by antisense oligonucleotide markedly inhibited cell
   proliferation, migration, invasion, tumorsphere formation as well as
   apoptosis resistance probably by modulating WWTR1 messenger RNA (mRNA)
   stability in HNSCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that
   WWTR1-AS1 expression positively correlated with WWTR1 expression in
   TCGA-HNSCC data sets. Together, our data provide evidence that aberrant
   upregulation of WWTR1-AS1 associates with malignant features and
   unfavorable prognosis in HNSCC, highlighting that WWTR1-AS1 might be a
   potential oncogenic lncRNA during HNSCC progression.

AB Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a common cancer worldwide, and
   this study aimedto investigate the key regulatory networks and
   prognostic indicators of LSCC. MicroRNA (miRNA)/messenger RNA (mRNA)
   sequencing and DNA methylation data were obtained from the Cancer Genome
   Atlas. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and genes (DEGs) were
   identified by the limma package. Then, the transcription factors (TFs)
   of DEmiRNAs/DEGs, as well as the targets of miRNAs, were predicted by
   the TFmiR online tool. Using the t test, aberrant methylation was
   detected in TF binding sites (TFBSs) in promoters. Finally, integrated
   network and survival analyses were conducted using SPSS software. We
   obtained 104 DEmiRNAs and 4,491 DEGs, and validated 2,113 DEGs (VDEGs).
   Then, 103 TFs, 295 TFs, and 14 DEmiRNAs were predicted to target 95
   DEmiRNAs, 821 DEGs and 283 DEGs, respectively. After TF-DEmiRNA/DEG and
   TF-DEmiRNA-DEG networks were constructed (e.g., E2F1-CDC25A, miR29a-RAN,
   miR326-TBL1XR1), five feedforward loops between ZEB1 and
   miR-141/200a/200b/200c/429 were found. Furthermore, VDEGs CDC25A, RAN,
   TBL1XR1as well as miR-130b and miR-590 were negatively correlated with
   survival rates. E2F1-CDC25A, miR29a-RAN, miR326-TBL1XR1, and the
   feedforward loops between ZEB1/ZEB2 and miR-141/200a/200b/200c/429 might
   participate in LSCC development. Compared with BEAS-2B cells, the
   SK-MES-1 cells presented a higher expression level of miR-141, miR-200a,
   miR-200b, miR-200c but a lower expression level of ZEB1. Overexpressed
   miR-200c significantly attenuated the expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2and
   inhibited the proliferation and migration of SK-MES-1 cells (all
   p<0.05). In addition, CDC25A, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-130b,
   and miR-590 are potential prognostic indicators of LSCC.

AB The pseudogene DUXAP10 is overexpressed in numerous types of human
   cancers. However, the diagnostic and prognostic value of DUXAP10 in
   cancers has yet to be characterized. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus databases were
   comprehensively searched in this study. A total of 50 studies comprising
   11,292 patients were collected in this integrated analysis. DUXAP10 was
   confirmed to be significantly overexpressed in various human cancers
   (p<.05). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve analysis
   was implemented, which indicated that DUXAP10 was a potential diagnostic
   biomarker for human cancers (area under the curve [AUC] of SROC
   curve=0.81 [0.77-0.84]; pooled sensitivity=0.69 [0.62-0.75]; pooled
   specificity=0.81 [0.73-0.87]). In addition, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained to evaluate the association of
   DUXAP10 expression with overall survival (OS) time of cancer patients.
   Outcomes of meta-analysis suggested that upregulation of DUXAP10 was
   closely associated with poor OS (pooled HR=1.11 [1.03-1.18]). Our study
   revealed that the pseudogene DUXAP10 was upregulated in multiple types
   of cancers and could be a potential biomarker with good diagnostic and
   prognostic value for human cancers.

AB BACKGROUND: Elevated protein expressions of CD markers such as
   IL2RA/CD25, CXCR4/CD184, CD34 and CD56 are associated with adverse
   prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the prognostic value
   of mRNA expressions of these CD markers in AML remains unclear. Through
   our pilot evaluation, IL2RA mRNA expression appeared to be the best
   candidate as a prognostic biomarker. Therefore, the aim of this study is
   to characterize the prognostic value of IL2RA mRNA expression and
   evaluate its potential to refine prognostification in AML.
   METHODS: In a cohort of 239 newly diagnosed AML patients, IL2RA mRNA
   expression were measured by TaqMan realtime quantitative PCR.
   Morphological, cytogenetics and mutational analyses were also performed.
   In an intermediate-risk AML cohort with 66 patients, the mRNA expression
   of prognostic biomarkers (BAALC, CDKN1B, ERG, MECOM/EVI1, FLT3, ID1,
   IL2RA, MN1 and WT1) were quantified by NanoString technology. A TCGA
   cohort was analyzed to validate the prognostic value of IL2RA. For
   statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher exact test, logistic
   regression, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used.
   RESULTS: In AML cohort of 239 patients, high IL2RA mRNA expression
   independently predicted shorter relapse free survival (RFS, p<0.001) and
   overall survival (OS, p<0.001) irrespective of age, cytogenetics,
   FLT3-ITD or c-KIT D816V mutational status. In core binding factor (CBF)
   AML, high IL2RA mRNA expression correlated with FLT3-ITD status
   (p=0.023). Multivariable analyses revealed that high IL2RA expression
   (p=0.002), along with c-KIT D816V status (p=0.013) significantly
   predicted shorter RFS, whereas only high IL2RA mRNA expression (p=0.014)
   significantly predicted shorter OS in CBF AML. In intermediate-risk AML
   in which multiple gene expression markers were tested by NanoString,
   IL2RA significantly correlated with ID1 (p=0.006), FLT3 (p=0.007),
   CDKN1B (p=0.033) and ERG (p=0.030) expressions. IL2RA (p<0.001) and FLT3
   (p=0.008) expressions remained significant in predicting shorter RFS,
   whereas ERG (p=0.008) and IL2RA (p=0.044) remained significant in
   predicting shorter OS. Similar analyses in TCGA intermediate-risk AML
   showed the independent prognostic role of IL2RA in predicting event free
   survival (p<0.001) and OS (p<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: High IL2RA mRNA expression is an independent and adverse
   prognostic factor in AML and specifically stratifies patients to worse
   prognosis in both CBF and intermediate-risk AML.

AB BACKGROUND Calcium-activated chloride channel A4 (CLCA4) is known as a
   tumor suppressor which contributes to the progression of a number of
   types of malignant tumors. However, little is known about the functional
   roles of CLCA4 in colorectal cancer (CRC). MATERIAL AND METHODS In this
   study, the expression patterns and dysregulation of mRNAs in CRC tissues
   were profiled by analyzing GSE21510 datasets from Gene Expression
   Omnibus database which contains 104 primary hepatocellular carcinoma
   tissues and 24 normal liver tissues, and by performing Kaplan-Meier
   analysis of TCGA data. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and
   quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were
   performed using clinical tissues collected at our institute. In order to
   explore the functional role of CLCA4, gain-of-function cell models were
   constructed in SW620 and LoVo cells. Wound healing assay and Transwell
   assay were carried out to access the cell migration and invasion
   ability. RESULTS It was found that CLCA4 was an independent predictor
   for overall survival and lymph node metastasis. Additionally,
   immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR results of the clinical tissues
   collected as part of our study further confirmed this correlation. In
   vitro experiments demonstrated that over-expression of CLCA4 could
   inhibit cell migration and invasion by suppressing
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via PI3K/ATK signaling and
   change the expression patterns of EMT markers in CLCA4-gain-of-function
   cell models. CONCLUSIONS CLCA4 inhibits migration and invasion by
   suppressing EMT via PI3K/ATK signaling and predicts favorable prognosis
   of CRC which may help to distinguish potential risk of lymph node
   metastasis in CRC.

AB Cell division cycle associated 7 like (CDCA7L) belongs to the JPO
   protein family, recently identified as a target gene of c‑Myc and is
   frequently dysregulated in multiple cancers. However, to the best of our
   knowledge, no studies to date have been carried out to investigate the
   functions of CDCA7L in glioma. Thus, in this study, the expression level
   of CDCA7L and its association with the prognosis in glioma were detected
   through the TCGA database. The mRNA expression levels of CDCA7L in
   glioblastoma (GBM) tissues and normal brain tissues were detected by
   RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. To explore the role of CDCA7L in
   glioma, CDCA7L siRNA was constructed and transfected into U87 glioma
   cells. The expression levels of CDCA7L and cyclinD1(CCND1) in glioma U87
   cells following transfection with CDCA7L siRNA were measured by RT‑qPCR
   and western blot analysis. CCK‑8, colony formation, EdU and Transwell
   assays were used to measure the effects of CDCA7L on U87 cell
   proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to monitor the changes in the
   cell cycle following transfection with CDCA7L siRNA. Xenograft tumors
   were examined invivo for the carcinogenic effects, as well as the
   mechanisms and prognostic value of CDCA7L in glioma tissues. The results
   revealed that CDCA7L was highly expressed in human GBM tissues, and a
   high expression of CDCA7L was associated with a poor prognosis of glioma
   patients through the TCGA database. We demonstrated that CDCA7L was
   highly expressed in human GBM tissues and 3 glioma cell lines. The
   downregulation CDCA7L expression significantly inhibited the
   proliferation and colony formation ability of U87 cells by blocking cell
   cycle progression in the G0/G1phase. In addition, we found that the mRNA
   and protein levels of CCND1 were markedly decreased following
   transfection with CDCA7L siRNA compared with NC siRNA invitro. The
   downregulation CDCA7L expression reduced the number of invading cells.
   Consistent with the results of the invitro assays, the xenograft assay,
   immunohistochemistry(IHC) assay and western blot analysis demonstrated
   that, in response to CDCA7L inhibition, tumor growth was inhibited,
   Ki‑67 and CCND1 expression levels were decreased invivo. On the whole,
   the results of the current study indicate that CDCA7L is highly
   expressed in human glioma tissues and that a high CDCA7L expression
   predicts a poor prognosis of glioma patients. CDCA7L promotes glioma U87
   cell growth through CCND1.

PY 2019
AB Lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma (LEL-HCC) is a distinct
   variant of HCC that is characterized by dense tumor-infiltrating
   lymphocytes (TILs). Patients with LEL-HCC also show better clinical
   outcomes compared to conventional HCC (c-HCC), which is commonly
   presented with low TIL. Emerging evidence has begun to highlight
   tumor-intrinsic genetic abnormalities in the tumor-host immune
   interfaces. However, genome-wide characterization of LEL-HCC remains
   largely unexplored. Here, we defined the genomic landscape of 12 LEL-HCC
   using whole-exome sequencing, and further underpinned those genetic
   alterations related to an immune active microenvironment by comparing
   findings to 15 c-HCC that were sequenced in parallel. Overall, the
   mutational load between LEL-HCC and c-HCC was similar. Interestingly,
   SNV incidences of specific genes (CTNNB1, AXIN1, NOTCH1, NOTCH2) were
   significantly higher in c-HCC than LEL-HCC, suggesting a plausible link
   between activated Wnt/beta-catenin and Notch signaling pathways and
   immune avoidance. Marked focal amplification of chromosome 11q13.3 was
   prevalent in LEL-HCC. Using TCGA dataset, we further established
   oncogenes expressed from chromosome 11q13.3 (CCND1, FGF19 and FGF4) to
   be strongly associated with the immune checkpoint signature (CD274,
   PDCD1, BTLA, CTLA4, HAVCR2, IDO1, LAG3). Our results have illustrated
   for the first time the somatic landscape of LEL-HCC, and highlighted
   molecular alterations that could be exploited in combinatory therapy
   with checkpoint inhibitors in targeting HCC. This article is protected

AB Objective: In this study, we aim to evaluate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)
   expression in human glioma tumors and the correlation between its
   expression with degrees of malignancy and autophagy, development of
   tumors.
   Method: Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were carried out to
   determine the expression of LC3, Beclin1 and TLR2 in 74 glioma
   specimens. We analyzed the prognosis of 551 glioma patients through the
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To determine the effect of TLR2 in glioma,
   we manipulated TLR2 expression using TLR2 plasmid transfer technique in
   U87 human glioma cell.
   Results: TLR2 expression in high-grade was significantly higher than
   that in low-grade glioma group (P < 0.05). TLR2 was positively
   correlated with tumor grade (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation showed that
   the expression of TLR2 was positively correlated with the numbers of LC3
   and Beclinl (P < 0.05). The patients with high TLR2 expression had a
   poorer outcome compared with the patients with low TLR2 in low-grade
   glioma (P < 0.05). TLR2 overexpression enhances glioma cell activity and
   accelerates cell cycle progression. In addition, treatment with TLR2
   overexpression increases the conversion rate of LC3-I to LC3-II and
   enhances the level of phosphorylated p38.
   Conclusion: TLR2 promotes development and progression of human glioma
   via enhancing autophagy.

AB BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths, and
   an increased number of GC patients adopt to next-generation sequencing
   (NGS) to identify tumor genomic alterations for precision medicine.
   METHODS: In this study, we established a hybridization capture-based NGS
   panel including 612 cancer-associated genes, and collected sequencing
   data of tumors and matched bloods from 153 gastric cancer patients. We
   performed comprehensive analysis of these sequencing and clinical data.
   RESULTS: 35 significantly mutated genes were identified such as TP53,
   AKAP9, DRD2, PTEN, CDH1, LRP2 et al. Among them, 29 genes were novel
   significantly mutated genes compared with TCGA study. TP53 is the top
   frequently mutated gene, and tends to mutate in male (p=0.025) patients
   and patients whose tumor located in cardia (p=0.011). High tumor
   mutation burden (TMB) gathered in TP53 wild-type tumors (p=0.045). TMB
   was also significantly associated with DNA damage repair (DDR) genes
   genotype (p=0.047), Lauren classification (p=1.5e-5), differentiation
   (1.9e-7), and HER2 status (p=0.023). 38.31% of gastric cancer patients
   harbored at least one actionable alteration according to OncoKB
   database.
   CONCLUSIONS: We drew a comprehensive mutational landscape of 153 gastric
   tumors and demonstrated utility of target next-generation sequencing to
   guide clinical management.

AB Cancer development requires a favorable tissue microenvironment. By
   deleting MyD88 in keratinocytes or specific bone marrow subpopulations
   in oncogenic RAS mediated skin carcinogenesis, we show that IL-17 from
   infiltrating T cells and IkBz signaling in keratinocytes are essential
   to produce a permissive microenvironment and tumor formation. Both
   normal and RAS transformed keratinocytes respond to tumor promoters by
   activating canonical NF-kB and IkBz signaling, releasing specific
   cytokines and chemokines that attract Th17 cells through MyD88 dependent
   signaling in T cells. The release of IL-17 into the microenvironment
   elevates IkBz in normal and RAS transformed keratinocytes. Activation of
   IkBz signaling is required for the expression of specific promoting
   factors induced by IL-17 in normal keratinocytes and constitutively
   expressed in RAS-initiated keratinocytes. Deletion of IkBz in
   keratinocytes impairs RAS mediated benign tumor formation.
   Transcriptional profiling and gene set enrichment analysis of
   IkBz-deficient RAS-initiated keratinocytes indicate that IkBz signaling
   is common for RAS transformation of multiple epithelial cancers. Probing
   TCGA data sets using this transcriptional profile indicates that
   reduction of IkBz signaling during cancer progression associates with
   poor prognosis in RAS-driven human cancers. Implications: The paradox
   that elevation of IkBz and stimulation of IkBz signaling through tumor
   extrinsic factors is required for RAS mediated benign tumor formation
   while relative IkBz expression is reduced in advanced cancers with poor
   prognosis implies that tumor cells switch from microenvironmental
   dependency early in carcinogenesis to cell autonomous pathways during
   cancer progression.

AB Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the subtype of head and neck
   cancers, is notorious for its high incidence and death rate. The role of
   long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is discovered to be significant for the
   canceration and cancer progression. Long intergenic non-protein coding
   RNA 958 (LINC00958) is discovered as a carcinogene in multiple cancers,
   such as gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioma, but there has
   been no report about how LINC00958 functions in OSCC. The objective of
   our study is to unfold function and mechanism investigation on LINC00958
   in OSCC. First, TCGA database showed the upregulation and prognostic
   significance of LINC00958 in head and neck squamous carcinoma. Then, we
   discovered in OSCC clinical samples that LINC00958 presented high
   expression and predicted poor prognosis. Also, LINC00958 was elevated in
   OSCC cells. In vitro gain- and loss-function experiments proved that
   LINC00958 facilitated cell growth, retarded apoptosis, accelerated
   migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in OSCC.
   Mechanistically, we confirmed the cytoplasmic expression of LINC00958 in

   upregulate YBX2 expression. Rescue assays indicated that LINC00958
   regulated OSCC cell proliferation, motility and EMT through YBX2.
   Together, we showed that LINC00958 promoted OSCC progression through
   miR-627-5p/YBX2 axis, indicating LINC00958 as a new prognostic marker,
   and provided new perspectives for molecular targeted treatment for OSCC.

AB The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data
   has received increasing attention for studying the complex mechanisms
   driving cancers. However, most image-genomic studies have been
   restricted to combining histopathological images with single modality of
   genomic data (e.g., mRNA transcription or genetic mutation), and thus
   neglect the fact that the molecular architecture of cancer is manifested
   at multiple levels including genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional and
   post-transcriptional events. To address this issue, we propose a novel
   ordinal multi-modal feature selection (OMMFS) framework that can
   simultaneously identify important features from both pathological images
   and multi-modal genomic data (i.e., mRNA transcription, copy number
   variation, and DNA methylation data) for the prognosis of cancer
   patients. Our model is based on a generalized sparse canonical
   correlation analysis framework, by which we also take advantage of the
   ordinal survival information among different patients for survival
   outcome prediction. We evaluate our method on three early-stage cancer
   datasets derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and the
   experimental results demonstrated that both the selected image and
   multi-modal genomic markers are strongly correlated with survival
   enabling effective stratification of patients with distinct survival
   than the comparing methods, which is often difficult for early-stage
   cancer patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and ligand-2 (PD-L2)
   interaction with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) represent an
   immune-inhibiting checkpoint mediating immune evasion and is,
   accordingly, an important target for blockade-based immunotherapy in
   cancer. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), improved understanding of
   PD-1 checkpoint blockade-responsive biology and identification of
   biomarkers for prediction of a clinical response to immunotherapy is
   warranted. Thus, in the present study, we systematically described PD-L1
   and PD-L2 expression correlated genes in NSCLC.
   METHODS: We performed comparative retrospective analyses to identify
   PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression correlated genes in NSCLC. For this, we
   examined available datasets from the cancer cell line encyclopedia
   (CCLE) project lung non-small-cell (Lung_NSC) and the cancer genome
   atlas (TCGA) projects lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell
   carcinoma (LUSC).
   RESULTS: Analysis of the CCLE dataset Lung_NSC identified expression
   correlation between PD-L1 and PD-L2. Moreover, we identified expression
   correlation between 489 genes and PD-L1, 191 genes and PD-L2, and 111
   genes for both. PD-L1 and PD-L2 also expression correlated in TCGA
   datasets LUAD and LUSC. In LUAD, we identified expression correlation
   between 257 genes and PD-L1, 914 genes and PD-L2, and 211 genes for
   both. In LUSC, we identified expression correlation between 26 genes and
   PD-L1, 326 genes and PD-L2, and 13 genes for both. Only a few genes
   expression correlated with PD-L1 and PD-L2 across the CCLE and TCGA
   datasets. Expression of Interferon signaling-involved genes converged in
   particular with the expression correlated genes for PD-L1 in Lung_NSC,
   for PD-L2 in LUSC, and for both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. In LUSC, PD-L1,
   and to a lesser extent PD-L2, expression correlated with chromosome 9p24
   localized genes, indicating a chromosome 9p24 topologically associated
   domain as an important driver of in particular LUSC PD-L1 expression.
   Expression correlation analyses of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 receptors
   programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), Cluster of differentiation 80
   (CD80), and Repulsive guidance molecule B (RGMB) showed that PD-1 and
   CD80 expression correlated with both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. CD80
   expression correlated with PD-L2 in LUSC.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present gene signatures associated with PD-L1 and PD-L2
   mRNA expression in NSCLC which could possess importance in relation to
   understand PD-1 checkpoint blockade-responsive biology and development
   of gene signature based biomarkers for predicting clinical responses to
   immunotherapy.

AB Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the highest mortality,
   invasion, and metastasis subtype of renal cell carcinoma. Bone
   morphogenetic protein (BMP) family has recently emerged as a group of
   cancer-related proteins in multiple pathogenesis of cancers. Currently,
   little is known about the prediction role of BMPs in ccRCC. Therefore,
   we screened The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma
   (TCGA-KIRC) database for ccRCC patients with complete clinical
   information and BMP family expression data. Multivariate analysis showed
   that high expression of BMP1 was associated with shorter overall
   survival (OS) (P=0.001), and shorter disease-free survival (DFS)
   (P=0.018). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed BMP1 was
   associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), G2M checkpoint,
   angiogenesis, hypoxia pathway, and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
   (KRAS) signaling. Knockdown BMP1 suppressed malignancy of ccRCC in vitro
   and in vivo. Our results indicated that high expressions of BMP1 were
   poor prognostic factors and gene therapy could be an effective treatment
   for ccRCC.

AB 1p/19q codeletion, which leads to the abnormal expression of 1p19q genes
   in oligodendroglioma, is associated with chemosensitivity and favorable
   prognosis. Here, we aimed to explore the clinical implications of 1p19q
   gene expression in 1p/19q non-codel gliomas. We analyzed expression of
   1p19q genes in 668 1p/19q non-codel gliomas obtained from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=447) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA)
   (n=221) for training and validation, respectively. The expression of
   1p19q genes was significantly correlated with the clinicopathological
   features and overall survival (OS) of 1p/19q non-codel gliomas. Then, we
   derived a risk signature of 25 selected 1p19q genes that not only had
   prognosis value in total 1p/19q non-codel gliomas but also had prognosis
   value in stratified gliomas. The prognosis value of the risk signature
   was superior than known clinicopathological features in 1p/19q non-codel
   gliomas and was also highly associated with the following features: loss
   of CDKN2A/B copy number in mutant-IDH-astrocytoma; TERT promoter
   mutation, combined chromosome 7 gain / chromosome 10 loss, and EGFR
   amplification in wildtype-IDH-astrocytoma; Classical and Mesenchymal
   subtypes in glioblastoma. Furthermore, genes enriched in the biological
   processes of cell division, extracellular matrix, angiogenesis
   significantly correlated to the signature risk-score, and this is also
   supported by the immunohistochemistry and cell biology experiments. In
   conclusion, the expression profile of 1p19q genes is highly associated
   with the malignancy and prognosis of 1p/19q non-codel gliomas. A
   25-1p19q-gene signature has powerfully predictive value for both
   malignant molecular pathological features and prognosis across distinct
   subgroups of 1p/19q non-codel gliomas.

AB Macroautophagy/autophagy is a natural intracellular process that
   maintains cellular homeostasis and protects cells from death under
   stress conditions. Autophagy sustains tumor survival and growth when
   induced by common cancer treatments, including IR and cytotoxic
   chemotherapy, thereby contributing to therapeutic resistance of tumors.
   In this study, we report that the expression of MIR93, noted in two
   clinically relevant tumor subtypes of GBM, influenced GSC phenotype as
   well as tumor response to therapy through its effects on autophagy. Our
   mechanistic studies revealed that MIR93 regulated autophagic activities
   in GSCs through simultaneous inhibition of multiple autophagy
   regulators, including BECN1/Beclin 1, ATG5, ATG4B, and SQSTM1/p62.
   Moreover, two first-line treatments for GBM, IR and temozolomide (TMZ),
   as well as rapamycin (Rap), the prototypic MTOR inhibitor, decreased
   MIR93 expression that, in turn, stimulated autophagic processes in GSCs.
   Inhibition of autophagy by ectopic MIR93 expression, or via autophagy
   inhibitors NSC (an ATG4B inhibitor) and CQ, enhanced the activity of IR
   and TMZ against GSCs. Collectively, our findings reveal a key role for
   MIR93 in the regulation of autophagy and suggest a combination treatment
   strategy involving the inhibition of autophagy while administering
   cytotoxic therapy.Abbreviations: ACTB: actin beta; ATG4B: autophagy

AB Circadian clock genes have become a hot topic in cancer research in
   recent years, and more and more studies are showing that clock genes are
   involved in regulating cell proliferation cycle and apoptosis of
   malignant tumors, neuroendocrine and immune function, and other
   processes. Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with increasing incidence
   worldwide. The pathogenesis of lung cancer is extremely complicated and
   includes genetic factors, living environment, and smoking, and the
   occurrence of lung cancer is related to the regulation of many oncogenes
   and tumor suppressor genes. But there are few studies on clock genes in
   lung cancer. Studies on clock genes may help to better understand the
   mechanism of lung cancer development for an improved treatment. The
   expressions of all 14 kinds of clock genes in adenocarcinoma (ADC) and
   squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), two main kinds of non-small-cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC), were studied based on integration and analysis of data
   from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to show the association between
   clock gene expression and prognosis of cancer patients. Analysis of TCGA
   data indicated that overexpression of Cry2, BMAL1, and RORA with
   underexpression of Timeless and NPAS2 was associated with a favorable
   prognosis of ADC, and the expression of NPAS2 was associated with the
   time of patient survival. Additionally, the expression of Cry2 was
   related to TNM stage. In SCC, high expression of DEC1 was correlated
   with poor overall survival in patients and the expression of Timeless
   was associated with the time of patient survival. In NSCLC, circadian
   clock genes constitute cancer circadian rhythm by interacting with each
   other, showing that asynchrony with normal tissues, which collectively
   controlling the occurrence and development of NSCLC.

AB Objective: Programmed death-ligand-1 (PDL1) is a moleculeinvolved in
   immune evasion in various kinds of tumors. Here, we aim to determine
   whether the expression of PDL1 protein is related to the response of
   patients to neoadjuvant therapy and survival outcome.Methods:
   Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on paraffin-embedded tumor
   samples from core needle biopsy before neoadjuvant therapy (NAT).
   Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the
   associations between PDL1 protein expression and pathological complete
   response (pCR) outcome. Kaplan-Meier plot and log-rank test were used to
   compare disease-free survival (DFS) between groups. A cox proportional
   hazards model was used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with
   95% confidential interval (95%CI).Results: A total of 94 patients were
   included for IHC testing. PDL1 protein expression on tumor cells was
   associated with better pCR rate in both univariate (OR = 2.621, p =
   0.043) and multivariate (OR = 3.595, p = 0.029) logistic regression
   analysis. It was also associated with shorter DFS both by log-rank test
   (p = 0.015) and cox hazard model (HR = 22.824, 95%CI 1.621-321.284, p =
   0.020). In hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients, PDL1 protein
   expression was also associated with better pCR (OR = 2.362, p = 0.022).
   It was also associated with poor DFS (HR = 18.821, 95%CI 1.645-215.330,
   p = 0.018).Conclusions: Our results show that PDL1 protein expression is
   a predictive biomarker of pCR and a prognostic factor of DFS in breast
   cancer patients and HR-positive subgroups.

AB Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies occurring in
   women worldwide. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
   has not been widely utilized in uncovering the biomarkers which played
   pivotal roles in BC treatment. This study aimed to verify the
   proliferative and anti-apoptotic effect of lncRNA
   TRPM2-AS/miR-140-3p/PYCR1 axis on BC based on WGCNA. WGCNA was applied
   for determining hub genes using gene expression data gained from breast
   cancer and adjacent tissues which were downloaded from the Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) database. The correlative curves showed the correlation
   between OS/DFS of BC patients and TRPM2-AS expression or PYCR1
   expression based on the data of survival rate of BC patients obtained
   from the TCGA database. QRT-PCR was employed in detecting the expression
   levels of TRPM2-AS, miR-140-3p and PYCR1, and western blot analysis was
   adopted for determination of protein expression level of PYCR1. Dual
   luciferase assay was applied to verify the targeting relationship
   between TRPM2-AS and miR-140-3p, as well as miR-140-3p and PYCR1. The
   roles of TRPM2-AS, miR-140-3p, and PYCR1 in proliferation, migration,
   and apoptosis of BC cell were identified by CCK-8 assay, cell migration
   assay and flow cytometry. Hub genes were also gained from WGCNA test.
   The prognostic study showed a significant negative correlation between
   the high expression of PYCR1 and TRPM2-AS and the BC survival. QRT-PCR
   demonstrated that PYCR1 and TRPM2-AS were both overexpressed, while
   miR-140-3p was greatly down-regulated in BC cell. In addition, it was
   validated by dual luciferase assay that miR-140-3p directly targeted
   both TRPM2-AS and PYCR1. Furthermore, down-regulation of TRPM2-AS and
   PYCR1 inhibited proliferation yet promoted apoptosis of BC cell, and
   up-regulation of miR-140-3p in BC cell showed the same tendency. Taken
   together, TRPM2-AS could promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of
   BC cell through TRPM2-AS/miR-140-3p/PYCR1 axis.

AB Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant diseases and has a poor
   prognosis. The screening and validation of biomarkers with predictive
   value for prognosis and treatment efficacy are important. To identify
   potential prognostic markers of pancreatic cancer patients, we conducted
   a study that included 99 pancreatic cancer patients. Three patients with
   PFS>18months were enrolled in the treat group, and three patients with
   PFS<12months were enrolled in the control group. Differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) between these two groups were analyzed by
   whole-genome expression microarray. A total of 178 DEGs were identified,
   including 110 up-regulated and 68 down-regulated genes. Next, 24
   candidate genes were selected for validation by qPCR based on fold
   change and previous studies. The results showed that the mRNA levels of
   four candidate genes, including ACSL5, SLC44A4, LOX, and TOX3, were
   correlated with PFS. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to
   validate the protein expression levels of these four markers. The
   results showed that patients with LOX (high), ACSL5 (low) and TOX3 (low)
   expression had a significantly shorter PFS than those with LOX (low),
   ACSL5 (high) and TOX3 (high) expression. Multivariable analysis revealed
   differentiation, tumor stage, LOX expression, and ACSL5 expression were
   independent prognostic factors for PFS. Then, we use the TCGA database
   to explore the underlying mechanism of LOX influence pancreatic cancer
   progression. Protein-protein interaction network of ACSL5 was
   established by STRING to uncover the potential regulation mechanism. Our
   findings reveal that LOX and ACSL5 are potential prognostic markers for
   the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancer in the
   world and the main cause of cancer death. Chronic hepatitis B virus
   (HBV) infection is the major cause of HCC. HBx, as a transactivator,
   plays an important role in the occurrence and development process of HCC
   leading by HBV infection. XTP8, related to HBx, however, there are no
   studies on the function of XTP8 in HCC. In our research, we demonstrated
   that XTP8 was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with
   non-cancerous tissues in Oncomine, TCGA and GEO database. Moreover,
   Kaplan-Meier Plotter analysis indicated that patients with higher XTP8
   expression had significantly lower overall survival. Our
   immunohistochemical results suggested that XTP8 protein expression in
   HCC tissues was dramatically higher compared with control normal
   tissues. Invivo xenograft experiments on nude mice, the overexpression
   of XTP8 promoted the tumorigenic ability of HepG2 cells. In HepG2 and
   Huh7 cells, XTP8 upregulated FOXM1 expression to promote cell
   proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis. FOXM1 knockdown reduced
   promoter activity of XTP8 to downregulate XTP8 expression. Thiostrepton,
   an inhibitor of FOXM1, decreased XTP8 expression. Therefore, our study
   demonstrates that XTP8 is a valuable prognostic predictor for HCC and
   there is a novel positive regulatory feedback loop between XTP8 and
   FOXM1 promoting the development of HCC.

AB PurposeIn early stage, ER-positive breast cancer, concurrent use of
   endocrine therapy and chemotherapy has not been shown to be superior to
   sequential use. We hypothesized that genetic biomarkers can aid in
   selecting patients who would benefit from chemo-endocrine therapy. Our
   previous studies revealed that ZNF423 is a transcription factor for
   BRCA1 and an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ZNF423,
   rs9940645, determines tamoxifen response. Here, we identified
   mitosis-related genes that are regulated by ZNF423 which led us to
   investigate taxane response in a rs9940645 SNP- and tamoxifen-dependent
   fashion.MethodsThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset was
   used to identify genes correlated with ZNF423. Quantitative reverse
   transcription PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase
   reporter assays were used to validate the gene regulation. We used
   CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer paired ZR-75-1 cells which differ only in ZNF423
   rs9940645 SNP genotype to test SNP-dependent phenotypes including cell
   cycle and cell viability. We validated our findings in an additional two
   breast cancer cell lines, Hs578T-ER and HCC1500.ResultsMitosis-related
   genes VRK1 and PBK, which encode histone H3 kinases, were experimentally
   validated to be regulated by ZNF423. ZNF423 knockdown decreased VRK1 and
   PBK expression and activity. Additionally, ZNF423 knockdown enhanced
   docetaxel-induced G2/M arrest and cytotoxicity through VRK1 or PBK
   regulation. Lastly, cells carrying the rs9940645 variant genotype had
   increased G2/M arrest and decreased cell viability when treated with
   docetaxel in combination with estradiol and 4-OH-TAM.ConclusionsWe
   identified ZNF423 regulated genes involved in the G2/M phase of the cell
   cycle. 4-OH-TAM sensitized ER-positive breast cancer cells to docetaxel
   in a ZNF423 SNP-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that patients
   with rs9940645 variant genotype may benefit from concurrent tamoxifen
   and docetaxel. This would impact a substantial proportion of patients
   because this SNP has a minor allele frequency of 0.47.

AB PurposeTo evaluate the prognostic effect of the integration of genomic
   and transcriptomic profiles in breast cancer.MethodsEight hundred and
   ten samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets were randomly
   divided into the training set (540 subjects) and validation set (270
   subjects). We first selected single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and
   genes associated with breast cancer prognosis in the training set to
   construct the prognostic prediction model, and then replicated the
   prediction efficiency in the validation set.ResultsFour SNPs and three
   genes associated with the prognosis of breast cancer in the training set
   were included in the prognostic model. Patients were divided into the
   high-risk group and low-risk group based on the four SNPs and three
   genes signature-based genetic prognostic index. High-risk patients
   showed a significant worse overall survival [Hazard Ratio (HR) 9.43, 95%
   confidence interval (CI) 3.81-23.33, P<0.001] than the low-risk group.
   Compared to the model constructed with only gene expression, the C
   statistics for the signature-based genetic prognostic index [area under
   curves (AUC)=0.79, 95% CI 0.72-0.86] showed a significant increase
   (P<0.001). Additionally, we further replicated the prognostic prediction
   model in the validation set as patients in the high-risk group also
   showed a significantly worse overall survival (HR 4.55, 95% CI
   1.50-13.88, P<0.001), and the C statistics for the signature-based
   genetic prognostic index was 0.76 (95% CI 0.65-0.86). The following
   time-dependent ROC revealed that the mean of AUCs were 0.839 and 0.748
   in the training set and the validation set, respectively.ConclusionsOur
   findings suggested that integrating genomic and transcriptomic profiles
   could greatly improve the predictive efficiency of the prognosis of
   breast cancer patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Tumor microenvironment and its interaction with
   neuroendocrine modulators contribute to prostate carcinogenesis and
   progression.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the transcriptomic and clinical
   implications of neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in prostate cancer
   progression.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Genome-wide expression profiling of
   three localized prostate cancer (total n=18818) and five metastatic
   castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC; total n=495) cohorts was used
   to characterize NPY expression. All men underwent radical prostatectomy
   (RP) for localized prostate cancer.
   OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patients were grouped
   into those with low NPY and high NPY based on NPY expression.
   Associations between these groups and histological, genomic, and
   clinical outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS) and
   metastases-free survival (MFS) were examined. Combining ERG-fusion
   status with NPY expression, four groups were defined (lowNPY/ERG+,
   lowNPY/ERG-, highNPY/ERG+, and highNPY/ERG-). Cox proportional hazards
   modeled the time to distant metastasis after RP. Genomic risk scores for
   metastasis were calculated for prospective samples, based on a 22-gene
   signature.
   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Across cancers, NPY showed the highest
   expression in prostate cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   PAN-Cancer cohort (n=9483, p<0.0001). In 17967 prospective samples, low
   NPY expression was associated with aggressive grade group 5 disease and
   a higher genomic risk (p<0.0001). In the retrospective (n=355) and TCGA
   (n=497) cohorts, low NPY was associated with shorter MFS and PFS,
   respectively (p=0.001 for both). In mCRPC cohorts, low NPY was
   associated with neuroendocrine development (p<0.01). NPY was highly
   correlated to ERG; thus, we defined four groups based on NPY expression
   and ERG fusion. The lowNPY/ERG+ subtype was associated with the highest
   genomic risk for metastasis (p<0.0001) and the highest rate of
   metastasis compared with all other subtypes (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.2
   [1.22-4.03], p=0.008), while the highNPY/ERG- subtype was associated
   with the lowest genomic risk for metastasis (p<0.0001) and the lowest
   rate of metastasis (HR: 0.53 [0.35-0.81], p=0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: Low NPY expression is associated with adverse genomic
   features and clinical correlates and outcomes. The lowNPY/ERG+ subtype
   was associated with the highest risk of developing metastasis.
   Prognostic subgrouping and tailored treatments by NPY expression and ERG
   fusion status warrant further study.
   PATIENT SUMMARY: The low neuropeptide Y prostate cancer subtype appears
   to be aggressive with a high risk of developing metastasis.

AB INTRODUCTION: Tumour-associated angiogenesis is associated with the
   malignancy and poor prognosis of glioma. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
   mutations are present in the majority of lower-grade (WHO grade II and
   III) and secondary glioblastomas, but their roles in tumour angiogenesis
   remain unclear.
   METHODS: Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the cerebral blood flow
   (CBF) of IDH-mutated glioma was measured and compared with the
   IDH-wildtype glioma. The densities of microvessels in IDH-mutated and
   wildtype astrocytoma and glioblastoma were assessed by
   immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with CD34, and the pericytes were
   labelled with alpha-smooth muscle antigen (alpha-SMA), neural-glial
   antigen 2 (NG2) and PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta), respectively.
   Furthermore, glia-specific mutant IDH1 knock-in mice were generated to
   evaluate the roles of mutant IDH1 on brain vascular architectures. The
   transcriptions of the angiogenesis-related genes were assessed in TCGA
   datasets, including ANGPT1, PDGFB and VEGFA. The expressions of these
   genes were further determined by western blot in U87-MG cells expressing
   a mutant IDH1 or treated with 2-HG.
   RESULTS: The MRI results indicated that CBF was reduced in the
   IDH-mutated gliomas. The IHC staining showed that the pericyte coverages
   of microvessels were significantly decreased, but the microvessel
   densities (MVDs) were only slightly decreased in IDH-mutated glioma. The
   mutant IDH1 knock-in also impeded the pericyte coverage of brain
   microvessels in mice. Moreover, the TCGA database showed the mRNA levels
   of angiogenesis factors, including ANGPT1, PDGFB and VEGFA, were
   downregulated, and their promoters were also highly hyper-methylated in
   IDH-mutated gliomas. In addition, both mutant IDH1 and D-2-HG could
   downregulate the expression of these genes in U87-MG cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that IDH mutations could reduce the
   pericyte coverage of microvessels in astrocytic tumours by inhibiting
   the expression of angiogenesis factors. As vascular pericytes play an
   essential role in maintaining functional blood vessels to support tumour
   growth, our findings imply a potential avenue of therapeutic strategy
   for IDH-mutated gliomas.

AB Detection of gene-modules is one of the fundamental tasks for the
   integral analysis of network architecture. In this paper, we propose a
   novel algorithm using an integrated approach comprising statistical
   method and normalized mutual information-based hypograph mining for
   discovering the multiview co-similarity gene modules contained in
   multiview datasets. For this purpose, we first identify the
   statistically significant genes corresponding to each data profile and
   subsequently obtain the union set consisting of all these statistically
   significant genes. For each data profile, we then propose a new
   similarity score called as integrated normalized mutual information to
   obtain the similarity scores across all possible pairs of genes
   belonging to the union set by employing the results of gene clustering
   obtained through applying normalized mutual information-based graph
   clustering on the corresponding data profile. Moreover, we propose a new
   information theoretic measure called as multiview normalized mutual
   information to integrate all the similarity scores of a given gene-pair
   obtained across all the data profiles. For the experiment, we utilize
   one of the recently used multiview dataset named TCGA acute myeloid
   leukemia dataset comprising five different categories of data profiles.
   Furthermore, the co-similarity strengths of all the multiview gene
   modules obtained using the proposed method (PM) are reported. Finally,
   we provide a comparative study between the proposed and other existing
   methods for demonstrating the superiority of the PM over others.

AB PurposeBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and although advances
   in molecular subtyping have been achieved in recent years, most
   subtyping strategies target individual genes independent of one another
   and primarily concentrate on proliferative markers. The contributions of
   biological processes and immune patterns have been neglected in breast
   cancer subtype stratification.MethodsWe performed a gene set variation
   analysis to simplify the information on biological processes using
   hallmark terms and to decompose immune cell data using the immune cell
   gene terms on 985 breast invasive ductal/lobular carcinoma RNAseq
   samples in the TCGA database.ResultsThe samples were gathered into three
   clusters following implementation of the t-SNE and DBSCAN algorithms and
   were categorized as hallmark-tsne' subtypes. Here, we identified a
   high-risk luminal A dominant breast cancer subtype (C3) that displayed
   increased motility, cancer stem cell-like features, a higher expression
   of hormone/luminal-related genes, a lower expression of
   proliferation-related genes and immune dysfunction. With regard to
   immune dysfunction, we observed that the motility-increased C3 subtype
   exhibited high granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) expression
   accompanied by neutrophil aggregation. Cancer cells that produce high
   levels of G-CSF can stimulate neutrophils to form neutrophil
   extracellular traps, which promote cancer cell migration. This finding
   sheds light on one potential explanation for why the C3 subtype
   correlates with poor prognosis.ConclusionsThe hallmark-tsne subtypes
   confirmed again that even the luminal A subtype is heterogeneous and can
   be further subdivided. The biological processes and immune heterogeneity
   of breast cancer must be understood to facilitate the improvement of
   clinical treatments.

AB ObjectThis study was conducted to identify the prognostic microRNA
   (miRNA) for the prediction of survival in colon adenocarcinoma (CA).
   MethodsmiRNA profiling of patients with CA was downloaded from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. After data processing, univariate
   Cox regression was performed to select potential prognostic miRNAs.
   Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator approach was conducted
   to identify the key prognostic miRNA biomarkers. Log-rank test was
   performed to compare survival outcome between patients with different
   regulation type of identified miRNAs. Then, bioinformatics analysis
   including Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology, and pathway enrichment
   analysis was performed on the selected prognostic miRNAs. A nomogram was
   generated based on the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model to
   illustrate the association between the identified miRNAs and the
   survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). All analyses were
   conducted with packages in the R software.
   ResultsA total of 1881 miRNAs were obtained from TCGA database in which
   15 miRNAs were finally selected in multianalysis with covariates and
   incorporated into functional annotation analyses. Log-rank test
   suggested that the identified miRNAs were associated with the survival
   of CA. Seven out of 15 selected miRNAs were identified for the first
   time in CA. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the identified miRNAs
   were associated with the development and progress of CRC. The
   association between the identified miRNAs and the survival of patients
   with CRC were presented in a nomogram.
   ConclusionThe seven newly identified miRNAs might be potential
   prognostic biomarkers for the survival of CA. Further research about the
   selected miRNAs were worth to conduct.

AB Deregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have been critically implicated
   in tumorigenesis and serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic
   biomarkers. Here we sought to develop a prognostic lncRNA signature in
   patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Original
   RNA-seq data of 499 HNSCC samples were retrieved from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas database, which was randomly divided into training and testing
   set. Univariate Cox regression survival analysis, robust
   likelihood-based survival model and random sampling iterations were
   applied to identify prognostic lncRNA candidates in the training cohort.
   A prognostic risk score was developed based on the Cox coefficient of
   four individual lncRNA imputed as follows: (0.14546xexpression level of
   RP11-366H4.1) + (0.27106xexpression level of
   LINC01123)+(0.54316xexpression level of
   RP11-110I1.14)+(-0.48794xexpression level of CTD-2506J14.1).
   Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with high-risk score had
   significantly reduced overall survival as compared with those with
   low-risk score when patients in training, testing, and validation
   cohorts were stratified into high- or low-risk subgroups. Multivariate
   survival analysis further revealed that this 4-lncRNA signature was a
   novel and important prognostic factor independent of multiple
   clinicopathological parameters. Importantly, ROC analyses indicated that
   predictive accuracy and sensitivity of this 4-lncRNA signature
   outperformed those previously well-established prognostic factors.
   Noticeably, prognostic score based on quantification of these 4-lncRNA
   via qRT-PCR in another independent HNSCC cohort robustly stratified
   patients into subgroups with high or low survival. Taken together, we
   developed a robust 4-lncRNA prognostic signature for HNSCC that might
   provide a novel powerful prognostic biomarker for precision oncology.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant liver
   disease in the world. However, the mechanistic relationships among
   various genes and signaling pathways are still largely unclear. In this
   study, we aimed to elucidate potential core candidate genes and pathways
   in HCC. The expression profiles GSE14520, GSE25097, GSE29721, and
   GSE62232, which cover 606 tumor and 550 nontumour samples, were
   downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Furthermore,
   HCC RNA-seq datasets were also downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered
   using R software, and we performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis using the online
   databases DAVID 6.8 and KOBAS 3.0. Furthermore, the protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) network complex of these DEGs was constructed by
   Cytoscape software, the molecular complex detection (MCODE) plug-in and
   the online database STRING. First, a total of 173 DEGs (41 upregulated
   and 132 downregulated) were identified that were aberrantly expressed in
   both the GEO and TCGA datasets. Second, GO analysis revealed that most
   of the DEGs were significantly enriched in extracellular exosomes,
   cytosol, extracellular region, and extracellular space. Signaling
   pathway analysis indicated that the DEGs had common pathways in
   metabolism-related pathways, cell cycle, and biological oxidations.
   Third, 146 nodes were identified from the DEG PPI network complex, and
   two important modules with a high degree were detected using the MCODE
   plug-in. In addition, 10 core genes were identified, TOP2A, NDC80,
   FOXM1, HMMR, KNTC1, PTTG1, FEN1, RFC4, SMC4, and PRC1. Finally,
   Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival and correlation analysis were
   applied to these genes. The abovementioned findings indicate that the
   identified core genes and pathways in this bioinformatics analysis could
   significantly enrich our understanding of the development and recurrence
   of HCC; furthermore, these candidate genes and pathways could be
   therapeutic targets for HCC treatment.

AB IntroductionProstate adenocarcinoma is one of the most prevalent causes
   of cancer-related deaths in males worldwide. However, the underlying
   mechanisms remain poorly understood. Hence, it is important to identify
   specific and effective therapeutic targets, to be able to determine
   appropriate therapy and management. So, this study aimed to predict that
   miR-93-5p is an important oncogene in prostate cancer by bioinformatics
   analysis.
   MethodsIn this study, initially we identified differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs) and differently expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in the The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, performed Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway
   enrichment analysis, then investigated the relationship between DEGs and
   DEMs, and finally through consulting the literature and retrieving the
   database, we found that miR-93-5p may play a major role in prostate
   cancer, so we predicted the expression and survival of miR-93-5p and its
   isomers by bioinformatics analysis, meanwhile, evaluated the function of
   miR-93-5p in vitro.
   ResultsIn total, 104 DEMs were differently expressed between prostate
   cancer and normal samples, including 56 downregulated ones and 48
   upregulated ones; miR-93-5p (upregulated) was identified as a good
   biomarker. And 1904 DEGs were retrieved, including 794 downregulated
   ones and 1110 upregulated ones. We also obtained 1254 DEGs of the DEMs.
   In GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, the
   significantly enriched pathways involved pathway in focal adhesion,
   vascular smooth muscle contraction, and regulation of actin
   cytoskeleton. By the KEGG pathway, we got 16 target genes and 92
   pathways of the miR-93-5p in prostate cancer. We also found that the
   miR-93-5p and its isomers can express in prostate cancer, and which with
   a high expression had a poor overall survival and a significant
   difference recurrence rate within 5 years. Further in vitro verification
   results demonstrated that the low expression of miR-93-5p can inhibit
   cell proliferation, migration, invasion, change cell cycle, and promote
   early apoptosis of PC-3 cells.
   ConclusionThe miR-93-5p and its target genes were used to define
   important molecular targets that could serve as a prognostic and
   predictive marker in the treatment of prostate cancer. Further research
   on the function of the miR-93-5p and its target genes in the KEGG
   pathway could provide references for the treatment of prostate cancer.

AB The abnormal expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is closely
   associated with human cancers. As one special group of lncRNAs, natural
   antisense transcripts (NATs) can be transcribed from both DNA strands at
   the same locus but in the opposite direction from the gene transcript.
   Their expression levels are altered in many cancers, but their roles are
   poorly understood. We strove to find NATs involved in human
   non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to reveal their mechanism of
   action in cancer. We analysed the NATs in NSCLC from the TCGA database
   by circlncRNAnet. One NAT, family with sequence similarity 83 member A
   antisense RNA 1 (FAM83A-AS1), was found to be markedly upregulated and
   positively correlated with its cognate sense counterpart, FAM83A, in
   NSCLC. Moreover, overexpression of FAM83A-AS1 increased FAM38A protein
   levels and induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation downstream of FAM83A in cells.
   Finally, overexpression of FAM83A-AS1 promoted LUAD cell proliferation
   and invasion. In summary, lncRNA FAM83A-AS1 promotes LUAD by increasing
   FAM83A expression.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by DNA methylation, which is
   associated with genomic instability and tumor initiation. As an
   important epigenetic regulation, DNA methylation can be used as a
   potential therapeutic target for CRC. In our study, we downloaded DNA
   methylation profiles (GSE17648 and GSE29490) and RNA sequencing
   microarray data (GSE25070 and GSE32323) from the Gene Expression Omnibus
   (GEO) database. As a result, 14 aberrantly methylated differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) were screened according to the different
   criteria. We further validated these DEGs in The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database and obtained Pearson's correlation coefficient (COR) for
   the relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation. Three
   candidate genes (SOX9, TCN1, and TGFBI) with COR greater than 0.3 were
   screened out as Hub genes. The receiver operating characteristic result
   indicated that SOX9 and TGFBI effectively serve as biomarkers for the
   early diagnosis of CRC. Furthermore, the potential prognosis of the Hub
   genes for CRC patients was evaluated. Only TGFBI, which is regulated by
   methylation, can predict patient disease-free survival. Additionally, we
   examined the methylation level of the Hub genes in CRC cells in the
   Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database. Considering that methylation
   status tends to be highly modified on CpG islands in tumorigenesis, we
   screened the CpG island methylation of TGFBI based on the TCGA database
   and verified its diagnostic value in the GEO database. Our result
   revealed two Hub genes (TCN1 and TGFBI) whose aberrant expressions were
   regulated by DNA methylation. Additionally, we uncovered the
   hypermethylation of TGFBI on CpG islands and its clinical value in the
   diagnosis of CRC.

AB BackgroundChicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II is
   known to play a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment. However, the
   role of NR2F2 in gliomas is unknown.MethodsThe genomic and clinical data
   of 530 cases of lower grade gliomas (LGGs) patients and 167 cases of
   glioblastoma (GBM) patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were
   extracted for analysis. R2 and UCSC Xena browser were used for
   Kaplan-Meier survival in the GSE16011 dataset and TCGA dataset,
   respectively. GraphPad Prism 7 was used to compare the differences in
   NR2F2 expression between various groups and subtypes.ResultsLGG patients
   with low NR2F2 expression had a significantly favorable outcome compared
   with those with high NR2F2 expression (p<0.05). By matching histological
   subtypes and gene expression profiles of LGG patients, grade II glioma
   group showed lowest levels of NR2F2 expression compared with grade III
   gliomas and GBM. Patients diagnosed with astrocytoma have highest
   expression of NR2F2 but lowest OS (p<0.05). In LGGs, NR2F2 expression
   was significantly downregulated in patient group with IDH mutation and
   1p19q co-deletion (p<0.05).ConclusionOur study suggests that NR2F2 can
   be used as a prognostic marker in LGG patients with IDH mutation and
   1p19 co-deletion.

AB Cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women.
   Novel prognostic biomarkers are required to predict the progression of
   cervical cancer. Cervical cancer expression data were obtained from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) significantly
   differentially expressed between early- and advanced-stage samples were
   identified by expression analysis. An optimal subset of signature miRNAs
   for pathologic stage prediction was delineated using the random forest
   algorithm and was used for the construction of a cervical
   cancer-specific support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The roles of
   signature miRNAs in cervical cancer were analyzed by functional
   annotation. In total, 44 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs
   were identified. An optimal subset of 7 signature miRNAs was identified,
   including hsa-miR-144, hsa-miR-147b, hsa-miR-218-2, hsa-miR-425,
   hsa-miR-451, hsa-miR-483 and hsa-miR-486. The signature miRNAs were used
   to construct an SVM classifier and exhibited a good performance in
   predicting pathologic stages of samples. SVM classification was found to
   be an independent prognostic factor. Functional enrichment analysis
   indicated that these signature miRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis. In
   conclusion, the subset of signature miRNAs could potentially serve as a
   novel diagnostic and prognostic predictor for cervical cancer.

AB Aberrantly expressed miRNAs play a crucial role in the progression of
   lung adenocarcinoma. However, to date, the role of miR-888 in lung
   adenocarcinoma progression is unclear. In the present study, the
   biological function of miR-888 and its underlying mechanism in lung
   adenocarcinoma progression were explored. RT-qPCR was performed to
   detect the expression of miR-888 in 38 matched lung adenocarcinoma
   samples respectively. Next, the effects of miR-888 on the proliferation,
   invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were evaluated
   by a series of gain- and loss-of-function assays. Our results revealed
   that miR-888 was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma
   tissues, and its expression was markedly associated with clinical
   staging in patients. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-888 in vitro
   was revealed to function as a double-edged sword in the progression of
   lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells by targeting multiple targets.
   Overexpression of miR-888 promoted the invasion and migration of lung
   adenocarcinoma A549 cells by targeting E-cadherin and tissue inhibitor
   of metalloproteinase 2. In addition, ectopic expression of miR-888
   inhibited the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells by
   targeting cell division cycle 7 (CDC7). In addition, the
   immunohistochemical results and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database
   revealed that CDC7 was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma
   tissues, suggesting that miR-888 may function as an oncogene in the
   progression of lung adenocarcinoma patients, and the miR-888/CDC7 axis
   was not the dominant pathway for CDC7 regulation in patients with lung
   adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, our findings indicated that miR-888 may
   act as a potential new therapeutic target for patients with lung
   adenocarcinoma.

AB BACKGROUND: We aimed at identifying molecular markers predictive of
   clinical outcome in patients with head and neck cancer based on the
   expression profile of cells showing epithelial-like (EL) or
   mesenchymal-like (ML) phenotypes.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the association between EL and ML
   cells and migration, drug resistance, or tumor growth. The differential
   gene expression profile between cell types was used to build a model to
   stratify patients according to survival.
   RESULTS: EL cells were sensitive to cisplatin and cetuximab, showed low
   migration, and generated squamous differentiated tumors in mouse. A
   differential 93-gene expression signature between ML and EL cells was
   used to build a three-gene (EFS, GPX2, and SPRR1A) survival model by
   analyzing the RNA-seq data of the TCGA-HNSC project. Its prognostic
   value was confirmed in two independent cohorts.
   CONCLUSION: EFS, GPX2, and SPRR1A are prognostic markers able to
   distinguish clinical outcome among subtypes sharing an EL phenotype.

AB PurposeCancer stem cells (CSC) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
   (EMT) pathways are crucial for cancer progression. However, synergistic
   interactions between CSC and EMT are not clear in non-small cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study was to investigate CSC
   markers such as CD44, NANOG, and ALDH1 expression and its correlation
   with EMT markers in NSCLC patients. Its association with survival was
   also determined.MethodsCD44, NANOG, and ALDH1 protein expression was
   evaluated in 267 resected NSCLC and its correlation with e-cadherin,
   -catenin, p120 catenin, vimentin, SNAIL, and TWIST expressions was
   determined based on immunohistochemical and mRNA expression data from
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Survival analyses also were
   performed based on immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression data from
   Gene Expression Omnibus dataset.ResultsALDH1 expression in lung
   adenocarcinoma was positively correlated with the epithelial-like
   phenotype, low vimentin and low TWIST in immunohistochemical and mRNA
   expression data. NANOG and ALDH1 expressions measured by
   immunohistochemical and mRNA expression profiling data of
   adenocarcinomas were associated with a favorable prognosis. ALDH1 was an
   independent favorable prognostic marker for overall survival or
   recurrence-free survival in adenocarcinoma (P=0.026 and P=0.033,
   respectively). The epithelial-like phenotype expressing P120-catenin and
   beta-catenin was associated with a favorable prognosis; however, the
   TWIST-expressing mesenchymal-like phenotype was correlated with an
   unfavorable prognosis.ConclusionsNANOG and ALDH1 protein or mRNA
   expression showed improved prognosis in adenocarcinoma alone. ALDH1
   expression correlated with an epithelial-like phenotype.

AB Immune checkpoint inhibition is effective in a subset of patients with
   advanced gastric cancer. Genomic profiling has revealed the
   heterogeneity of gastric adenocarcinomas, but the immune
   microenvironment and predictors of immunotherapy response remain poorly
   understood. We aimed to better characterize the underlying immune
   response to gastric cancer. Retrospective review of a prospectively
   maintained institutional database was performed to identify patients who
   underwent curative intent resection of gastric adenocarcinoma from 2006
   to 2016. Tumors were classified according to modified TCGA subtype:
   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated, microsatellite instability
   (MSI)-high, intestinal as a surrogate for chromosomal instability,
   diffuse as a surrogate for genomically stable. Tumor-infiltrating
   leukocytes were measured using immunohistochemistry. Forty-three
   patients were identified: 6 EBV, 11 MSI, 14 intestinal, 12 diffuse.
   Themost prevalent tumor-infiltrating leukocytes were CD8+ T lymphocytes
   and CD68+ macrophages, comprising 15% and 13% of all tumor cells. EBV
   and MSI tumors were the most infiltrated, harboring 30% to 50% T cells
   and 20% macrophages. Intestinal tumors contained fewer T cells but
   disproportionately more macrophages. Diffuse tumors were the least
   infiltrated. Programmed cell death protein 1 was most frequently
   expressed in intestinal tumors, whereas 70% of EBV and MSI tumors
   expressed programmed death-ligand 1. We herein demonstrate a
   heterogenous immune response to gastric cancer, which varies by tumor
   subtype and has implications for future immunotherapy trials. Checkpoint
   inhibition is unlikely to be effective as single-agent therapy against
   intestinal and diffuse tumors lacking prominent T-cell infiltration or
   substantial programmed death-ligand 1 expression.

AB BackgroundReversible N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modifications in
   messenger RNAs can be categorized under the field of RNA epigenetics.
   However, the potential role of m(6)A-related genes in gastric cancer
   (GC) prognosis has not been systematically researched.AimsThis study was
   aimed at providing insights into the prognostic role of m(6)A-related
   gene expression, at both mRNA and protein levels.MethodsKaplan-Meier
   (KM) plotter database and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were
   used to explore the prognostic significance of individual m(6)A-related
   genes in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival at the mRNA
   level. For independent validation, the protein level of genes
   significantly associated with prognosis in both databases was further
   detected in 450 paired GC and corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues
   using tissue microarray (TMA)-based immunohistochemistry (IHC). The
   relationship between the FTO and ALKBH1 expression and the
   clinicopathological characteristics was explored.ResultsAmong nine
   m(6)A-related genes, aberrantly high mRNA expression of FTO and ALKBH1
   was associated with poor OS in the KM and TCGA cohorts. However, the
   TMA-IHC indicated that protein expression of FTO and ALKBH1 was markedly
   downregulated in GC tissues. A lower protein level of ALKBH1 was closely
   correlated with larger tumor sizes (5cm) and more advanced TNM stages,
   while lower FTO protein expression was associated with shorter OS in GC
   patients.ConclusionsAberrant expression of demethylase genes, FTO and
   ALKBH1, has a distinct prognostic value in GC patients, indicating that
   FTO and ALKBH1 may play vital roles in GC progression and metastasis.

AB Objectives: The current treatment of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
   (LSCC) is based on radical surgery and radiotherapy resulting in high
   morbidity. Chemoradiotherapy has been used as alternative to organ
   sparing; however, several advanced cases presented resistance to
   treatment, which contributes to a high risk of recurrence and mortality.
   Coding RNAs and miRNAs have potential to be used as biomarkers or
   targets for cancer therapy.
   Materials and Methods: In this study, 36 LSCC and 5 non-neoplastic
   control samples were investigated using miRNA and mRNA large-scale
   expression analysis and a cross-validation was performed using the TCGA
   database (116 LSCC and 12 surrounding normal tissues).
   Results: The large-scale profiling revealed the involvement of 28 miRNAs
   and 817 genes differentially expressed in LSCC. An integrative analysis
   comprising predicted and experimentally validated miRNA/mRNA
   interactions (negatively correlated), resulted in 28 miRNAs and 543
   mRNAs. Decreased expression of miR-199b was significantly associated
   with shorter disease-free survival in LSCC (internal and TCGA datasets).
   The expression levels of selected miRNAs (miR-199b-5p, miR-29c-3p,
   miR-204-5p, miR-125b-5p and miR-92a-3p) and genes (COL3A1, COL10A1,
   ERBB4, HMGA2, HLF, TOP2A, MMP3, MMP13, MMP10 and PPP1R3) were confirmed
   as altered in LSCC by RT-qPCR. Additionally, a drug target prediction
   analysis revealed drug combinations based on miRNA and mRNA expression,
   pointing out novel alternatives to optimize the LSCC treatment.
   Conclusion: Collectively, these findings provide new insights in the
   LSCC transcriptional deregulation and potential drug targets.

AB Zinc-figure protein 217 (ZNF217) is a C2H2 zinc finger transcription
   factor that works as a pivotal effector stimulating embryonic
   immortalization as well as oncogenicity during multiple cancer
   processes. Nevertheless, the expression of ZNF217 in hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying specific molecular mechanisms remains
   elusive. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential role of
   ZNF217 in HCC cell proliferation and invasion, as well as the underlying
   mechanism. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of ZNF217 was
   higher in HCC patients and indicated worse overall survival times, which
   was confirmed by Oncomine datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   HCC cohorts. Further research discovered that knockdown of ZNF217
   inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Enforced
   expression of ZNF217 could promote Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
   thus the invasion of HCC cells. Mechanistically, we identified ZNF217
   interacted with LSD1 in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of ZNF217 was
   accompanied by a parallel increase in di-methyl histone 3 lysine4 levels
   on CDH1 promoter, which indicated ZNF217 could recruit LSD1 to affect
   CDH1 epigenetic expression from transcription level. Of note,
   bioinformatics analyses, a dual luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR and
   western blot analysis demonstrated that microRNA-101 (miR-101), a
   well-known tumor suppressor in HCC, acted as a negative regulator of
   ZNF217. The inhibition of HCC progression by miR-101 was counteracted by
   ZNF217 overexpression. Taken together, our study presents the regulation
   mechanism of miR-101/ZNF217/CDH1 axis for the first time and provides
   new evidences of ZNF217 as a potential therapeutic target for HCC
   patients.

AB Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant tumors. Invasion and
   metastasis can occur in the early stage of pancreatic cancer,
   contributing to the poor prognosis. Accordingly, in this study, we
   evaluated the molecular mechanisms underlying invasion and metastasis.
   Using mass spectrometry, we found that Integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) was more
   highly expressed in a highly invasive pancreatic cancer cell line
   (PC-1.0) than in a less invasive cell line (PC-1). Through in vitro and
   in vivo experiments, we observed significant decreases in invasion and
   metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells after inhibiting ITGA6. Based on
   data in TCGA, high ITGA6 expression significantly predicted poor
   prognosis. By using Co-IP combined mass spectrometry, we found that
   ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), which was also highly expressed in PC-1.0,
   interacted with ITGA6. Similar to ITGA6, high RPSA expression promoted
   invasion and metastasis and indicated poor prognosis. Interestingly,
   although ITGA6 and RPSA interacted, they did not mutually regulate each
   other. ITGA6 and RPSA affected invasion and metastasis via the PI3K and
   MAPK signaling pathways, respectively. Inhibiting ITGA6 significantly
   reduced the expression of p-AKT, while inhibiting RPSA led to the
   downregulation of p-ERK1/2. Compared with the inhibition of ITGA6 or
   RPSA alone, the downregulation of both ITGA6 and RPSA weakened invasion
   and metastasis to a greater extent and led to the simultaneous
   downregulation of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2. Our research indicates that the
   development of drugs targeting both ITGA6 and RPSA may be an effective
   strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

AB In the present study, gene expression data of hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC) were analyzed by using a multi-step Bioinformatics approach to
   establish a novel prognostic prediction system. Gene expression profiles
   were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression
   Omnibus (GEO) databases. The overlapping differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) between these two datasets were identified using the limma
   package in R. Prognostic genes were further identified by Cox regression
   using the survival package. The significantly co-expressed gene pairs
   were selected using the R function cor to construct the co-expression
   network. Functional and module analyses were also performed. Next, a
   prognostic prediction system was established by Bayes discriminant
   analysis using the discriminant.bayes function in the e1071 package,
   which was further validated in another independent GEO dataset. A total
   of 177 overlapping DEGs were identified from TCGA and the GEO dataset
   (GSE36376). Furthermore, 161 prognostic genes were selected and the top
   six were stanniocalcin 2, carbonic anhydrase 12, cell division cycle
   (CDC) 20, deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3, glucosylceramidase beta3 and
   metallothionein 1G. A gene co-expression network involving 41
   upregulated and 52 downregulated genes was constructed. SPC24,
   endothelial cell specific molecule 1, CDC20, CDCA3, cyclin (CCN) E1 and
   chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 were significantly
   associated with cell division, mitotic cell cycle and positive
   regulation of cell proliferation. CCNB1, CCNE1, CCNB2 and stratifin were
   clearly associated with the p53 signaling pathway. A prognostic
   prediction system containing 55 signature genes was established and then
   validated in the GEO dataset GSE20140. In conclusion, the present study
   identified a number of prognostic genes and established a prediction
   system to assess the prognosis of HCC patients.

AB The p53 protein is a tumour suppressor and transcription factor that
   regulates the expression of target genes involved in numerous stress
   responses systems. In this study, we designed a screening strategy using
   DNA damage‑induced mouse and human transcriptome data to identify novel
   downstream targets of p53. Our method selected genes with an induced
   expression in multiple organs of X‑ray‑irradiated p53 wild‑type mice.
   The expression of inka box actin regulator 2gene, known as Inka2, was
   upregulated in 12organs when p53 expression was induced. Similarly,
   INKA2 was induced in a p53‑dependent manner at both the mRNA and protein
   level in human cells treated with adriamycin. Reporter assays confirmed
   that p53 directly regulated INKA2 through an intronic binding site. The
   overexpression of INKA2 produced a slight decrease in cancer cell growth
   in the colony formation assay. Moreover, the analysis of The Cancer
   Genome Atlas(TCGA) data revealed a decreased INKA2 expression in tumour
   samples carrying p53 mutations compared with p53 wild‑type samples. In
   addition, significantly higher levels of DNA methylation were observed
   in the INKA2 promoter in tumour samples, concordant with the reduced
   INKA2 expression in tumour tissues. These results demonstrate the
   potential of INKA2 as a cancer cell growth inhibitor. Furthermore, INKA2
   protein interacts with the serine/threonine‑protein kinase, p21(RAC1)
   activated kinase(PAK)4, which phosphorylates beta‑catenin to prevent
   ubiquitin‑proteasomal degradation. As beta‑catenin was downregulated in
   a stable INKA2‑expressing cell line, the findings of this study suggest
   that INKA2 is a novel, direct downstream target of p53 that potentially
   decreases cell growth by inhibiting the PAK4‑beta‑catenin pathway.

AB Studies have rarely been conducted on the role of miRNAs in prostate
   cancer (PCa) cell progression by directly targeting MTDH, at least to
   the best of our knowledge. Thus, the present study aimed to identify
   miRNAs closely related with metadherin (MTDH) and to determine their
   roles in PCa. For this purpose, the expression levels of MTDH in PCa
   tissues and cell lines were examined by RT‑qPCR, immunohistochemistry
   and western blot analysis. By cell transfection, MTDH was either
   overexpressed in the normal prostate epithelial cell lines or silenced
   in tumor cell lines to determine cell viability, invasion and migration.
   Bioinformatics analysis, RT‑qPCR, western blot analysis, dual‑luciferase
   reporter assay and MTT assay were performed to identify direct the
   target of MTDH and to examine tumor cell viability. Rescue experiments
   using the PC‑3 and LNCaP cells were carried out by MTT assay, scratch
   wound assay, Transwell assay, RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis.
   Experiments were also conducted using 46 PCa human cancer and adjacent
   tissues, as wells as on 501cases of PCa from the TCGA database. It was
   confirmed that the overexpression of MTDH was associated with a poor
   prognosis of patients. The overexpression of MTDH was found to promote
   the viability, invasion and migration of PCa cells. miR‑145‑5p and
   miR‑145‑3p identified from 16 miRNAs were found to be closely related to
   PCa and to be the targets of MTDH. Both these miRNAs were found to
   significantly suppress the growth and metastasis of PCa cells by
   negatively regulating the expression of MTDH. On the whole, the findings
   of this study demonstrate that MTDH functions as an oncogene in PCa and
   the inhibition of MTDH by miR‑145‑5p or miR‑145‑3p suppressed the growth
   and metastasis of PCa cells. The miR‑145‑5p/MTDH and miR‑145‑3p/MTDH
   pathways may thus become novel treatment targets for PCa.

   focusing on the role of interferon‑gamma (IFN‑gamma), and the clinical
   indications for anti‑programmed cell death1 (PD‑1) /anti‑PD‑L1
   immunotherapy. We evaluated PD‑L1 expression in 4 breast cancer cell
   lines in the presence of 3types of inhibitors, as well as IFN‑gamma. The
   expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of
   transcription1 (p‑STAT1), one of the IFN‑gamma signaling pathway
   molecules, was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in relation to
   PD‑L1 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression on cancer
   cells and tumor‑infiltrating CD8‑positive T cells in 111patients with
   stageII/III breast cancer. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database, the correlation of the IFN‑gamma signature with PD‑L1
   expression was analyzed in breast invasive carcinoma tissues. As a
   result, the JAK/STAT pathway via IFN‑gamma was mainly involved in PD‑L1
   expression in the cell lines examined. IHC analysis revealed that the
   PD‑L1 and HLA class I expression levels were significantly upregulated
   in the p‑STAT1‑positive cases. TCGA analysis indicated that the PD‑L1
   expression and IFN‑gamma signature exhibited a positive correlation. On
   the whole, these findings suggest that PD‑L1 and HLA classI are
   co‑expressed in p‑STAT1‑positive breast cancer cells induced by
   IFN‑gamma secreted from tumor infiltrating immune cells, and that
   p‑STAT1 expression may be a potential biomarker for patient selection
   for immunotherapy with anti‑PD‑1/anti‑PD‑L1 monoclonal antibodies.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to state the role of BAG2 in
   oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC).
   DESIGN: Expression data of BAG2 in OSCC tissues were extracted from
   Oncomine and TCGA database. Expression levels of BAG2 mRNA and protein
   were examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
   reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot assay. The Kaplan-Meier method was
   conducted to evaluate the overall survival of OSCC patients. Small
   interfering RNAs (siRNAs) strategy was used to confirm the effect of
   BAG2 expression on proliferative, invasive, migrated capacities of OSCC
   cells by Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colon formation assay, wound
   healing and transwell assay.
   RESULTS: Our results showed that BAG2 expression was up-regulated in
   oral squamous cell carcinomas tissues. Compared with OSCC patients with
   low BAG2 expression, poorer overall survival rate was found in OSCC
   patients with high BAG2 expression. Furthermore, proliferation, invasion
   and migration of HO-1-N-1 cells were significantly inhibited because of
   the knockdown of BAG2. Transfection of si-BAG2has no impacts on
   proliferation in HNOEC cells. Inhibition of BAG2 downregulated the
   expression of relevant proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear
   antigen (PCNA), c-Myc, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and Vimentin.
   Additionally, the expression levels of the important protein
   phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK) in mitogen-activated protein kinase
   (MAPK) pathway were reduced in HO-1-N-1 cells transfected with si-BAG2.
   CONCLUSIONS: High-regulated BAG2 is related to poor prognosis and could
   promote proliferation, invasion and migration of OSCC cells by
   activating the MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, BAG2 may be a potential
   target for OSCC therapy.

AB Previous studies have suggested that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are
   closely associated with human diseases, particularly cancer, including
   cancer of the lung, breast and stomach. A variety of lncRNAs are
   abnormally expressed in cancer and participate in several pathways
   including cell proliferation and apoptosis; these elements are closely
   associated with the development of cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) is an important cancer database. It consists of clinical data,
   genomic variation, mRNA, microRNA (miRNA) and lncRNAs expression,
   methylation and other data for various types of human cancer. In the
   present study, differential expression of RNA was identified using the
   edgeR package. A total 1,222RNA sequencing profiles from patients with
   breast cancer were downloaded from TCGA. A competing endogenous RNA
   (ceRNA) network was constructed for breast cancer based on miRcode and
   miRTarBase. The top10 lncRNAs were selected using Cox regression
   analysis. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan‑Meier analysis. A
   total of 1,028breast cancer‑associated lncRNAs and 89miRNAs (fold change
   >2; P<0.05) were identified; among these, 93lncRNAs and 19miRNAs were
   included in the ceRNA network. Subsequently, 10 basic lncRNAs were
   selected and their associations with overall survival were identified.
   In addition, 5 lncRNAs (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type1
   motif9‑antisense RNA1, AL513123.1, chromosome10 open reading frame126,
   long intergenic non‑protein coding RNA536 and Wilms tumor1 antisense
   RNA) were identified to be significantly associated with overall
   survival (P<0.05, log rank test). These results suggested that mRNAs,
   lncRNAs and miRNAs were involved in pathological mechanisms of breast
   cancer. The newly‑identified ceRNA network included 93breast
   cancer‑specific lncRNAs, 19miRNAs and 27mRNAs. The results of the
   present study highlight the potential of lncRNAs in understanding the
   development and pathogenesis of breast cancer, and suggest novel
   concepts and an experimental basis for the identification of prognostic
   biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

AB The aim of the present study was to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) or
   long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signatures of laryngeal cancer recurrence
   and to investigate the regulatory mechanisms associated with this
   malignancy. Datasets of recurrent and nonrecurrent laryngeal cancer
   samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene
   Expression Omnibus database (GSE27020 and GSE25727) to examine
   differentially expressed miRNAs (DE‑miRs), lncRNAs (DE‑lncRs) and mRNAs
   (DEGs). miRNA‑mRNA and lncRNA‑miRNA networks were constructed by
   investigating the associations among these RNAs in various databases.
   Subsequently, the interactions identified were combined into a competing
   endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network. Feature genes in the
   miRNA‑mRNA network were identified via topological analysis and a
   recursive feature elimination algorithm. A support vector machine (SVM)
   classifier was established using the betweenness centrality values in
   the miRNA‑mRNA network, consisting of 32optimal feature‑coding genes.
   The classification effect was tested using two validation datasets.
   Furthermore, coding genes in the ceRNA network were examined via pathway
   enrichment analyses. In total, 21DE‑lncRs, 507DEGs and 55DE‑miRs were
   selected. The SVM classifier exhibited an accuracy of 94.05% (79/84) for
   sample classification prediction in the TCGA dataset, and 92.66and91.07%
   in the two validation datasets. The ceRNA regulatory network comprised
   203nodes, corresponding to mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs, and 346lines,
   corresponding to the interactions among RNAs. In particular, the
   interactions with the highest scores were HLA complex group4
   (HCG4)‑miR‑33b, HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR)‑miR‑1‑MAGE family
   memberA2 (MAGEA2), EMX2 opposite strand/antisense RNA
   (EMX2OS)‑miR‑124‑calcitonin related polypeptidealpha (CALCA) and
   EMX2OS‑miR‑124‑gamma‑aminobutyric acid type A receptorgamma2 subunit
   (GABRG2). Gene enrichment analysis of the genes in the ceRNA network
   identified that 11pathway terms and 16 molecular function terms were
   significantly enriched. The SVM classifier based on 32feature coding
   genes exhibited high accuracy in the classification of laryngeal cancer
   samples. miR‑1, miR‑33b, miR‑124, HOTAIR, HCG4 and EMX2OS may be novel
   biomarkers of recurrent laryngeal cancer, and HCG4‑miR‑33b,
   HOTAIR‑miR‑1‑MAGEA2 and EMX2OS‑miR‑124‑CALCA/GABRG2 may be associated
   with the molecular mechanisms regulating recurrent laryngeal cancer.

AB Immune-checkpoint therapy has failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical
   benefit in unselected cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but a
   subset of PDACs are known to upregulate pathways involved in acquired
   immune suppression. Further delineation of immunologic subtypes of PDAC
   is necessary to improve clinical trial designs and identify patients who
   might benefit from immune-checkpoint therapy. We used clinical survival
   and RNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to
   investigate the relationship between immune-modulating pathways and
   immune subset markers and their impact on survival in PDAC patients. Of
   the adaptive immune-resistance pathways, expression of PD-L1 and IDO1
   was individually associated with poor survival. Although CD8 expression
   alone was not correlated with survival, the combination of PD-L1- and
   high CD8 expression identified a subtype with favorable survival. We
   further extended these observations using an independent PDAC cohort
   from our institution via IHC, again observing that the PD-L1-/CD8high
   subtype was associated with positive prognosis. Although PDAC is
   regarded as a poorly immunogenic cancer type, these findings infer that
   T-cell infiltration in the absence of adaptive immune-resistance
   pathways is a feature of long-term survival in PDAC and imply the
   importance of developing future immunotherapeutic strategies based on
   data-supported biomarkers to refine patient selection.

AB Targeting inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) with second

   cancer cell death. We tested whether cIAP1 predicts poor prognosis in
   head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and whether a novel
   Smac-mimetic, LCL161, could radiosensitize human papillomavirus-positive
   (HPV+) and -negative (HPV-) HNSCC. The association of BIRC2 (encoding
   cIAP1) mRNA level with HPV status in HNSCC was analyzed using The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. cIAP1 was assessed by IHC on an HNSCC
   tissue microarray (TMA, n = 84) followed by correlation analysis with
   HPV status and patient outcomes. Human cell culture and animal models of
   HNSCC were used to analyze the outcome and molecular characteristics
   following radiotherapy in combination with LCL161. cIAP1 expression is
   increased in HPV- compared with HPV+HNSCC tumors in the TCGA database.
   In our TMA, cIAP1 was overexpressed in HNSCC compared with normal
   tissues (P = 0.0003) and associated with a poor overall survival (P =
   0.0402). cIAP1 levels were higher in HPV- than that in HPV+HNSCC tumors
   (P = 0.004) and patients with cIAP1+/HPV- HNSCC had the worst survival.
   LCL161 effectively radiosensitized HPV- HNSCC cells, which was
   accompanied with enhanced apoptosis, but not HPV+ HNSCC cells.
   Importantly, LCL161 in combination with radiotherapy led to dramatic
   tumor regression of HPV- HNSCC tumor xenografts, accompanied by cIAP1
   degradation and apoptosis activation. These results reveal that cIAP1 is
   a prognostic and a potential therapeutic biomarker for HNSCC, and
   targeting cIAP1 with LCL161 preferentially radiosensitizes HPV- HNSCC,
   providing justification for clinical testing of LCL161 in combination
   with radiation for patients with HPV- HNSCC.

AB Background and Objective: Head and neck cancer is a malignant tumor that
   begins in the head and neck region, and has the sixth highest incidence
   worldwide. Previous studies have indicated several prognostic markers
   for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but due to poor
   accuracy and sensitivity of these clinical characteristic markers
   attention has been gradually switched to molecular biomarkers. This
   study aimed to sort out the mRNAs correlated with patient survival time
   to establish an mRNA combination prognostic biomarker model for HNSCC
   patient risk stratification, providing optimal therapeutic regimens and
   improving patient prognosis.
   Methods: Clinical data and transcriptome sequencing data of HNSCC were
   retrieved from TCGA database and were allocated into training and
   validation datasets. The prognostic model was established using the
   mRNAs, which were sorted out from training dataset by a significant
   correlation with survival time. Eventually, the prediction property of
   the model was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
   Results: An optimal prognostic model by the combination of six mRNAs was
   established. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed effective risk
   stratification by this model for patients in the two datasets. The area
   under ROC curve (AUC) was >0.65 for training and validation datasets,
   indicating good sensitivity and specificity of this model. Moreover,
   prominent superiority of this model to investigate prognostic biomarkers
   was demonstrated.
   Conclusion: Our model provided effective prognostication in terms of
   death risk stratification and evaluation in HNSCC patients. Combination
   of this prognostic model with current treatment measures is expected to
   greatly improve the patients' prognosis.

AB Patient survival time generally reflects the tumor progression and
   represents a key clinical parameter. In this study, we aimed to
   comprehensively characterize the prognosis-associated molecular
   alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study,
   copy-number changes, gene mutations, mRNA expression, and reverse phase
   protein arrays data in HCC samples profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) were obtained. Tumors were then stratified into two groups based
   on the clinical outcome and identified genomic, transcriptomic, and
   proteomic traits associated to HCC prognosis. We found that several copy
   number amplifications and deletions can discriminate HCC patients with
   poor prognosis from those with better prognosis. Mutated DNAH8 showed a
   worse prognosis-specific pattern and correlated with a reduced
   disease-free survival in HCC. By integrating RNA sequencing data, we
   found that HCC samples with poor prognosis are consistently associated
   with the up-regulation of cell cycle process, such as chromosome
   separation, DNA replication, cytokinesis, and etc. At the proteomic
   level, seven proteins were significantly enriched in samples with poor
   prognosis, including acetylated alpha-Tubulin, p62-LCK-ligand, ARID1A,
   MSH6, B-Raf, Cyclin B1, and PEA15. Acetylated alpha-Tubulin was
   frequently expressed in HCC tissues and acted as a promising prognostic
   factor for HCC. These alterations lay a foundation for developing
   relevant therapeutic strategies and improve our knowledge of the
   pathogenesis of HCC.

AB Accumulating evidence suggested that YrdC involved in growth, telomere
   homeostasis, translation and the N6-threonylcarbamoylation (t6A) of tRNA
   was abnormally expressed in the progression of tumor. However, the role
   of YrdC in hepatocellular carcinoma remained elusive. Our study aimed to
   investigate the clinical significance and oncogenic phenotypes of YrdC
   in hepatocellular carcinoma, and to determine its related mechanism of
   this disease. With the usage of GEO datasets, we analyzed the expression
   of YrdC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Kaplan-Meier survival
   analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of
   hepatocellular carcinoma patients in TCGA. Gain- and loss-of-function
   analyses in vitro of YrdC were also performed to evaluate its effects on
   oncogenic phenotypes and relevant signaling pathways. YrdC expression
   was not only dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue but also
   related to the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In
   addition, YrdC depletion suppressed the capability of proliferation,
   migration and invasion of huh7 cells, while there was opposite result
   for YrdC overexpression. Our data also unraveled that YrdC promoted the
   progression of HCC by activating MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Together,
   our findings indicated that YrdC was a potential prognosis marker for
   hepatocellular carcinoma, and therapeutic strategies targeting YrdC
   might hold promise in improving the treatment of hepatocellular
   carcinoma.

AB Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, with the
   highest incidence rate worldwide. Dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs
   during the preliminary stages of breast carcinogenesis is poorly
   understood. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing to identify long
   noncoding RNA expression profiles associated with early-stage breast
   cancer. RNA sequencing was performed on six invasive ductal carcinoma
   (IDC) tissues along with paired normal tissue samples, seven ductal
   carcinoma insitu tissues, and five apparently normal breast tissues. We
   identified 375 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) in IDC
   tissues compared to paired normal tissues. Antisense transcripts (~58%)
   were the largest subtype among DElncRNAs. About 20% of the 375 DElncRNAs
   were supported by typical split readings leveraging their detection
   confidence. Validation was performed in n=52 IDC and paired normal
   tissue by qRT-PCR for the identified targets (ADAMTS9-AS2, EPB41L4A-AS1,
   WDFY3-AS2, RP11-295M3.4, RP11-161M6.2, RP11-490M8.1, CTB-92J24.3, and
   FAM83H-AS1). We evaluated the prognostic significance of DElncRNAs based
   on TCGA datasets and report that overexpression of FAM83H-AS1 was
   associated with patient poor survival. We confirmed that the
   downregulation of ADAMTS9-AS2 in breast cancer was due to promoter
   hypermethylation through invitro silencing experiments and
   pyrosequencing.

AB INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain
   cancer. The average survival time for the majority of patients is
   approximately 15months after diagnosis. A major feature of GBM that
   contributes to its poor prognosis is its high invasiveness. Caveolae are
   plasma membrane subdomains that participate in numerous biological
   functions. Caveolin-1 and Caveolae Associated Protein 1 (CAVIN1),
   formerly termed Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor, are both
   necessary for caveola formation. We hypothesized that high expression of
   caveola-forming proteins in GBM promotes invasiveness via modulation of
   the production of matrix-degrading enzymes.
   METHODS: The mRNA expression of caveola-forming proteins and matrix
   proteases in GBM samples, and survival after stratifying patients
   according to caveolin-1 or CAVIN1 expression, were analyzed from TCGA
   and REMBRANDT databases. The proteolytic profile of cell lines
   expressing or devoid of caveola-forming proteins was investigated using
   zymography and real-time qPCR. Invasion through basement membrane-like
   protein was investigated in vitro.
   RESULTS: Expression of both caveolin-1 and CAVIN1 was increased in GBM
   compared to normal samples and correlated with expression of urokinase
   plasminogen activator (uPA) and gelatinases. High expression of
   caveola-forming proteins was associated with shorter survival time. GBM
   cell lines capable of forming caveolae expressed more uPA and matrix
   metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and/or -9 (MMP-9) and were more invasive
   than GBM cells devoid of caveola-forming proteins. Experimental
   manipulation of caveolin-1 or CAVIN1 expression in GBM cells
   recapitulated some, but not all of these features. Caveolae modulate GBM
   cell invasion in part via matrix protease expression.

AB miRNA‑223 (miR‑223) has been reported to function not only as a tumor
   suppressor, but also as an oncogenic microRNA (miRNA or miR) in various
   cancer cells. Therefore, the functional role of miR‑223 has not been
   elucidated to date, at least to the best of our knowledge. We previously
   performed the deep sequencing analysis of clinical bladder cancer(BC)
   specimens. It was revealed that miR‑223 expression was significantly
   downregulated in BC, suggesting that miR‑223 functions as a tumor
   suppressor miRNA in BC. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   functional roles of miR‑223 and to identify its targets in BC. The
   expression levels of miR‑223 were significantly decreased in our
   clinical BC specimens. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database indicated
   that miR‑223 expression was related to lymphovascular invasion and
   distant metastasis. The restoration of miR‑223 expression significantly
   inhibited tumor aggressiveness and induced apoptosis via caspase‑3/7
   activation in BC cells. WD repeat domain62(WDR62), a candidate target of
   miR‑223 according to insilico analyses, has been previously proposed to
   play a role in neurodevelopment. Direct binding between WDR62 and
   miR‑223 was confirmed by luciferase assay. The TCGA database revealed
   positive associations between WDR62 mRNA expression and a higher tumor
   grade and stage in BC. The knockdown of WDR62 significantly inhibited
   tumor aggressiveness and induced the apoptosis of BC cells. On the
   whole, the findings of this study reveal a novel miR‑223 target,
   oncogenic WDR62, and provided insight into the oncogenesis of BC.

AB The roles of miRNAs in lung cancer have not yet been explored
   systematically at the genome scale despite their important regulatory
   functions. Here, we report an integrative analysis of miRNA and mRNA
   sequencing data for matched tumor-normal samples from 109 Korean female
   patients with non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We produced
   miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq) and RNA-Seq data for 48 patients and
   RNA-Seq data for 61 additional patients. Subsequent differential
   expression analysis with stringent criteria yielded 44 miRNAs and 2322
   genes. Integrative gene set analysis of the differentially expressed
   miRNAs and genes using miRNA-target information revealed several
   regulatory processes related to the cell cycle that were targeted by
   tumor suppressor miRNAs (TSmiR). We performed colony formation assays in
   A549 and NCI-H460 cell lines to test the tumor-suppressive activity of
   downregulated miRNAs in cancer and identified 7 novel TSmiRs
   (miR-144-5p, miR-218-1-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-27a-5p, miR-30a-3p,
   miR-30c-2-3p, miR-338-5p). Two miRNAs, miR-30a-3p and miR-30c-2-3p,
   showed differential survival characteristics in the Tumor Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) LUAD patient cohort indicating their prognostic value.
   Finally, we identified a network cluster of miRNAs and target genes that
   could be responsible for cell cycle regulation. Our study not only
   provides a dataset of miRNA as well as mRNA sequencing from the matched
   tumor-normal samples, but also reports several novel TSmiRs that could
   potentially be developed into prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic RNA
   drugs.

AB AIMS: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer incidence and
   mortality. Although cigarette smoke is regarded as a high risk factor
   for lung tumor initiation, the role of the lung tumor suppressor GPRC5A
   in smoking-induced lung cancer is unclear.
   MAIN METHODS: We obtained two lung cancer cohorts from the TCGA and GEO
   databases. Bioinformatics analysis showed differential gene expression
   in the cohorts. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western Blot and Gprc5a-/-
   mice uncovered the relationship between cigarette smoke and lung cancer
   in the GPRC5A deletion system in vitro and in vivo.
   KEY FINDINGS: Bioinformatics analysis showed that the smoking lung
   cancer patients with low expression of GPRC5A had poor overall survival
   compared to the patients with high GPRC5A expression. Further analysis
   revealed that cancer-related stemness pathways such as the Hippo
   signaling pathway were induced in smoking patients with low GPRC5A
   expression. Additionally, we detected enriched expression of WNT5A and
   DLX5 in normal human lung epithelial 16HBE cells and human lung cancer
   H1299 cells in vitro. A relationship between cigarette smoke extract
   (NNK) and lung tumor initiation was observed in Gprc5a-/- mice.
   SIGNIFICANCE: The lung tumor suppressor gene GPRC5A played a protective
   role in cigarette smoke-induced lung tumor initiation, providing a
   target for the prevention of lung cancer development and monitoring of
   prognosis.

   for occurrence and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC), and simultaneously to investigate the potential role of lncRNAs
   in the oncogenesis of HCC. The lncRNAs expression data and the
   corresponding clinical information of HCC samples were extracted from
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The differentially expressed
   genes and lncRNAs were identified and the correlation networks were
   constructed. In this study, we identified 212 differentially expressed
   lncRNAs and 7,577 differentially expressed genes between liver HCC tumor
   tissues and normal tissue samples. And then, combining with clinical
   information, a total of 11 lncRNAs and 162 genes as HCC biomarkers were
   identified by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Further, through
   coexpress network analysis, we confirmed four lncRNAs
   (lncRNA_ANKRD10.IT1, lncRNA_CTD.2583A14.8, lncRNA_RP11.404P21.3, and
   lncRNA_RP11.488L18.10), which can serve as prognostic biomarkers for
   HCC. The four lncRNAs identified in this study may serve as a potential
   therapy target for HCC.

AB Immunotherapy against the interaction between programmed cell death
   1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a promising
   strategy for colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or
   microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). The study aimed to identify
   miRNAs that posttranscriptionally control PD-L1 expression on tumor
   cells and also regulate immune evasion. A comprehensive miRNA screening
   using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (n = 260) combined with
   eight different miRNA target prediction programs resulted in the
   identification of a tumor suppressive miRNA, miR-148a-3p, as a potential
   negative regulator of PD-L1 expression, particularly in dMMR/MSI-H
   colorectal cancer. Using multiple cohorts of colorectal cancer,
   including TCGA data, a microarray dataset (n = 148), and formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedded samples (n = 395), we found that the expression of
   miR-148a-3p was decreased in dMMR/MSI-H tumors, correlating inversely
   with PD-L1 levels. We demonstrate that miR-148a-3p directly binds to the
   3'-untranslated region of PD-L1, thereby reducing whole-cell and cell
   surface PD-L1 levels in HCT116 and SW837 cell lines. Overexpression of
   miR-148a-3p repressed IFNgamma-induced PD-L1 expression on tumor cells
   and consequently diminished T-cell apoptosis in a coculture model of
   IL2-activated T cells and IFNgamma-treated tumor cells. In conclusion,
   our data support a regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 expression on tumor
   cells and immune suppression via miR-148a-3p downregulation in
   colorectal cancer. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides novel evidence that
   miR-148a-3p negatively regulates tumor cell PD-L1 expression and
   decreased levels of miR-148a-3p contributes to the immunosuppressive
   tumor microenvironment.

AB PURPOSE: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy
   with few therapies; however, patients with locoregional disease have
   variable outcomes. The Cancer Genome Atlas project on ACC (ACC-TCGA)
   identified that cancers of patients with homogeneously rapidly recurrent
   or fatal disease bear a unique CpG island hypermethylation phenotype,
   "CIMP-high." We sought to identify a biomarker that faithfully captures
   this subgroup.Experimental Design: We analyzed ACC-TCGA data to
   characterize differentially regulated biological processes, and identify
   a biomarker that is methylated and silenced exclusively in CIMP-high
   ACC. In an independent cohort of 114 adrenocortical tumors (80
   treatment-naive primary ACC, 22 adrenocortical adenomas, and 12
   non-naive/nonprimary ACC), we evaluated biomarker methylation by a
   restriction digest/qPCR-based approach, validated by targeted bisulfite
   sequencing. We evaluated expression of this biomarker and additional
   prognostic markers by qPCR.
   RESULTS: We show that CIMP-high ACC is characterized by upregulation of
   cell cycle and DNA damage response programs, and identify that
   hypermethylation and silencing of G0S2 distinguishes this subgroup. We
   confirmed G0S2 hypermethylation and silencing is exclusive to 40% of
   ACC, and independently predicts shorter disease-free and overall
   survival (median 14 and 17 months, respectively). Finally, G0S2
   methylation combined with validated molecular markers (BUB1B-PINK1)
   stratifies ACC into three groups, with uniformly favorable,
   intermediate, and uniformly dismal outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: G0S2 hypermethylation is a hallmark of rapidly recurrent or
   fatal ACC, amenable to targeted assessment using routine molecular
   diagnostics. Assessing G0S2 methylation is straightforward, feasible for
   clinical decision-making, and will enable the direction of efficacious
   adjuvant therapies for patients with aggressive ACC.

AB Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a histone modifier that is
   highly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma, which results in aggressive
   tumor biology. Tumor cell proliferation and migration analysis after
   LSD1 inhibition in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line PC9, using the LSD1
   inhibitor HCI-2509 and siRNA, demonstrated that LSD1 activity was
   essential for proliferation and migration capacities of tumor cells.
   Moreover, reduced proliferation rates after LSD1 inhibition were shown
   to be associated with a cell-cycle arrest of the tumor cells in the
   G2-M-phase. Expression profiling followed by functional classification
   and pathway analysis indicated prominent repression of the polo-like
   kinase 1 (PLK1) pathway upon LSD1 inhibition. In contrast, transient
   overexpression of exogenous PLK1 plasmid rescued the LSD1
   inhibition-mediated downregulation of PLK1 pathway genes.
   Mechanistically, LSD1 directly regulates expression of PLK1 by binding
   to its promoter region that subsequently affects expression of its
   downstream target genes. Notably, using lung adenocarcinoma TCGA
   datasets a significant correlation between LSD1 and PLK1 along with its
   downstream targets was observed. Furthermore, the LSD1/PLK1 linkage was
   confirmed by IHC analysis in a clinical lung adenocarcinoma cohort (n =
   43). Conclusively, this is the first study showing a direct
   transcriptional link between LSD1 and PLK1. IMPLICATIONS: These findings
   point to a role of LSD1 in regulating PLK1 and thus efficient
   G2-M-transition-mediating proliferation of tumor cells and suggest
   targeting the LSD1/PLK1 axis as a novel therapeutic approach for lung
   adenocarcinoma treatment.

AB Sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer
   death worldwide. As a highly heterogeneous complex disease, the
   currently reported classical genetic markers for sCRC, including APC,
   KRAS, BRAF, and TP53 gene mutations and epigenetic alterations, can
   explain only some sCRC patients. Here, we first reported a deleterious
   c.551C>T mutation in SARDH in sCRC. SARDH was identified as a novel
   tumor suppressor gene and was abnormally decreased in sCRC at both the
   transcriptional and the translational level. SARDH mRNA levels were also
   down-regulated in oesophageal cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, and
   pancreatic cancer in the TCGA database. SARDH overexpression inhibited
   the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cell lines, whereas
   its depletion improved these processes. SARDH overexpression was
   down-regulated in multiple pathways, especially in the chemokine
   pathway. The SARDH transcript level was positively correlated with the
   methylation states of CXCL1 and CCL20. Therefore, we concluded that
   SARDH depletion is involved in the development of sCRC.

AB SUMMARY: The quantification of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) abundance using
   a normalization method that calculates transcripts per million (TPM) is
   a key step to compare multiple samples from different experiments.
   TPMCalculator is a one-step software to process RNA-seq alignments in
   BAM format and reports TPM values, raw read counts and feature lengths
   for genes, transcripts, exons and introns. The program describes the
   genomic features through a model generated from the gene transfer format
   file used during alignments reporting of the TPM values and the raw read
   counts for each feature. In this paper, we show the correlation for 1256
   samples from the TCGA-BRCA project between TPM and FPKM reported by
   TPMCalculator and RSeQC. We also show the correlation for raw read
   counts reported by TPMCalculator, HTSeq and featureCounts.
   AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TPMCalculator is freely available at
   https://github.com/ncbi/TPMCalculator. It is implemented in C++14 and
   supported on Mac OS X, Linux and MS Windows.
   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at
   Bioinformatics online.

AB Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a curious bottleneck in cancer research
   and chemotherapy, whereby some cells rapidly adapt to the tumor
   microenvironment via a myriad of heterogeneous metabolic activities.
   Despite being a major impediment to treatment, there is a silver lining:
   control over metabolic regulation could be an effective approach to
   overcome or correct resistance pathways. In this critical review, we
   comprehensively and carefully curated and analyzed large networks of
   previously identified proteins associated with metabolic adaptation in
   MDR. We employed data and text mining to study and categorize more than
   600 studies in PubMed, with particular focus on AMPK, a central and
   fundamental modulator in the energy metabolism network that has been
   specifically implicated in cancer MDR pathways. We have identified one
   protein set of metabolic adaptations with 137 members closely related to
   cancer MDR processes, and a second protein set with 165 members derived
   from AMPK-based networks, with 28 proteins found at the intersection
   between the two sets. Furthermore, according to genomics analysis of the
   cancer genome atlas (TCGA) provisional data, the highest alteration
   frequency (80.0%) of the genes encoding the intersected proteins (28
   proteins), ranked three cancer types with quite remarkable significance
   across 166 studies. The hierarchical relationships of the entire
   identified gene and protein networks indicate broad correlations in
   AMPK-mediated metabolic regulation pathways, which we use decipher and
   depict the metabolic roles of AMPK and demonstrate the potential of
   metabolic control for therapeutic intervention in MDR.

AB Recently, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) hypothesis has gained a
   great interest in the study of molecular biological mechanisms of cancer
   occurrence and progression. However, studies on leukemia are limited,
   and there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA
   ceRNA regulatory network of AML based on high-throughput sequencing and
   large-scale sample size. We obtained RNA-Seq data and compared the
   expression profiles between 407 normal whole blood (GTEx) and 151 bone
   marrows of AML (TCGA). The similarity between two sets of genes with
   trait in the network was analyzed by weighted correlation network
   analysis (WGCNA). MiRcode, starBase, miRTarBase, miRDB and TargetScan
   was used to predict interactions between lncRNAs, miRNAs and target
   mRNAs. At last, we identified 108 lncRNAs, 10 miRNAs and 8 mRNAs to
   construct a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network, which might act as
   prognostic biomarkers of AML. Among the network, a survival model with 8
   target mRNAs (HOXA9+INSR+KRIT1+MYB+SPRY2+UBE2V1+WEE1+ZNF711) was set up
   by univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard regression
   analysis, of which the AUC was 0.831, indicating its sensitivity and
   specificity in AML prognostic prediction. CeRNA networks could provide
   further insight into the study on gene regulation and AML prognosis.

AB Alterations of biological pathways can lead to oncogenesis. An overview
   of these oncogenic pathways would be highly valuable for researchers to
   reveal the pathogenic mechanism and develop novel therapeutic approaches
   for cancers. Here, we reviewed approximately 8500 literatures and
   documented experimentally validated cancer-pathway associations as
   benchmarking data set. This data resource includes 4709 manually curated
   relationships between 1557 paths and 49 cancers with 2427 upstream
   regulators in 7 species. Based on this resource, we first summarized the
   cancer-pathway associations and revealed some commonly deregulated
   pathways across tumor types. Then, we systematically analyzed these
   oncogenic pathways by integrating TCGA pan-cancer data sets. Multi-omics
   analysis showed oncogenic pathways may play different roles across tumor
   types under different omics contexts. We also charted the survival
   relevance landscape of oncogenic pathways in 26 tumor types, identified
   dominant omics features and found survival relevance for oncogenic
   pathways varied in tumor types and omics levels. Moreover, we predicted
   upstream regulators and constructed a hierarchical network model to
   understand the pathogenic mechanism of human cancers underlying
   oncogenic pathway context. Finally, we developed `CPAD' (freely
   available at http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CPAD/), an online resource
   for exploring oncogenic pathways in human cancers, that integrated
   manually curated cancer-pathway associations, TCGA pan-cancer
   multi-omics data sets, drug-target data, drug sensitivity and
   multi-omics data for cancer cell lines. In summary, our study provides a
   comprehensive characterization of oncogenic pathways and also presents a
   valuable resource for investigating the pathogenesis of human cancer.

PY 2019
AB Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary malignant tumor of
   skeletal with poor prognosis in children and adolescents. Accumulating
   evidence indicates that CBX2 is overexpressed in multiple human neoplasm
   and play a critical role in tumorigenesis and progression. However, its
   functional role and upstream regulation mechanism in osteosarcoma remain
   unknown. In the present study, tissue microarray (TMA) analysis was
   performed to determine the association between CBX2 expression and
   clinical prognosis of osteosarcoma patients by immunohistochemistry. We
   also investigated the functional role of CBX2 using small interfering
   RNA (siRNA) in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we confirmed the direct
   binding between CBX2 and let-7a via qPCR, western blot and luciferase
   reporter assay. We found that CBX2 is dramatically upregulated in
   osteosarcoma tissues and high CBX2 expression was correlated with
   metastasis, recurrence, and chemotherapy response, as well as
   unfavorable prognosis in patients with osteosarcoma. Similar results
   were observed in a sarcoma cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   dataset. Further experiments revealed that CBX2 knockdown significantly
   impeded osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion ability in vitro,
   and suppressed the tumor growth in tumor xenografts model.
   Mechanistically, we confirmed that CBX2 is a functional target of miRNA
   let-7a. Overexpression of let-7a inhibits osteosarcoma cell
   proliferation, which was reversed by CBX2 overexpression. Taken
   together, our study demonstrates that let-7a/CBX2 plays a crucial role
   in osteosarcoma progression. CBX2 could serve as a promising prognostic
   biomarker and potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma patients.

AB N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GALNT2), the enzyme that regulates
   the initial step of mucin O-glycosylation, has been reported to play a
   role in influencing the malignancy of various cancers. However, the
   mechanism through which it influences gliomas is still unknown. In the
   current study, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to select
   genes. Data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) of clinical specimens showed that increased
   GALNT2 expression levels were associated with an unfavorable prognosis
   and a higher tumor grade in human gliomas. Then, GALNT2 knockdown and
   overexpression were performed in glioma cell lines and verified by
   quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Functional
   assays demonstrated that GALNT2 was closely related to glioma cell
   proliferation, cycle transition, migration and invasion. Western blot
   analysis and lectin pull-down assays indicated that GALNT2 knockdown
   decreased the level of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR) and the expression of the Tn antigen on EGFR and affected the
   expression levels of p21, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), cyclinD1,
   matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)
   through the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. GALNT2 overexpression had the
   opposite effects. In vivo, the growth of orthotopic glioma xenografts in
   nude mice was distinctly inhibited by the expression of GALNT2 shRNA,
   and the tumors with GALNT2 shRNA exhibited less aggressiveness and
   reduced expression of Ki67 and MMP2. Overall, GALNT2 facilitates the
   malignant characteristics of glioma by influencing the O-glycosylation
   and phosphorylation of EGFR and the subsequent downstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR
   axis. Therefore, GALNT2 may serve as a novel biomarker and a potential
   target for future therapy of glioma.

AB Background Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is one of the most common cancers in
   the digestive tract. Approximately 300000 people on an average die of
   ESCA per year worldwide. The determination of key microRNAs for the
   prognosis of ESCA is of indispensable significance in the clinical
   treatment. Methods The differentially expressed microRNAs were screened
   by analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. By using the
   survival data of the database, we analyzed correlation between patients'
   survival time and miR-550a expression levels. Differential expression
   analysis and gene set enrichment analysis were performed using the
   targeted data. Results It was found that patients with high miR-550a
   expression levels had shorter survival time. Data mining and signal
   pathway enrichment analysis of TCGA database showed that abnormal
   miR-550a expressions affected the recurrence of tumors by the muscle
   system regulation. Conclusions Through the proposed investigation,
   miR-550a is found to be a potential biomarker as well as non-coding
   therapeutic target for esophagus cancer. These results suggest that
   miR-550a may serve as a therapeutic target and predictor for ESCA
   survival.

   study was to present more evidence about the clinical and prognostic
   value of Ecto-5'-nucleotidase in gastric cancer patients, and
   preliminarily explore the biological function of Ecto-5'-nucleotidase in
   gastric cancer cells. In our study, high Ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression
   was observed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines, respectively,
   compared with normal gastric mucosa tissues cells. Meanwhile, TCGA
   database also indicated that Ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression levels were
   notably elevated in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal gastric
   mucosa tissues. Furthermore, high-expression of Ecto-5'-nucleotidase was
   obviously associated with advanced clinical stage, deep tumor invasion,
   lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis in gastric cancer patients.
   The survival analyses of TCGA database and our study consistent
   suggested high Ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression was negatively correlated
   with overall survival time in gastric cancer patients. The univariate
   and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model showed high
   Ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression was an independent poor prognostic
   factor for gastric cancer patients. Moreover, silencing of
   Ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression suppressed cell proliferation, migration
   and invasion in vitro in gastric cancer. In conclusion,
   Ecto-5'-nucleotidase is a credible prognostic biomarker, and serves as a
   potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.

   ratio (HR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.005-2.063, P=0.047].
   Additionally, patients deceased or recurred/progressed had significantly

   mRNA were significantly overexpressed in male (P=0.0193). Compared with
   patients with AJCC stage I, those with AJCC stage II and stage III-IV
   had significantly higher FAM83D mRNA levels (P = 0.0346 and P=0.0045,

AB Discovery of new actionable targets and functional networks in melanoma

   EMT-like transcriptional program and with an invasive melanoma
   phenotype, as shown by analysis of melanoma cell lines at the mRNA and
   protein levels, interrogation of the TCGA melanoma dataset and
   characterization of melanoma lesions by immunohistochemistry. Gene
   silencing or pharmacological inhibition of NFATc2 downregulated
   EMT-related genes and AXL, and suppressed c-Myc, FOXM1, and EZH2.
   Targeting of c-Myc suppressed FOXM1 and EZH2, while targeting of FOXM1
   suppressed EZH2. Inhibition of c-Myc, or FOXM1, or EZH2 downregulated
   EMT-related gene expression, upregulated MITF and suppressed migratory
   and invasive activity of neoplastic cells. Stable silencing of NFATc2
   impaired melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo
   in SCID mice. In NFATc2(+) EZH2(+) melanoma cell lines pharmacological
   co-targeting of NFATc2 and EZH2 exerted strong anti-proliferative and
   proapoptotic activity, irrespective of BRAF or NRAS mutations and of
   BRAF inhibitor resistance. These results provide preclinical evidence
   for a role of NFATc2 in shaping the EMT-like melanoma phenotype and
   reveal a targetable vulnerability associated with NFATc2 and EZH2
   expression in melanoma cells belonging to different mutational subsets.

AB BACKGROUND: Presently, a 50-gene expression model (PAM50) serves as a
   breast cancer (BC) subtype classifier that is insufficient to
   distinguish, within each single PAM50-classified subtype, patient
   subpopulations having different prognosis. There is a pressing need for
   inexpensive and minimally invasive biomarker tests to easily and
   accurately predict individuals' clinical outcomes and response to
   treatments. Although quantitative proteomic approaches have been
   developed to identify/profile proteins secreted (secretome) from various
   cancer cell lines in vitro, missing are the clinicopathological
   relevance and the associated prognostic value of these secretomic
   identifications.
   METHODS: To discover biomarkers to predict individualized prognosis we
   introduce a new multi-omics (secreto-transcriptomics) method that
   identifies, in their oncogenically secreted states, candidate markers of
   BC subtypes whose genes bear patient-specific mRNA expression
   alterations of prognostic significance. First, we used label-free
   quantitative (LFQ) proteomics to identify the proteins showing
   BC-subtypic secretion from a series of BC cell lines representing major
   BC-subtypes. To determine and externally validate the prognostic value
   of these secreted proteins, we developed a secreto-transcriptomic
   approach that discovered a PAM50-subtypic Secretion-Correlated mRNA
   Expression Pattern (SeCEP) wherein the PAM50-subtypic secretion of
   select proteins statistically correlated with cis-mRNA expression of
   their encoding genes in patients of the corresponding PAM50-subtypes.
   Kaplan-Meier analysis of SeCEP genes was used to identify new liquid
   biopsy biomarkers for predicting individualized prognosis.
   RESULTS: The mRNA expression-to-secretion correlation (SeCEP) pinpointed
   multiple genes that are fully translated into the oncogenically active
   secretome in a PAM50-subtypic manner. Further, multiple SeCEP genes in
   distinct combinations or panels of multiple SeCEP genes were identified
   as 'systems prognostic markers' that showed mRNA co-overexpression
   patterns in the distinct subpopulations of PAM50-subtypic patients with
   poor prognosis or high-risk of relapse. Thus, our secreto-transcriptomic
   approach statistically linked BC subtypic secretome genes with
   patient-specific information about their mRNA expression alterations and
   significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity in patient
   stratification in the context of clinical outcomes or prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: By combining LFQ secretome screening with
   proteo-transcriptomic retrospective analysis of patient data our
   integrated multi-omics approach bypasses costly, tedious, genome-wide
   fishing and predictive modeling that are commonly required to
   distinguish a few prognostically altered genes from thousands of other
   non-BC related genes in a genome.

   effectively predicting the survival of patients with gastric cancer. We
   used high-throughput miRNA data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database for this study. The discriminative capabilities and predictive
   accuracy of the nomogram depended on the calibration curve and
   concordance index (C-index), and comparisons were made between the
   nomogram and current gastric cancer staging systems. Data of 87 patients
   collected from TCGA as bootstrap resamples were used to validate the
   results. In total, 129 miRNAs were differential expressed, of which,
   prognostic function was associated with five miRNAs using Kaplan-Meier
   analysis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of
   these miRNAs were involved in various cancer-related pathways. Age,
   metastasis, lymph node status, T stage and the five-miRNA signature were
   selected as independent survival variables, in the nomogram for primary
   cohort multivariate analysis. According to the survival probability
   calibration curve, the nomogram predictions were consistent with the
   actual observations. The survival predicting nomogram showed a C-index
   of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.78), which was significantly higher than the
   C-index of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition
   (0.60; P < 0.001). We suggest that the proposed nomogram could be used
   to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.

AB Estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (BC), the most abundant BC
   subtype, is notorious for poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
   (NAC). The androgen receptor (AR) was reported to support
   estradiol-mediated ER activity in an in vitro system. Recently,
   ER-positive BC with fewer tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was
   shown to have a better prognosis, opposite to the trend seen with
   ER-negative BC. We hypothesized that ER-positive BC with high expression
   of AR will have fewer TILs and an inferior response to NAC, but with a
   better prognosis. In both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts, AR expression was
   significantly higher in ER-positive BCs compared to ER-negatives (p <
   0.001, p < 0.001, respectively) and it correlated with ER expression (R
   = 0.630, R = 0.509, respectively). In ER-positive tumors, AR high tumors
   enriched UV response down (NES = 2.01, p < 0.001), and AR low tumors
   enriched DNA repair (NES = -2.02, p < 0.001). AR high tumors were
   significantly associated with procancer regulatory T-cells, and AR low
   tumors were associated with anticancer immune cells, such as CD4, CD8,
   and Gamma-Delta T-cells and memory B-cells in ER-positive BC (p < 0.01).
   Further, cytolytic activity was significantly lower in AR high BC in
   both cohorts. Finally, AR high tumors had a significantly lower rate of
   attaining pathological complete response to NAC (GSE22358), but better
   survival. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that high AR has fewer
   tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as well as cytolytic activity and an
   inferior response to NAC, but better survival in ER-positive BC.

TI DNA methylation of CRB3 is a prognostic biomarker in clear cell renal

AB Our previous study revealed that CRB3 protein expression was reduced in
   clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and was associated with TNM
   stage, pathological grade, and poor prognosis of ccRCC. This study aimed
   to investigate if DNA methylation of CRB3 decreases its expression,
   subsequently leading to the progression and poor prognosis of ccRCC.
   Data for DNA methylation of CRB3, CRB3 mRNA expression, and ccRCC
   clinicopathological parameters were extracted from the cancer genome
   atlas (TCGA) database. The relationships among DNA methylation of CRB3,
   CRB3 mRNA expression, and ccRCC clinicopathological parameters were
   analyzed using UALCAN, MethHC, LinkedOmics, and Wanderer. We found that
   CRB3 mRNA levels were lower in ccRCC compared to normal tissues.
   Methylation of CRB3 increased in ccRCC, with all probes showing
   differences between ccRCC and normal tissues. Furthermore, CRB3 DNA
   methylation negatively correlated with CRB3 mRNA expression. CRB3 DNA
   methylation was also related to pathologic stage, T stage, N stage, and
   M stage of ccRCC. Overall survival was shorter in ccRCC patients with
   high CRB3 DNA methylation compared to ccRCC patients with low CRB3 DNA
   methylation. Methylation of cg24798010, a CRB3 probe, was related to
   laterality, pathologic stage, T stage, M stage,
   neoplasm-histologic-grade without N stage, and race. Furthermore,
   treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor Decitabine resulted in the
   upregulation of CRB3 mRNA in ccRCC cell lines. These results indicate
   that DNA methylation of CRB3 may be both a prognostic marker and
   therapeutic target for ccRCC.

AB BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the role of the long
   noncoding RNA (lncRNA), LINC01555, on the migration and invasion of
   colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, its expression in CRC tissue, and its
   interaction with the neuropeptide, neuromedin U (NmU). MATERIAL AND
   METHODS LINC01555 expression in SW620 and HCT116 CRC cells, and NCM460
   normal colorectal cells, and 48 resection specimens containing CRC and
   adjacent normal tissue, was detected by quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cox regression analysis was used to
   assess the relationship between LINC01555 expression and patient
   survival. The effects of LINC01555 expression on CRC cell proliferation,
   migration, and invasion were assessed using the cell counting kit-8
   (CCK-8) assay, the colony formation assay, and the transwell assay.
   Functional studies determined the interaction between LINC01555 and NmU
   in the development of CRC. RESULTS The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   dataset showed that LINC01555 was highly expressed in CRC tissue when
   compared with adjacent normal colorectal tissue. LINC01555 expression
   was positively correlated with tumor stage, but negatively correlated
   with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and was an
   independent risk factor for CRC. The receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curve analysis showed the diagnostic specificity of LINC01555 in
   CRC. Knockdown of LINC01555 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and
   invasion of CRC cells. Functional studies showed that knockdown of NmU
   reduced cell migration and invasion of CRC cells that overexpressed
   LINC01555. CONCLUSIONS Increased expression of LINC01555 was found in
   CRC tissues and promoted the invasion of CRC cells by upregulating the
   expression of NmU.

AB Runx2 is a transcription factor involved in melanoma cell migration and
   proliferation. Here, we extended the analysis of Runt domain of Runx2 in
   melanoma cells to deepen understanding of the underlying mechanisms. By
   the CRISPR/Cas9 system we generated the Runt KO melanoma cells 3G8.
   Interestingly, the proteome analysis showed a specific protein signature
   of 3G8 cells related to apoptosis and migration, and pointed out the
   involvement of Runt domain in the neoangiogenesis process. Among the
   proteins implicated in angiogenesis we identified fatty acid synthase,
   chloride intracellular channel protein-4, heat shock protein beta-1, Rho
   guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1, D-3-phosphog lycerate
   dehydrogenase, myosin-1c and caveolin-1. Upon querying the TCGA
   provisional database for melanoma, the genes related to these proteins
   were found altered in 51.36% of total patients. In addition, VEGF gene
   expression was reduced in 3G8 as compared to A375 cells; and HUVEC
   co-cultured with 3G8 cells expressed lower levels of CD105 and CD31
   neoangiogenetic markers. Furthermore, the tube formation assay revealed
   down-regulation of capillary-like structures in HUVEC co-cultured with
   3G8 in comparison to those with A375 cells. These findings provide new
   insight into Runx2 molecular details which can be crucial to possibly
   propose it as an oncotarget of melanoma.

AB In endometrial carcinoma, the clinical outcome directly correlates with
   the TNM stage, but the lack of sufficient information prevents accurate
   prediction. The molecular mechanism underlying the competing endogenous
   RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis has not been investigated in endometrial cancer.
   Multi-bioinformatic analyses, including differentially expressed gene
   analysis, ceRNA network construction, Cox regression analysis, function
   enrichment analysis, and protein-protein network analysis, were
   performed on the sequence data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) data bank. A ceRNA network comprising 366 mRNAs, 27 microRNAs
   (miRNAs), and 66 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was established.
   Survival analysis performed with the univariate Cox regression analysis
   revealed nine lncRNAs with prognostic power in endometrial carcinoma. In
   multivariate Cox regression analysis, a signature comprising LINC00491,
   LINC00483, ADARB2-AS1, and C8orf49 showed remarkable prognostic power.
   Risk score and neoplasm status, but not TNM stage, were independent
   prognostic factors of endometrial carcinoma. A ceRNA network comprising
   differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs may reveal the
   molecular events involved in the progression of endometrial carcinoma.
   In addition, the signature with prognostic value may discriminate
   patients with increased risk for poor outcome, which may allow
   physicians to take accurate decisions.

PY 2019
AB BACKGROUND: Transgelin-2 is an actin-binding protein that is widely
   expressed in various tissues and organs of the body, and reportedly may
   participate in the development and progression of multiple cancers.
   However, the clinical significance of transgelin-2 still remains
   controversial. We, therefore, aimed to determine the expression of
   transgelin-2 in breast cancer as well as its correlation with the
   tumorigenesis, progression and prognosis of human breast cancer.
   METHODS: We collected tissues of 58 breast cancer patients from our
   hospital and 1090 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
   X-tile software was used to divide the transgelin-2 mRNA expression
   level in the database, logistic regression model was used to identify
   independent factors influencing transgelin-2 mRNA expression, and then
   Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to find factors that
   influence survival of breast cancer.
   RESULTS: Transgelin-2 was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer
   tissues from our hospital and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curve indicated that transgelin-2 may have diagnostic value. Meanwhile,
   estrogen receptor (ER) was in inverse correlation with transgelin-2
   protein and mRNA expression, and transgelin-2 expression was positively
   correlated with Ki67 in breast cancer tissues. Logistic regression model
   revealed that TNM stage, ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status were
   independent factors for transgelin-2 mRNA expression. Patients with high
   transgelin-2 mRNA expression showed a poor survival and the trend was
   statistically significant only in ER-negative patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transgelin-2 was expressed significantly higher in breast
   cancer cells and correlated with some clinicopathological factors. High
   transgelin-2 expression might predict poor prognosis for ER-negative
   patients.

PD 2019-May-29
PY 2019
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of
   cancer-associated death globally. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have
   been identified as micro RNA (miRNA) sponges in a competing endogenous
   RNA (ceRNA) network and are involved in the regulation of mRNA
   expression. This study aims to construct a lncRNA-associated ceRNA
   network and investigate the prognostic biomarkers in CRC. A total of 38
   differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, 23 DEmiRNAs and 27 DEmRNAs were
   identified by analysing the expression profiles of CRC obtained from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These RNAs were chosen to develop a ceRNA
   regulatory network of CRC, which comprised 125 edges. Survival analysis
   showed that four lncRNAs, six miRNAs and five mRNAs were significantly
   associated with overall survival. A potential regulatory axis of
   ADAMTS9-AS2/miR-32/PHLPP2 was identified from the network. Experimental
   validation was performed using clinical samples by quantitative
   real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which showed that expression of the genes in
   the axis was associated with clinicopathological features and the
   correlation among them perfectly conformed to the 'ceRNA theory'.
   Overexpression of ADAMTS9-AS2 in colon cancer cell lines significantly
   inhibited the miR-32 expression and promoted PHLPP2 expression, while
   ADAMTS9-AS2 knockdown had the opposite effects. The constructed novel
   ceRNA network may provide a comprehensive understanding of the
   mechanisms of CRC carcinogenesis. The ADAMTS9-AS2/miR-32/PHLPP2
   regulatory axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

AB BACKGROUND: The selection of reference genes is essential for
   quantifying gene expression. Theoretically they should be expressed
   stably and not regulated by experimental or pathological conditions.
   However, identification and validation of reference genes for human
   cancer research are still being regarded as a critical point, because
   cancerous tissues often represent genetic instability and heterogeneity.
   Recent pan-cancer studies have demonstrated the importance of the
   appropriate selection of reference genes for use as internal controls
   for the normalization of gene expression; however, no stably expressed,
   consensus reference genes valid for a range of different human cancers
   have yet been identified.
   RESULTS: In the present study, we used large-scale cancer gene
   expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, which
   contains 10,028 (9,364 cancerous and 664 normal) samples from 32
   different cancer types, to confirm that the expression of the most
   commonly used reference genes is not consistent across a range of cancer
   types. Furthermore, we identified 38 novel candidate reference genes for
   the normalization of gene expression, independent of cancer type. These
   genes were found to be highly expressed and highly connected to relevant
   gene networks, and to be enriched in transcription-translation
   regulation processes. The expression stability of the newly identified
   reference genes across 29 cancerous and matched normal tissues were
   validated via quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR).
   CONCLUSIONS: We reveal that most commonly used reference genes in
   current cancer studies cannot be appropriate to serve as representative
   control genes for quantifying cancer-related gene expression levels, and
   propose in this study three potential reference genes (HNRNPL, PCBP1,
   and RER1) to be the most stably expressed across various cancerous and
   normal human tissues.

AB CD204 is a specific marker of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in
   glioma. However, the expression levels of CD204 and its involvement in
   glioma are not fully understood. In this large-scale study, we assessed
   the expression and function of CD204 in whole-grade glioma molecularly
   and clinically. In total, 1323 glioma samples, including 301 microarray
   data and 325 RNA-seq data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA)
   dataset and 697 RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   dataset, were utilized. The statistical analysis and graphical work were
   mainly performed using the R software. Univariate and multivariate Cox
   analysis demonstrated that CD204 was an independent prognosticator in
   glioma patients. CD204 expression was positively correlated with the
   grade of malignancy. CD204 was consistently upregulated in wild-type
   isocitrate dehydrogenase glioma and highly expressed in mesenchymal
   glioblastoma. Gene ontology of CD204-related genes showed that CD204 was
   most enriched in inflammatory response and immune response. It was
   associated with the stromal and immune populations, especially the
   monocytic lineage, fibroblasts, and T cells. Circos plots revealed that
   CD204 was closely associated with many immune checkpoint regulators,
   especially TIM-3. CD204 expression is consistent with the malignant
   phenotype of glioma and independently predicts poor outcomes in glioma
   patients. Additionally, CD204+ TAMs, collaborating with other checkpoint
   members, may contribute to the dysfunction of T cells. These findings
   suggest that CD204 may be a promising target for glioma immunotherapy.

AB Transcription Factor 19 (TCF19) harbors a forkhead association (FHA)
   domain, a proline-rich region, a PHD or RING finger region, suggesting
   that TCF19 possesses powerful function. However, its expression and
   function remains unknown in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
   function cluster analysis was carried out using Metascape website. MTT,
   colony formation and anchorage-independent growth ability assay were
   carried out to detect the effect of TCF19 on cell proliferation.
   Bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) labeling and flow cytometry assay were used to
   evaluate the effect of TCF19 on cell cycle progression. qPCR and
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were performed to investigate
   the mechanism by which TCF19 is involved in cell cycle transition.
   Through analyzing the public available dataset The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA), we found that TCF19 is significantly increased in the LAC and
   SCC, two primary histological subtype of NSCLC. Besides, further
   function cluster analysis exhibited that TCF19 may mainly participate in
   cell cycle. MTT, colony formation and anchorage-independent growth
   ability assay confirmed that overexpression of TCF19 enhances the
   proliferation of both LAC and SCC cells. Besides, further experiments
   revealed that TCF19 contributes to cell cycle G1/S transition. Not only
   that, upregulation of TCF19 can inhibit the expression of p21, p27 and
   p57, while promote the expression of Cyclin D1 through inhibiting FOXO1.
   Our research offers important evidence that TCF19 can promote cell cycle
   progression of NSCLC cells, and TCF19 may be served as a novel
   therapeutic targets. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB There is growing evidence that alternative splicing (AS) plays an
   important role in cancer development. However, a comprehensive analysis
   of AS signatures in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is lacking
   and urgently needed. It remains unclear whether AS acts as diagnostic
   biomarkers in predicting the prognosis of KIRC patients. In the work,
   gene expression and clinical data of KIRC were obtained from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA), and profiles of AS events were downloaded from the
   SpliceSeq database. The RNA sequence/AS data and clinical information
   were integrated, and we conducted the Cox regression analysis to screen
   survival-related AS events and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Correlation
   between prognostic AS events and gene expression were analyzed using the
   Pearson correlation coefficient. Protein-protein interaction analysis
   was conducted for the prognostic AS-related genes, and a potential
   regulatory network was built using Cytoscape (version 3.6.1). Meanwhile,
   functional enrichment analysis was conducted. A prognostic risk score
   model is then established based on seven hub genes (KRT222, LENG8, APOB,
   SLC3A1, SCD5, AQP1, and ADRA1A) that have high performance in the risk
   classification of KIRC patients. A total 46,415 AS events including
   10,601 genes in 537 patients with KIRC were identified. In univariate
   Cox regression analysis, 13,362 survival associated AS events and 8,694
   survival-specific mRNAs were detected. Common 3,105 genes were screen by
   overlapping 13,362 survival associated AS events and 8,694
   survival-specific mRNAs. The Pearson correlation analysis suggested that
   13 genes were significantly correlated with AS events (Pearson
   correlation coefficient >0.8 or <-0.8). Then, We conducted multivariate
   Cox regression analyses to select the potential prognostic AS genes.
   Seven genes were identified to be significantly related to OS. A
   prognostic model based on seven genes was constructed. The area under
   the ROC curve was 0.767. In the current study, a robust prognostic
   prediction model was constructed for KIRC patients, and the findings
   revealed that the AS events could act as potential prognostic biomarkers
   for KIRC.

AB BackgroundThis study aimed to establish an artificial neural network
   (ANN) model based on variant pathways to predict the risk of thyroid
   cancer.MethodsThe RNASeq data of 482 thyroid cancer samples were
   downloaded from the TCGA database. The samples were divided into
   low-risk and high-risk groups, followed by identification of
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Co-expression analysis and
   pathway enrichment analysis were then performed. The variant pathways
   were screened according to the functional deviation score of each
   pathway, and an ANN model was established. Finally, the efficiency of
   the ANN model for risk assessment was validated by survival analysis and
   analysis of an independent microarray dataset (GSE34289) for thyroid
   cancer.ResultsIn total, 190 DEGs (85 up-regulated and 105
   down-regulated) were identified between the low-risk and high-risk
   groups. Ten risk-related variant pathways were identified between the
   low-risk and high-risk groups, which were related to inflammatory and
   immune responses. Based on these variant pathways, an ANN model was
   built, consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output
   layer, corresponding to 15, 8, 5, and 1 neuron, respectively. Survival
   analysis showed that this model could effectively distinguish the
   samples with different risks. Analysis of microarray dataset GSE34289
   showed that the accuracy of this model for predicating low-risk and
   high-risk samples was 77.5 and 86.0%, respectively.ConclusionsThis study
   suggests that the ANN model based on variant pathways can be used for
   effectively evaluating the risk of thyroid cancer.

AB Objective: To investigate the expression and prognosis effect of
   methylation-regulated SLIT3 and SPRCL1 genes in smoking-related lung
   adenocarcinoma. Methods: The expression levels of SLIT3 and SPARCL1 in
   cigarette smoke-induced malignant transformed cell (S30) and lung
   adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines were measured by real-time fluorescence
   quantitative PCR (qPCR). Datasets of mRNA expression, DNA methylation
   and patient information data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Altas
   (TCGA) database. The mRNA expression levels of SLIT3 and SPARCL1 were
   validated in LUAD tissues. The 10-year survival curve of LUAD patients
   with different smoking history was plotted, and the correlation between
   mRNA expression level and DNA methylation level of LUAD patients was
   further analyzed. S30 cells were treated with 5-azacytidine (5-aza), an
   inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, to analyze the methylation
   regulatory mechanism of SLIT3 and SPRCL1. Results: The qPCR results
   showed the significant down-regulation of SLIT3 and SPARCL1 in S30 cell
   and four LUAD cell lines (SLIT3: 0.493±0.134 and 0.041±0.014,
   0.161±0.023, 0.277±0.055, 0.035±0.005; SPARCL1: 0.507±0.131 and
   0.453±0.045, 0.420±0.040, 0.153±0.035, 0.430±0.050; all P<0.01).
   Bioinformatics analysis showed that SLIT3 and SPARCL1 were low expressed
   in LUAD tissue (8.12±1.58 vs 10.84±0.69 and 11.46±1.06 vs 13.57±0.67;
   both P<0.001) compared with adjacent peritumoral tissues, and expression
   levels of SLIT3 and SPARCL1 were significantly correlated with smoking
   history (both P<0.001). Non-smoker with high expression of SLIT3 and
   SPARCL1 was associated with better prognosis among LUAD patients. There
   was a significant negative correlation between promoter methylation and
   mRNA expression level of the two genes (r=-0.208, -0.574; both P<0.001).
   5-aza treatment significantly up-regulated the expression levels of
   SLIT3 and SPARCL1 genes in S30 cells (2.137±0.281, 3.657±0.882; both
   P<0.01). Conclusion: SLIT3 and SPARCL1 can be regulated by DNA
   methylation and down-regulated in LUAD tissue, which has important
   prognostic significance on the smoking-induced LUAD patients.

AB FAM64A was found to be markedly up-regulated in tumor samples and
   associated with worse overall survival in multiple cancer types,
   including breast cancer. However, the functional significance of FAM64A
   in breast cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we
   systematically investigated the expression of FAM64A in multiple public
   breast cancer datasets. We found that FAM64A is significantly positively
   correlated with tumor stemness index in breast cancer samples,
   corresponding with an advanced clinical grade, metastasis and
   unfavorable prognosis. In vitro experiments further showed an
   up-regulation of sternness genes after over-expressing FAM64A in breast
   cancer cells. FAM64A overexpression also promoted breast cancer cell
   proliferation, migration, accompanied by the activation of
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides, we identified a
   strong association of FAM64A expression with TP53 mutations in TCGA and
   three additional breast cancer datasets. In summary, our study revealed
   a novel function of FAM64A in promoting breast cancer stemness and EMT,
   suggesting that targeting of FAM64A may have therapeutic values in
   advanced breast cancer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ALPL gene is linked to hypophosphatasia, a rare genetic disease.
   Owing to the inverse relationships between ALPL expression and both the
   International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages and
   histological grades assigned to patients with serous ovarian cancer
   (SOC), this study was designed to explore the role and possible
   mechanisms of ALPL in cell motility of high grade SOC (HGSOC). The
   effects of ALPL overexpression on migration and invasion were detected
   in HGSOC cell lines SKOV3 and HEY. Gene ontology analysis for
   differential genes with ALPL overexpression identified several
   biological processes, including EMT, correlated with cell motility.
   Genes potentially implicated in EMT and associated with ALPL were
   screened using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The WNT receptor
   Frizzled2 (FZD2) was identified and its role in HGSOC cell motility and
   survival was investigated. It was found that forced expression of ALPL
   could inhibit migration, invasion, and EMT in HGSOC cells. It also
   reduced the expression of FZD2 and its ligand WNT5A, accompanied by
   suppressed expression of their downstream target phosphorylated-STAT3
   (pSTAT3). These effects were initiated via the FZD2 knockdown using
   siRNA and reversed by recombinant WNT5A protein. The relationship
   between FZD2 expression and poor HGSOC patient survival was also
   investigated. This data supports that ALPL might restrict the function
   of WNT5A-FZD2-STAT3 axis, a non-canonical WNT pathway for promoting EMT
   progression, which results in attenuated migration and invasion in HGSOC
   cells and improves survival in patients with SOC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Measures of the adaptive immune response have prognostic and
   predictive associations in melanoma and other cancer types.
   Specifically, intratumoral T cell density and function have considerable
   prognostic and predictive value in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). Less
   is known about the significance of tumor-infiltrating B cells in SKCM.
   Our goal was to understand the prognostic and predictive value of B cell
   phenotypic subsets in SKCM using RNA sequencing.
   METHODS: We used our previously published algorithm, V'DJer, to assemble
   B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires and estimate diversity from short-read
   RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We applied machine learning-based cellular
   phenotype classifiers to measure relative similarity of bulk tumor
   sample gene expression profiles and different B cell phenotypes. We
   assessed these aspects of B cell biology in 473 SKCM from the Cancer
   Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) as well as in RNA-seq data corresponding to
   tumor samples procured from patients who received CTLA-4 and PD-1
   inhibitors for metastatic SKCM.
   RESULTS: We found that the BCR repertoire was associated with different
   clinical factors, such as tumor tissue site and sex. However, increased
   clonality of the BCR repertoire was favorably prognostic in SKCM and was
   prognostic even after first conditioning on various clinical factors.
   Mutation burden was not correlated with any BCR measurement, and no
   specific mutation had an altered BCR repertoire. Lack of an assembled
   BCR in pre-treatment tumor tissues was associated with a lack of
   anti-tumor response to a CTLA-4 inhibitor in metastatic SKCM.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important prognostic and
   predictive role for B cell characteristics in SKCM. This has
   implications for melanoma immunobiology and potential development of
   immunogenomics features to predict survival and response to
   immunotherapy.

AB BACKGROUND: The tumor immune microenvironment has become the focus of
   research in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) due to its important
   role in immune surveillance post nephrectomy. This study investigates
   the correlation of tumor infiltrating immune cell characteristics with
   rates of recurrence following surgery in localized ccRCC.
   METHODS: We morphologically identified and scored tumor infiltrating
   lymphocytes (TILs) in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides of
   patients with localized ccRCC (stage ≥T1b excluding stage IV). The
   University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) dataset (n=159) was used to
   discover and the Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) dataset (n=198) was used
   to validate the results of morphologic immune cell analysis. We then
   performed gene expression analysis using the Immune Profile panel by
   NanoString in the UAB cohort and identified immune cells and pathways
   associated with recurrence, followed by validation in the Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC dataset. Infiltrating immune cell types were
   identified by gene expression deconvolution.
   RESULTS: The presence of TILs identified by morphology correlated with
   higher T cell, Th1, CD8+ T and Treg gene signatures. Recurrence was
   associated with lower T cells and higher neutrophils. Higher Teffector
   (Teff)/Treg ratio correlated with lower rate of recurrence and was
   validated in the TCGA dataset. Genes associated with adaptive immune
   response were downregulated in tumors that recurred. Unsupervised
   hierarchical clustering identified a subset of patients with
   over-expression of adaptive response genes including CD8, CD3, GZMA/B,
   PRF1, IDO1, CTLA4, PDL1, ICOS and TIGIT. These patients had higher
   morphologic lymphocyte infiltration and T cell gene expression. Higher
   levels of TILs identified by morphology correlated with higher rates of
   recurrence in our discovery dataset but not in our validation set.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of ccRCC following surgery was associated with
   lower T cell infiltrate, lower adaptive immune response and higher
   neutrophil gene expression. Presence of higher Teff/Treg ratio
   correlated with lower recurrence.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas have a high degree of malignancy, high
   recurrence rate, high mortality rate, and low cure rate. Searching for
   new markers of glioblastomas is of great significance for improving the
   diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of glioma.
   METHODS: Using the GEO public database, we combined 34 glioma microarray
   datasets containing 1893 glioma samples and conducted genetic data
   mining through statistical analysis, bioclustering, and pathway
   analysis. The results were validated in TCGA, CGGA, and internal
   cohorts. We further selected a gene for subsequent experiments and
   conducted cell proliferation and cell cycle analyses to verify the
   biological function of this gene.
   RESULTS: Eight glioblastoma-specific differentially expressed genes were
   screened using GEO. In the TCGA and CGGA cohorts, patients with high
   CBX3, BARD1, EGFR, or IFRD1 expression had significantly shorter
   survival but patients with high GUCY1A3 or MOBP expression had
   significantly longer survival than patients with lower expression of
   these genes. After reviewing the literature, we selected the CBX3 gene
   for further experiments. We confirmed that CBX3 was overexpressed in
   glioblastoma by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays and
   qPCR analysis of surgical specimens. The functional assay results showed
   that silencing CBX3 arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, thereby
   weakening the cell proliferation ability.
   CONCLUSIONS: We used a multidisciplinary approach to analyze
   glioblastoma samples in 34 microarray datasets, revealing novel
   diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in patients with glioblastoma and
   providing a new direction for screening tumor markers.

AB Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an unusually low 5-year
   survival rate linked to higher metastatic rates. Our laboratory recently
   delineated a role for the alternative RNA splicing (AS) of cytoplasmic
   polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2), via
   inclusion/exclusion of exon 4, in the metastasis of TNBC. In these
   studies, the mechanism governing the inclusion/exclusion of exon 4 was
   examined. Specifically, the RNA trans-factor, SRSF3, was found to be
   explicitly associated with CPEB2 exon 4. A SRSF3 consensus sequence was
   identified in exon 4, and mutation of this sequence abolished the
   association of SRSF3. The expression of SRSF3 was upregulated in TNBC
   cells upon the acquisition of anoikis resistance correlating with a
   reduction in the CPEB2A/B ratio. Importantly, downregulation of SRSF3 in
   these cells by siRNA induced the exclusion of exon 4 in cells increasing
   the ratio of CPEB2A (exon 4 excluded) to CPEB2B (exon 4 included).
   Downregulation of SRSF3 also reversed the CPEB2A/B ratio of a wild-type
   CPEB2 exon 4 minigene and endogenous CPEB2 pre-mRNA, but not a mutant
   CPEB2 minigene with the SRSF3 RNA cis-element ablated. SRSF3
   downregulation ablated the anoikis resistance of TNBC cells, which was
   "rescued" by ectopic expression of CPEB2B. Finally, analysis of The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed a positive relationship
   between SRSF3 expression and lower CPEB2A/B ratios in aggressive breast
   cancers. Implications: These findings demonstrate that SRSF3 modulates
   CPEB2 AS to induce the expression of the CPEB2B isoform that drives TNBC
   phenotypes correlating with aggressive human breast cancer.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) exhibits epidemiological and molecular
   heterogeneity. Despite extensive studies of its phenotypic and genetic
   properties in Western populations, its molecular basis is not clear in
   Chinese patients. To determine critical molecular characteristics and
   explore correlations between genomic markers and clinical parameters in
   Chinese populations, we applied an integrative genetic/transcriptomic
   assay that combines targeted next-generation sequencing and quantitative
   real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from 46 Chinese patients with PCa.
   Lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D), zinc finger homeobox 3
   (ZFHX3), A-kinase anchoring protein 9 (AKAP9), and GLI family zinc
   finger 1 (GLI1) were frequently mutated in our cohort. Moreover, a
   clinicopathological analysis showed that RB transcriptional corepressor
   1 (RB1) deletion was common in patients with a high risk of disease
   progression. Remarkably, four genomic events, MYC proto-oncogene (MYC)
   amplification, RB1 deletion, APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway
   (APC) mutation or deletion, and cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12)
   mutation, were correlated with poor disease-free survival. In addition,
   a close link between KMT2D expression and the androgen receptor (AR)
   signaling pathway was observed both in our cohort and in The Cancer
   Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) data. In summary, our
   results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of integrative
   molecular characterization of PCa samples in disease pathology research
   and personalized medicine.

AB Genomic sequencing projects unraveled the mutational landscape of head
   and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and provided a comprehensive
   catalogue of somatic mutations. However, the limited number of
   significant cancer-related genes obtained so far only partially explains
   the biological complexity of HNSCC and hampers the development of novel
   diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We pursued a multi-scale
   omics approach based on whole-exome sequencing, global DNA methylation
   and gene expression profiling data derived from tumor samples of the
   HIPO-HNC cohort (n=87), and confirmed new findings with datasets from
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Promoter methylation was confirmed by
   MassARRAY analysis and protein expression was assessed by
   immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. We discovered a
   set of cancer-related genes with frequent somatic mutations and high
   frequency of promoter methylation. This included the ryanodine receptor
   2 (RYR2), which showed variable promoter methylation and expression in
   both tumor samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of
   tissue sections unraveled a gradual loss of RYR2 expression from normal
   mucosa via dysplastic lesion to invasive cancer, and indicated that
   reduced RYR2 expression in adjacent tissue and precancerous lesions
   might serve as risk factor for unfavorable prognosis and upcoming
   malignant conversion. In summary, our data indicate that impaired RYR2
   function by either somatic mutation or epigenetic silencing is a common
   event in HNSCC pathogenesis. Detection of RYR2 expression and/or
   promoter methylation might enable risk assessment for malignant
   conversion of dysplastic lesions. This article is protected by

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant cancer of digestive system,
   identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for GC is
   urgently demanded. The aim of this study was to determine potential long
   noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with the pathogenesis and prognosis
   of GC. Raw noncoding RNA microarray data (GSE53137, GSE70880, and
   GSE99417) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.
   Differentially expressed genes between GC and adjacent normal gastric
   tissue samples were screened by an integrated analysis of multiple gene
   expression profile after gene reannotation and batch normalization.
   Differentially expressed genes were further confirmed by The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network,
   Gene Ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway,
   survival analysis were extensively applied to identify hub lncRNAs and
   discover potential biomarkers related to diagnosis and prognosis of GC.
   In total of 246 integrated differential genes including 15 lncRNAs and
   241 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were obtained after intersections of
   differential genes between GEO and TCGA database. ceRNA network
   comprised of three lncRNAs (UCA1, HOTTIP, and HMGA1P4), 26 microRNAs
   (miRNAs) and 72 mRNAs. Functional analysis revealed that three lncRNAs
   were mainly dominated in cell cycle and cellular senescence. Survival
   analysis showed that HMGA1P4 was statistically related to the overall
   survival rate. For the first time, we identified that HMGA1P4, a target
   of miR-301b/miR-508, is involved in cell cycle and senescence process by
   regulating CCNA2 in GC. Finally, the expression levels of three lncRNAs
   were validated to be upregulated in GC tissues. Thus, three lncRNAs
   including UCA1, HOTTIP, and HMGA1P4 may contribute to GC development and
   their potential functions might be associated with the prognosis of GC.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aims to explore the associations between
   N-alpha-acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p) and p53-induced protein
   with a RING-H2 domain (Pirh2) expression, and clinicopathological
   characteristics in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
   METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect Naa10p and Pirh2
   levels containing 118 OSCC specimens, and additional analyses were used
   to determine correlations between Naa10p and Pirh2 expressions, generate
   survival curves and perform univariate and multivariate statistical
   analyses. Further, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot
   were employed to examine Naa10p and Pirh2 expression level in OSCC
   patients' samples. We further validated the result using RNAseq data
   from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and mRNA array data from GSE31056
   and GSE30784.
   RESULTS: Naa10p and Pirh2 are overexpression, and the protein level of
   Naa10p was negatively correlated with that of Pirh2 in OSCC tissues.
   Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that
   positive Naa10p expression and negative Pirh2 expression were both
   independent good prognostic factors for OSCC patients. Furthermore, the
   Naa10p-positive/Pirh2-negative group has the best prognosis among all
   OSCC patients. Results from qRT-PCR showed the higher expression level
   of Naa10 and lower expression level of Pirh2 in tumor tissues than
   adjacent normal tissues. TCGA database and data from GSE31056 and
   GSE30784 showed the similar result. The correlation analysis showed that
   the mRNA level of Naa10 was negatively correlated that of Pirh2.
   CONCLUSION: The expression of Naa10p is negatively correlated with that
   of Pirh2, and positive Naa10p and negative Pirh2 might be independent
   biomarkers for better OSCC prognoses. This article is protected by

AB As an important regulator of epigenetics, histone lysine
   methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C), is frequently mutated in multiple human
   cancers and is considered to be crucial for the occurrence and
   development of numerous cancers. However, the relationship between KMT2C
   mutation and clinicopathological characteristics in patients with breast
   cancer is unclear. In the present study, we performed next-generation
   sequencing to investigate the mutation status of KMT2C in 411
   treatment-naive Chinese patients with breast cancer at Guangdong
   Provincial People's Hospital (GDPH), and further compared the results to
   those of patients with breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA,
   n = 981) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International
   Consortium (METABRIC, n = 1454) cohorts. The KMT2C mutation rate was
   8.0% (33/411) in the GDPH cohort, whereas that in the TCGA and the
   METABRIC cohorts was 7.0% (69/981) and 14.5% (211/1454), respectively.
   Nineteen novel mutations were observed in the GDPH cohort. KMT2C
   mutations were found to be significantly associated with patients older
   than 50 years (GDPH: p = 0.007; TCGA: p = 0.005; METABRIC: p = 0.015).
   The KMT2C mutation rate in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients was higher
   than that in the other subtypes (GDPH: p = 0.047; TCGA: p = 0.032;
   METABRIC: p = 0.046). In addition, KMT2C mutations in the GDPH cohort
   were observed in invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) at 30.8% (4/13).
   Further, KMT2C mutation was not found to be an independent risk factor
   in the prognosis of patients with breast cancer [TCGA: hazard ratio
   (HR), 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-3.31; p = 0.111;
   METABRIC: HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 0.45-3.08; p = 0.419]. This is the first
   study to preliminarily elucidate the role of KMT2C mutations in Chinese
   patients with breast cancer and further identified significant KMT2C
   mutation differences according to race and ethnicity. KMT2C might be a
   susceptibility gene of Chinese patients with ILC that would help define
   high-risk groups that could benefit from adapted, personalized screening
   strategies.

AB Although studies have provided significant evidence about the role of
   RAS in mediating cancer risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM),
   conclusions about the central molecular mechanisms underlying this
   disease remain to be reached, because this type of information requires
   an integrative multi-omics approach. In the current study, meta-analysis
   was performed on type 2 diabetes and breast, bladder, liver, pancreas,
   colon and rectum cancer-associated transcriptome data, and reporter
   biomolecules were identified at RNA, protein, and metabolite levels
   using the integration of gene expression profiles with genome-scale
   biomolecular networks in diabetes samples. This approach revealed that
   RAS biomarkers could be associated with cancer initiation and
   progression, which include metabolites (particularly, aminoacyl-tRNA
   biosynthesis and ABC transporters) as novel biomarker candidates and
   potential therapeutic targets. We detected downregulation and
   upregulation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in blood,
   pancreatic islets, liver and skeletal muscle from normal and diabetic
   patients. DEGs were combined with 211 renin-angiotensin-system related
   genes. Upregulated genes were enriched using Pathway analysis of cancer
   in pancreatic islets, blood and skeletal muscle samples. It seems that
   the changes in mRNA are contributing to the phenotypic changes in
   carcinogenesis, or that they are as a result of the phenotypic changes
   associated with the malignant transformation. Our analyses showed that
   Ctsg and Ednrb are downregulated in cancer samples. However, by
   immunohistochemistry experiments we observed that EDNRB protein showed
   increased expression in tumor samples. It is true that alterations in
   mRNA expression do not always reflect alterations in protein expression,
   since post-translational changes can occur in proteins. In this study,
   we report valuable data for further experimental and clinical analysis,
   because the proposed biomolecules have significant potential as systems
   biomarkers for screening or for therapeutic purposes in type 2 diabetes
   and cancer-associated pathways.

AB Epigenetic aberrations are prominent in bladder cancer (BC) and
   contribute to disease pathogenesis. We characterized histone deacetylase
   (HDAC) expression, a family of deacetylation enzymes, in both in vitro
   and in vivo BC model systems and analyzed expression data from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis was used to determine
   the expression status of Class I and II HDACs in ten human BC cell
   lines, while qRT-PCR was used to determine HDAC expression in 24 human
   tumor specimens. The TCGA cohort consists of 408 muscle invasive BC
   (MIBC) clinical samples and analysis of this data set identified
   expression of HDAC4 and -9 as being associated with basal-squamous
   disease. These findings agree with qRT-PCR results identifying increased
   expression of HDAC4, -7, and -9 in basal BC cell lines (p < 0.05;
   Kruskal-Wallis test) and in clinical specimens with invasive bladder
   cancer (not statistically significant). We also observed increased
   expression in Hdac4, -7, and -9 in commonly used BC mouse models. Here,
   we identify suitable preclinical model systems for the study of HDACs,
   and show increased expression of Class IIa HDACs, specifically HDAC4 and
   HDAC9, in basal BC cell lines and in invasive clinical specimens. These
   results suggest this class of HDACs may be best suited for targeted
   inhibition in patients with basal BC.

AB BACKGROUND: In standard high throughput sequencing analysis, genetic
   variants are not assigned to a homologous chromosome of origin. This
   process, called haplotype phasing, can reveal information important for
   understanding the relationship between genetic variants and biological
   phenotypes. For example, in genes that carry multiple heterozygous
   missense variants, phasing resolves whether one or both gene copies are
   altered. Here, we present a novel approach to phasing variants that
   takes advantage of unique properties of paired tumor:normal sequencing
   data from cancer studies.
   RESULTS: VAF phasing uses changes in variant allele frequency (VAF)
   between tumor and normal samples in regions of somatic chromosomal gain
   or loss to phase germline variants. We apply VAF phasing to 6180 samples
   from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and demonstrate that our method is
   highly concordant with other standard phasing methods, and can phase an
   average of 33% more variants than other read-backed phasing methods.
   Using variant annotation tools designed to score gene haplotypes, we
   find a suggestive association between carrying multiple missense
   variants in a single copy of a cancer predisposition gene and earlier
   age of cancer diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: VAF phasing exploits unique properties of tumor genomes to
   increase the number of germline variants that can be phased over
   standard read-backed methods in paired tumor:normal samples. Our
   phase-informed association testing results call attention to the need to
   develop more tools for assessing the joint effect of multiple genetic
   variants.

AB BACKGROUND: Aberrant spliced isoforms are specifically associated with
   cancer progression and metastasis. The cytoplasmic adaptor CRKL (v-crk
   avian sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog-like) is a CRK like
   proto-oncogene, which encodes a SH2 and SH3 (src homology)
   domain-containing adaptor protein. CRKL is tightly linked to leukemia
   via its binding partners BCR-ABL and TEL-ABL, upregulated in multiple
   types of human cancers, and induce cancer cell proliferation and
   invasion. However, it remains unclear whether signaling adaptors such as
   CRKL could regulate alternative splicing.
   METHODS: We analyzed the expression level of CRKL in 305 cervical cancer
   tissue samples available in TCGA database, and then selected two groups
   of cancer samples with CRKL differentially expressed to analyzed
   potential CRKL-regulated alternative splicing events (ASEs). CRKL was
   knocked down by shRNA to further study CRKL-regulated alternative
   splicing and the activity of SR protein kinases in HeLa cells using
   RNA-Seq and Western blot techniques. We validated 43 CRKL-regulated ASEs
   detected by RNA-seq in HeLa cells, using RT-qPCR analysis of HeLa cell
   samples and using RNA-seq data of the two group of clinical cervical
   samples.
   RESULTS: The expression of CRKL was mostly up-regulated in stage I
   cervical cancer samples. Knock-down of CRKL led to a reduced cell
   proliferation. CRKL-regulated alternative splicing of a large number of
   genes were enriched in cancer-related functional pathways, among which
   DNA repair and G2/M mitotic cell cycle, GnRH signaling were shared among
   the top 10 enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways by results from clinical
   samples and HeLa cell model. We showed that CRKL-regulated ASEs revealed
   by computational analysis using ABLas software in HeLa cell were highly
   validated by RT-qPCR, and also validated by cervical cancer clinical
   samples.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of CRKL-regulation of the
   alternative splicing of a number of genes critical in tumorigenesis and
   cancer progression, which is consistent with CRKL reported role as a
   signaling adaptor and a kinase. Our results underline that the signaling
   adaptor CRKL might integrate the external and intrinsic cellular signals
   and coordinate the dynamic activation of cellular signaling pathways
   including alternative splicing regulation.

AB BACKGROUND Adenocarcinoma of the lung is a type of non-small cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC). Clinical outcome is associated with tumor grade, stage,
   and subtype. This study aimed to identify RNA expression profiles,
   including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA,
   associated with clinical outcome in adenocarcinoma of the lung using
   bioinformatics data. MATERIAL AND METHODS The miRNA and mRNA expression
   profiles were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database,
   and lncRNA expression profiles were downloaded from The Atlas of
   Noncoding RNAs in Cancer (TANRIC) database. The independent dataset, the
   Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession dataset, GSE81089, was used. RNA
   expression profiles were used to identify comprehensive prognostic RNA
   signatures based on patient survival time. RESULTS From 7,704 lncRNAs,
   787 miRNAs, and 28,937 mRNAs of 449 patients, four joint RNA molecular
   signatures were identified, including RP11-909N17.2, RP11-14N7.2
   (lncRNAs), MIR139 (miRNA), KLHDC8B (mRNA). The random forest (RF)
   classifier was used to test the prediction ability of patient survival
   risk and showed a good predictive accuracy of 71% and also showed a
   significant difference in overall survival (log-rank P=0.0002; HR, 3.54;
   95% CI, 1.74-7.19). The combined RNA signature also showed good
   performance in the identification of patient survival in the validation
   and independent datasets. CONCLUSIONS This study identified four RNA
   sequences as a prognostic molecular signature in adenocarcinoma of the
   lung, which may also provide an increased understanding of the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this malignancy.

AB Cancers are known to be associated with accelerated aging, but to date,
   there has been a paucity of systematic and in-depth studies of the
   correlation between aging and cancer. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles
   can be used as aging markers and utilized to construct aging predictors.
   In this study, we downloaded 333 paired samples of DNAm, expression and
   mutation profiles encompassing 11 types of tissues from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) public access portal. The DNA methylation aging
   scores were calculated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine
   regression model. We report that the DNAm aging scores of cancers
   revealed significant aging acceleration compared to adjacent normal
   tissues. Afterwards, aging acceleration associated mutation modules and
   expression modules were identified in 11 types of cancers. In addition,
   we constructed bipartite networks of mutations and expression, and the
   differential expression modules related to aging associated mutations
   were selected in 11 types of cancers using the eQTL method. The results
   of enrichment analyses also identified common functions across cancers
   and cancer-specific characteristics of aging acceleration. The aging
   acceleration interaction network across cancers suggested the core
   status of thyroid carcinoma (THCA) and neck squamous cell carcinoma
   (HNSC) in the aging process. In summary, we have identified correlations
   between aging and cancers and revealed insights into the biological
   functions of the modules in aging and cancers.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation
   between TRMT6 mRNA expression levels and clinicopathological features in
   primary HCC patients and to evaluate their prognostic value.
   Material/Methods: The clinical information and the mRNA sequencing data
   of the patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were
   extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Liver Cancer database. The
   correlation between the clinicopathological features and the expression
   of TRMT6 was analyzed by t test and chi-square test. The overall
   survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated using
   the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models. Gene set enrichment
   analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the potential mechanisms of TRMT6
   dysregulation in primary HCC patients.
   Results: Compared to normal tissues, TRMT6 was significantly upregulated
   in primary HCC tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that
   higher TRMT6 expression was associated with reduced RFS (p= 0.0146) and
   OS (p= 0.0224) in HCC patients. Moreover, multivariable Cox regression
   analysis indicated that TRMT6 upregulation independently predicted poor
   RFS (HR: 1.871, 95% CI: 1.204, 2.905, p= 0.005) and OS (HR: 2.176, 95%
   CI: 1.234, 3.836, p= 0.007). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
   indicated that primary HCC samples in the TRMT6 high expression group
   were enriched for the G2M checkpoint, spermatogenesis, and MYC target
   genes.
   Conclusions: TRMT6 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and higher TRMT6
   expression levels was correlated with reduced OS and RFS in patients
   with primary HCC. TRMT6 might be a promising prognostic biomarker for
   poor clinical outcomes in primary HCC patients.

AB PURPOSE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) play critical roles in cancer
   development. In this study, we aimed to explore the function and
   possible molecular mechanism of HMMR-AS1 involved in lung adenocarcinoma
   (LUAD).
   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Firstly, we analyzed HMMR-AS1 expression in LUAD
   tissues with the sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
   Next, we evaluated the effects of HMMR-AS1 on LUAD cell proliferation
   and apoptosis, and its regulation of miR-138 by acting as a ceRNA. The
   animal model was used to support the in vitro experimental findings.
   RESULTS: HMMR-AS1 expression was significantly upregulated in LUAD
   tissues and was associated with larger tumor diameter, advanced TNM
   stage, lymph node metastasis, and shorter survival. Knockdown of
   HMMR-AS1 induced apoptosis and growth arrest in vitro and inhibited
   tumorigenesis in mouse xenografts. Mechanistically, HMMR-AS1 functioned
   as a ceRNA of miR-138, thereby leading to repression of its endogenous
   target sirt6. Moreover, knockdown of HMMR-AS1 dramatically inhibited
   tumor growth and metastasis of LUAD in vivo.
   CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, HMMR-AS1 is significantly over-expressed in
   LUAD, and HMMR-AS1-miR-138-sirt6 axis play a critical role in LUAD
   tumorigenesis. Our findings highlight an oncogenic role of HMMR-AS1 in
   LUAD.

TI Knockdown of tripartite motif 59 (TRIM59) inhibits proliferation in

AB Aim: We analysed multiple microarray datasets in the Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets for messenger
   RNAs (mRNAs) whose expression is apparently increased in human
   cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) samples, compared with that in the adjacent
   normal biliary epithelial tissue. The results revealed that the
   expression of tripartite motif-containing 59 (TRIM59) was significantly
   increased in the CCA tissue samples. TRIM59 is a member of the
   tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which contains a highly
   conserved N-terminal an interesting new gene (RING) domain regulating
   transcriptional factors and tumorigenesis. In the present study, we
   investigated the effects of TRIM59 expression on tumour growth in CCA.
   Materials and methods: After analyzing the microarray datasets from the
   TCGA database and GEO DataSets, we screened out 291 target genes, which
   are significantly overexpressed in CCA tissues, and TRIM59 was one of
   them. The quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
   (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to
   determine the expression of TRIM59 in CCA tissues (n = 65) and cell
   lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to assess the
   prognosis of TRIM59 in patients with CCA. A specific siRNA (siRNA-1008)
   was used to inhibit the expression of TRIM59 in HCCC9810 and HUCCT1 cell
   lines. The effects of TRIM59 silencing on cell proliferation were
   assessed by the CCK-8, colony-formation, and EDU incorporation assays.
   Furthermore, the effects of TRIM59 knockdown on cell apoptosis and cell
   cycle were determined by flow cytometry. The in vivo effects were
   evaluated using a mouse tumorigenic model. Western blotting was also
   performed to verify the relationship between knockdown of TRIM59 and
   activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
   Results: TRIM59 was highly expressed in CCA tissues. The knockdown of
   TRIM59 obviously reduced the proliferation and colony formation
   abilities of CCA cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the cell
   apoptosis analysis results showed that TRIM59 silencing apparently
   promoted CCA cell apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Our
   preliminary results indicate that the down-regulation of TRIM59 levels
   might restrict the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed that TRIM59 is up-regulated in CCA
   tissues and cell lines and promoted CCA cell proliferation, possibly by
   affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.

AB Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), also known as stomach adenocarcinoma
   (STAD), is one of the most lethal malignancies in the world. It is vital
   to classify and detect the hub genes and key pathways participated in
   the initiation and progression of GAC. In this study, we collected and
   sequenced 15 pairs of GAC tumor tissues and the adjacent normal tissues.
   Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed and Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO)
   analysis were used to annotate the unique biological significance and
   important pathways of enriched DEGs. Moreover, we constructed the
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by Cytoscape and conducted
   KEGG enrichment analysis of the prime module. We further applied the
   TCGA database to start the survival analysis of these hub genes by
   Kaplan-Meier estimates. Finally, we obtained total 233 DEGs consisted of
   64 up-regulated genes and 169 down-regulated genes. GO enrichment
   analysis found that DEGs most significantly enriched in single organism
   process, extracellular region, and extracellular region part. KEGG
   pathway enrichment analysis suggested that DEGs most significantly
   enriched in Protein digestion and absorption, Gastric acid secretion,
   and ECM-receptor interaction. Furthermore, the PPI network showed that
   the top 10 hub genes in GAC were IL8, COL1A1, MMP9, SST, COL1A2, TIMP1,
   FN1, SPARC, ALDH1A1, and SERPINE1 respectively. The prime gene
   interaction module in PPI network was enriched in protein digestion and
   absorption, ECM receptor interaction, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,
   and pathway in cancer. Survival analysis based on the TCGA database
   found that the expression of the FN1, SERPINE1, and SPARC significantly
   predicted poor prognosis of GAC. Collectively, we identified several hub
   genes and key pathways associated with GAC initiation and progression by
   analyzing the microarray data on DEGs, which provided a detailed
   molecular mechanism underlying GAC occurrence and progression.

AB Single-stranded circular RNAs (circRNAs), generated through
   'backsplicing', occur more extensively than initially anticipated. The
   possible functions of the vast majority of circRNAs remain unknown.
   Virus-derived circRNAs have recently been described in
   gamma-herpesviruses. We report that oncogenic human papillomaviruses
   (HPVs) generate circRNAs, some of which encompass the E7 oncogene
   (circE7). HPV16 circE7 is detectable by both inverse RT-PCR and northern
   blotting of HPV16-transformed cells. CircE7 is N-6-methyladenosine
   (m(6)A) modified, preferentially localized to the cytoplasm, associated
   with polysomes, and translated to produce E7 oncoprotein. Specific
   disruption of circE7 in CaSki cervical carcinoma cells reduces E7
   protein levels and inhibits cancer cell growth both in vitro and in
   tumor xenografts. CircE7 is present in TCGA RNA-Seq data from
   HPV-positive cancers and in cell lines with only episomal HPVs. These
   results provide evidence that virus-derived, protein-encoding circular
   RNAs are biologically functional and linked to the transforming
   properties of some HPV.

AB DNA Polymerase Theta (POLQ) is a DNA polymerase involved in error-prone
   translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and error-prone repair of DNA
   double-strand breaks (DSBs). In the present study, we examined whether
   abnormal POLQ expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of lung
   adenocarcinoma (LAC). First, we found overexpression of POLQ at both the
   mRNA and protein levels in LAC, using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database and by immunohistochemical analysis of our LAC series.
   POLQ overexpression was associated with an advanced pathologic stage and
   an increased total number of somatic mutations in LAC. When H1299 human
   lung cancer cell clones overexpressing POLQ were established and
   examined, the clones showed resistance to a DSB-inducing chemical in the
   clonogenic assay and an increased frequency of mutations in the supF
   forward mutation assay. Further analysis revealed that POLQ
   overexpression was also positively correlated with Polo Like Kinase 4
   (PLK4) overexpression in LAC, and that PLK4 overexpression in the
   POLQ-overexpressing H1299 cells induced centrosome amplification.
   Finally, analysis of the TCGA data revealed that POLQ overexpression was
   associated with an increased somatic mutation load and PLK4
   overexpression in diverse human cancers; on the other hand,
   overexpressions of nine TLS polymerases other than POLQ were associated
   with an increased somatic mutation load at a much lower frequency. Thus,
   POLQ overexpression is associated with advanced pathologic stage,
   increased somatic mutation load, and PLK4 overexpression, the last
   inducing centrosome amplification, in LAC, suggesting that POLQ
   overexpression is involved in the pathogenesis of LAC.

AB An increasing number of studies implicates the NF-kappaB (Nuclear Factor
   of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells) alternative pathway in
   non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed the clinical
   significance of CD40 (Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member
   5, TNFRSF5), BAFFR (B-cell activating factor receptor), RANK (Receptor
   activator of NF-kappaB) and LTbetaR (lymphotoxin beta receptor)
   receptors, which activate the alternative pathway of NF-kappaB, in
   NSCLC. Evaluation of CD40, BAFFR, RANK and LTbetaR expression was
   performed based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the
   Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets, while protein expression was
   assessed by immunohistochemistry in specimens from 119 operated NSCLC
   patients. CD40 gene overexpression was correlated with improved
   five-year overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001), while increased BAFFR and
   LTbetaR mRNA levels were associated with worse OS in patients with
   adenocarcinomas (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Similarly,
   patients with adenocarcinomas exhibited a negative correlation between
   membranous BAFFR protein expression in carcinoma cells and three- and
   five-year survival (p = 0.021; HR, 4.977 and p = 0.030; HR, 3.358,
   respectively) as well as between BAFFR protein overexpression in
   cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and two-year survival (p = 0.036;
   HR, 1.983). Patients with increased LTbetaR nuclear protein staining or
   stage II patients with lower cytoplasmic LTbetaR protein expression had
   worse five-year OS (p = 0.039 and p = 0.008, respectively). Moreover,
   CD40 protein expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and
   CAFs was positively associated with metastatic spread while BAFFR
   protein expression in CAFs was negatively associated with bone
   metastasis (p = 0.041). Our data suggests that CD40, BAFFR, RANK and
   LTbetaR play an important role in NSCLC and further supports the role of
   NF-kappaB alternative pathway in NSCLC.

AB Improved prognostic biomarkers are needed to guide personalized prostate
   cancer (PC) treatment decisions. Due to the prominent molecular
   heterogeneity of PC, multimarker panels may be more robust. Here, 25
   selected top-candidate miRNA and methylation markers for PC were
   profiled by qPCR in malignant radical prostatectomy (RP) tissue
   specimens from 198 PC patients (Cohort 1, training). Using GLMnet, we
   trained a novel multimarker model (miMe) comprising nine miRNAs and
   three methylation markers that predicted postoperative biochemical
   recurrence (BCR) independently of the established clinicopathological
   CAPRA-S nomogram in Cox multivariate regression analysis in Cohort 1 (HR
   [95% CI]: 1.53 [1.26-1.84], p < 0.001). This result was successfully
   validated in two independent RP cohorts (Cohort 2, n =159: HR [95% CI]:
   1.35 [1.06-1.73], p = 0.015. TCGA, n =350: HR [95% CI]: 1.34
   [1.01-1.77], p= 0.04). Notably, in CAPRA-S low-risk patients, a high
   miMe score was associated with >6 times higher risk of BCR, suggesting
   that miMe may help identify PC patients at high risk of progression
   despite favorable clinicopathological factors postsurgery. Finally, miMe
   was a significant predictor of cancer-specific survival (p = 0.019,
   log-rank test) in a merged analysis of 357 RP patients. In conclusion,
   we trained, tested and validated a novel 12-marker panel (miMe) that
   showed significant independent prognostic value in three RP cohorts. In
   the future, combining miMe score with existing clinical nomograms may
   improve PC risk stratification and thus help guide treatment decisions.

AB Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) family is involved in
   tumorigenesis in different types of cancer. However, the importance of
   KLF family in gastric cancer is unclear. Here, we examined KLF gene
   expression in five paired liver metastases and primary gastric cancer
   tissues by RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry was used to study KLF8
   expression in 206 gastric cancer samples. The impact of KLF8 expression
   on glycolysis, an altered energy metabolism that characterizes cancer
   cells, was evaluated. KLF8 showed the highest up-regulation in liver
   metastases compared with primary tumours among all KLF members. Higher
   KLF8 expression associated with larger tumour size (P<0.001), advanced T
   stage (P=0.003) and N stage (P<0.001). High KLF8 expression implied
   shorter survival outcome in both TCGA and validation cohort (P<0.05).
   Silencing KLF8 expression impaired the glycolysis rate of gastric cancer
   cells in vitro. Moreover, high KLF8 expression positively associated
   with SUVmax in patient samples. KLF8 activated the GLUT4 promoter
   activity in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Importantly, KLF8 and
   GLUT4 showed consistent expression patterns in gastric cancer tissues.
   These findings suggest that KLF8 modulates glycolysis by targeting GLUT4
   and could serve as a novel biomarker for survival and potential
   therapeutic target in gastric cancer.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to uncover a regulatory network comprised of
   long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs
   (mRNAs) in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), to explore its
   underlying mechanisms and development, and to identify key genetic
   biomarkers for the prognosis of LSCC.
   METHODS: Here, we compared mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA expression profiles
   between 111 LSCC and 12 adjacent normal tissues using RNA sequencing
   (RNA-Seq) data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on
   the interaction information obtained from miRcode, TargetScan,
   miRTarBase, and miRDB, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA
   (ceRNA) network was constructed using differentially expressed lncRNAs
   (DElncRNA), miRNAs (DEmiRNA), and mRNAs (DEmRNA). By assessing the
   functional enrichment of DEmRNAs in this network, the potential
   underlying mechanisms were explored. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival
   analysis was used to assess genetic biomarkers related to the prognosis
   of LSCC patients.
   RESULTS: Upon comparing LSCC and control tissues, 1640 DElncRNAs, 75
   DEmiRNAs, and 3217 DEmRNAs were identified. Based on the prediction
   between lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA relationships, we constructed a
   ceRNA network comprised of 93 lncRNAs, nine miRNAs, and nine mRNAs. This
   network predicted that two lncRNAs (AC016773.1 and C00299), two mRNAs
   (DIO1 and STC2), and two miRNAs (hsa-mir-137 and hsa-mir-210) were
   significant biomarkers of LSCC prognosis according to thorough
   topological and survival analyses (P<.05).
   CONCLUSION: Through a ceRNA network analysis, our study identifies new
   lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, which can be used as potential biomarkers of
   LSCC and as therapeutic targets for treating LSCC, thus laying a
   foundation for future clinical studies.

AB Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the main causes of death
   induced by cancer globally. However, the molecular aberrations in NSCLC
   patients remain unclearly. In the present study, four messenger RNA
   microarray datasets (GSE18842, GSE40275, GSE43458, and GSE102287) were
   downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.
   Differentially expressed genes(DEGs) between NSCLC tissues and adjacent
   lung tissues were obtained from GEO2R and the overlapping DEGs were
   identified. Moreover, functional and pathway enrichment were performed
   by Funrich, while the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
   construction were obtained from STRING and hub genes were visualized and
   identified by Cytoscape software. Furthermore, validation, overall
   survival (OS) and tumor staging analysis of selected hub genes were
   performed by GEPIA. A total of 367 DEGs (95 upregulated and 272
   downregulated) were obtained through gene integration analysis. The PPI
   network consisted of 94 nodes and 1036 edges in the upregulated DEGs and
   272 nodes and 464 edges in the downregulated DEGs, respectively. The PPI
   network identified 46 upregulated and 27 downregulated hub genes among
   the DEGs, and six (such as CENPE, NCAPH, MYH11, LRRK2, HSD17B6, and A2M)
   of that have not been identified to be associated with NSCLC so far.
   Moreover, the expression differences of the mentioned hub genes were
   consistent with that in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell
   carcinoma in the TCGA database. Further analysis showed that all the six
   hub genes were associated with tumor staging except MYH11, while only
   the upregulated DEG CENPE was associated with the worse OS of patients
   with NSCLC. In conclusion, the current study showed that CENPE, NCAPH,
   MYH11, LRRK2, HSD17B6, and A2M might be the key genes contributed to
   tumorigenesis or tumor progression in NSCLC, further functional study is
   needed to explore the involved mechanisms.

AB Hydroxy acid oxidase 2 (HAO2) has been reported to inhibit tumor
   progression through metabolic pathway. The current study was designed to
   evaluate the prognostic significance and probable mechanism of HAO2 in
   patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The study
   screened The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC)
   database for patients with ccRCC having complete clinical information
   and HAO2 expression. Low HAO2 was associated with shorter overall
   survival (OS) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS). Gene set
   enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed HAO2 was associated with neutral lipid
   catabolic process, metabolic process, lipid oxidation,
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
   oncogene signaling (KRAS). Western blot analysis and
   immunohistochemistry analysis checked HAO2 expression in ccRCC cancer
   tissues, normal tissues, and renal cancer cell lines. HAO2 was
   downregulated in ccRCC cancer tissues and ccRCC cell lines when compared
   with their control group. Overexpression of HAO2 by plasmid promoted
   lipid catabolic process, eliminated lipid accumulation, inhibited KRAS
   expression, controlled the proliferation, migration, and invasion
   activity of ccRCC tumor cells. Our results indicated that HAO2 inhibits
   malignancy ccRCC by promoting lipid catabolic process, HAO2 could be an
   effective molecular marker and treatment for ccRCC.

   the tumor may be histopathologically indistinguishable. The authors
   examined the biological basis of this heterogeneity using computational
   methods.
   METHODS: The authors collected both fluorescent and nonfluorescent GBM
   specimens from a total of 14 patients undergoing surgery and examined
   their gene expression profiles.
   RESULTS: In this study, the authors found that the gene expression
   patterns characterizing fluorescent and nonfluorescent GBM surgical
   specimens were profoundly different and were associated with distinct
   cellular functions and different biological pathways. Nonfluorescent
   tumor tissue tended to resemble the neural subtype of GBM; meanwhile,
   fluorescent tumor tissue did not exhibit a prominent pattern
   corresponding to known subtypes of GBM. Consistent with this
   observation, neural GBM samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database
   exhibited a significantly lower fluorescence score than nonneural GBM
   samples as determined by a fluorescence gene signature developed by the
   authors.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a greater understanding regarding the
   biological basis of differential fluorescence observed intraoperatively
   and can provide a basis to identify novel strategies to maximize the
   effectiveness of fluorescence agents.

AB BackgroundProstate cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease. Despite
   being clinically similar, some tumours are more likely to recur after
   surgery compared to others. Distinguishing those that need adjuvant or
   salvage radiotherapy will improve patient outcomes. The goal of this
   study was to identify circulating microRNA that could independently
   predict prostate cancer patient risk stratification after radical
   prostatectomy.MethodsSeventy-eight prostate cancer patients were
   recruited at the Odette Cancer Centre in Sunnybrook Health Sciences
   Centre. All patients had previously undergone radical prostatectomy.
   Blood samples were collected simultaneously for PSA testing and miRNA
   analysis using NanoString nCounter technology. Of the 78 samples, 75 had
   acceptable miRNA quantity and quality. Patients were stratified into
   high- and low-risk categories based on Gleason score, pathological T
   stage, surgical margin status, and diagnostic PSA: patients with
   Gleason8; pT3a and positive margin; pT3b and any margin; or diagnostic
   PSA>20 mu g/mL were classified as high-risk (n=44) and all other
   patients were classified as low-risk (n=31).ResultsUsing our patient
   dataset, we identified a four-miRNA signature (miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b,
   miR-106a) that can distinguish high- and low-risk patients, in addition
   to their pathological tumour stage. High expression of these miRNAs is
   associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence in the TCGA
   dataset. These miRNAs confer an aggressive phenotype upon overexpression
   in vitro.ConclusionsThis proof-of-principle report highlights the
   potential of circulating miRNAs to independently predict risk
   stratification of prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.

AB Alternative polyadenylation (APA) has emerged as a prevalent feature
   associated with cancer development and progression. The advantage of APA
   to tumor progression is to induce oncogenes through 3'-UTR shortening,
   and to inactivate tumor suppressor genes via the re-routing of microRNA
   competition. We previously identified the Mammalian Cleavage Factor I-25
   (CFIm25) (encoded by Nudt21 gene) as a master APA regulator whose
   expression levels directly impact the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma
   (GBM) in vitro and in vivo. Despite its importance, the role of Nudt21
   in GBM development is not known and the genes subject to Nudt21 APA
   regulation that contribute to GBM progression have not been identified.
   Here, we find that Nudt21 is reduced in low grade glioma (LGG) and all
   four subtypes of high grade glioma (GBM). Reduced expression of Nudt21
   associates with worse survival in TCGA LGG cohorts and two TCGA GBM
   cohorts. Moreover, although CFIm25 was initially identified as
   biochemically associated with both CFIm59 and CFIm68, we observed three
   CFIm distinct subcomplexes exist and CFIm59 protein level is dependent
   on Nudt21 expression in GBM cells, but CFIm68 is not, and that only
   CFIm59 predicts prognosis of GBM patients similar to Nudt21. Through the
   use of Poly(A)-Click-Seq to characterize APA, we define the mRNAs
   subject to 3'-UTR shortening upon Nudt21 depletion in GBM cells and
   observed enrichment in genes important in the Ras signaling pathway,
   including Pak1. Remarkably, we find that Pak1 expression is regulated by
   Nudt21 through its 3'-UTR APA, and the combination of Pak1 and Nudt21
   expression generates an even stronger prognostic indicator of GBM
   survival versus either value used alone. Collectively, our data uncover
   Nudt21 and its downstream target Pak1 as a potential "combination
   biomarker" for predicting prognosis of GBM patients.

AB Background. Normal epithelial cells rapidly undergo apoptosis as soon as
   they lose contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is termed
   as anoikis. However, cancer cells tend to develop a resistance mechanism
   to anoikis. This acquired ability is termed as anoikis resistance.
   Cancer cells, with anoikis resistance, can spread to distant tissues or
   organs via the peripheral circulatory system and cause cancer
   metastasis. Thus, inhibition of anoikis resistance blocks the metastatic
   ability of cancer cells. Methods. Anoikis-resistant CAL27 (CAL27(AR))
   cells were induced from CAL27 cells using the suspension culture
   approach. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA-Seq to study
   the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the CAL27(AR) cells
   and the parental CAL27 cells. Gene function annotation and Gene Ontology
   (GO) enrichment analysis were performed using DAVID database. Signaling
   pathways involved in DEGs were analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment
   Analysis (GSEA) software. Analysis results were confirmed by reverse
   transcription PCR (RT-PCR), western blotting, and gene correlation
   analysis based on the TCGA database. Results. GO enrichment analysis
   indicated that the biological process (BP) of the DEGs was associated
   with epidermal development, DNA replication, and G1/S transition of the
   mitotic cell cycle. The analysis of cellular component (CC) showed that
   the most significant up-regulated genes were related to extracellular
   exosome. KEGG Pathway analysis revealed that 23 signaling pathways were
   activated (p-value <= 0.05, FDR q-value <= 0.05) and 22 signaling
   pathways were suppressed (p-value <= 0.05, FDR q-value <= 0.05). The
   results from the GSEA indicated that in contrast to the inhibition of
   EGFR signaling pathway, the VEGF signaling pathway was activated. The
   VEGF signaling pathway possibly activates STAT3 though induction of
   STAT3 phosphorylation. Gene correlation analysis revealed that the
   VEGFA-STAT3-KLF4-CDKN1A signal axis was not only present in head and
   neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) but also two other epithelial-derived
   carcinomas that highly express VEGFA, including kidney renal clear cell
   carcinoma (KIRC) and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV).

TI MicroRNA-200b is downregulated and suppresses metastasis by targeting

AB BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the primary cause of tumor death in renal cell
   carcinoma (RCC). Improved diagnostic markers of metastasis are
   critically needed for RCC. MicoRNAs are demonstrated to be stable and
   significant biomarkers for several malignancies. In this study, we aimed
   to explore the metastasis related microRNAs and its mechanism in RCC.
   METHODS: The relationship between microRNAs expression and prognosis and
   metastasis of RCC patients were explored by data mining through
   expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 80
   RCC tissues and adjacent normal kidney tissues were obtained from
   Department of Urology, Peking University First Hospital. Expression of
   microRNA-200b (miR-200b) in RCC tissues and cell lines were determined
   by bioinformatic data mining and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
   The effects of miR-200b on cell proliferation, migration and invasion
   were determined by cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assay, wound
   healing assay and Boyden chamber assay. Mouse cell-derived xenograft and
   patient-derived xenograft model were also performed to evaluate the
   effects of miR-200b on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The
   molecular mechanism of miR-200b function was investigated using
   bioinformatic target predication and high-throughput cDNA sequencing
   (RNA-seq) and validated by luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, Western
   blot and immunostaining in vitro and in vivo.
   FINDINGS: Our findings indicates that miR-200b is frequently
   downregulated and have potential utility as a biomarker of metastasis
   and prognosis in RCC. Interestingly, ectopic expression of miR-200b in
   the Caki-1 and OSRC-2 cell lines suppresses cell migration and invasion
   in vitro as well as tumor metastases in vivo. However, miR-200b has no
   effect on cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In
   addition, bioinformatics target predication and RNA-seq results reveals
   that Laminin subunit alpha 4 (LAMA4) is one target of miR-200b and
   significantly inhibited by miR-200b in vitro and in vivo.
   INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate a previously undescribed role
   of miR-200b as a suppressor of tumor metastasis in RCC by directly
   destabilizing LAMA4 mRNA.

AB BackgroundEndometrial carcinoma still threatens the health of women.
   Thus, to explore how long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 01220
   regulates the development of endometrial carcinoma (EC).MethodsWhole
   genome expression profile data of EC and paracancerous tissues in TCGA
   database were downloaded. LINC01220 expression in EC and paracancerous
   tissues of patients in our hospital was detected by qRT-PCR.
   Furthermore, the relationship between LINC01220 expression and
   clinicopathological features of EC patients was analyzed. After
   transfected with sh-LINC01220 and pcDNA-MAPK11 in EC cells,
   proliferative, colony formation abilities and apoptosis were determined
   by CCK-8, colony formation assay and flow cytometry, respectively.
   Western blot was conducted to determine the regulatory role of LINC01220
   on MAPK11.ResultsTCGA data showed LINC01220 expression is markedly
   higher in EC tissues than that of paracancerous tissues, which was
   consistent with out detection in EC patients of our hospital. LINC01220
   expression was positively correlated to pathological grade and FIGO
   stage of EC patients. After knockdown of LINC01220 in EC cells,
   proliferative and colony formation abilities decreased, whereas
   apoptotic rate increased. Cor function analysis revealed the positive
   correlation between LINC01220 and MAPK11 in EC. MAPK11 expression was
   regulated by LINC01220 in EC cells. Overexpression of MAPK11 can reverse
   the tumor suppressing effect of LINC01220 on EC.ConclusionsLINC01220
   promotes EC development by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting
   apoptosis of EC cells through upregulating MAPK11.

TI Nicotine promotes the development of non-small cell lung cancer through
   activating LINC00460 and PI3K/Akt signaling.
SO Bioscience reports
DI 10.1042/BSR20182443
PD 2019-May-23
PY 2019
AB OBJECTIVE: Nicotine, the main ingredient in tobacco, is identified to
   facilitate tumorigenesis and accelerate metastasis in tumor. Studies in
   recent years have reported that long intergenic non-protein coding RNA
   460 (LINC00460) is strongly associated with lung cancer poor prognosis
   and nicotine dependence. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether nicotine
   promotes the development of lung cancer through activation of LINC00460.
   METHODS: We determined that LINC00460 expression in lung cancer tissues
   and the prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
   using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) website and
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Through in vitro experiments,
   we studied the effects of nicotine on LINC00460 in NSCLC cells lines
   using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell test, flow cytometry,
   quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
   and western blot assays.
   RESULTS: We identified the significant upregulated expression level of
   LINC00460 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, especially, the negative
   correlation of LINC00460 expression level with overall survival (OS). In
   vitro experiments, LINC00460 was over expressed in NSCLC cell lines
   under nicotine stimulation. Nicotine could relieve the effect of
   LINC00460 knockdown on NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and
   apoptosis. The same influence was observed on PI3K/Akt signaling
   pathway.
   CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this is the first time to examine the potential
   roles of LINC00460 in lung cancer cell proliferation, migration and
   apoptosis induced by nicotine. This may help to develop novel
   therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of metastatic
   tumors from cigarette smoke caused lung cancer by blocking the
   nicotine-activated LINC00460 pathway.

   interactions were used for pathway enrichment. Differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs) between high methylation level / high miRNA expression
   level (H/H) and low methylation level / low miRNA expression level (L/L)
   samples were screened. The correlations of epigenetic interactions with

   cg26691953-hsa-mir-195-CCNT1, etc. A total of 95 epigenetic interactions
   were significantly associated with prognosis. Among all the identified
   DEGs, low-expressed RASSF4, ZNF704, TFDP1, PLXNB2, TMC04, ZNF878, ARIDIB
   and high-expressed ZNF704, ZNF451, THOP1, IGF1R were related with poor

   CCL11 were related with good prognosis. Fifteen epigenetic interactions
   were significantly related with clinical features. Gene expression and
   N-glycan trimming in the ER and Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle were two
   significant enriched pathways. Interactions of
   cg14146378-hsa-mir-205-ARID1B and cg15375596-has-miR-1275-IGF1R may be

AB The prognosis of ovarian cancer (OC) remains poor. Thus, the present
   study aims to identify independently prognostic factor in patients with
   OC. OC gene expression study GSE26712 and TCGA-OV were included in the
   study. Prognosis associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   between normal ovarian tissue and OC were identified. LASSO Cox
   proportional hazards regression model was conducted and a prognostic
   signature was constructed based on these DEGs. The predictive ability of
   the signature was analyzed in the training set and test set. The
   prognosis performance of the signature was compared with CA-125 and HE4.
   Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify relevant
   mechanism. 332 DEGs were identified, of which 64 DEGs were significantly
   correlated with the overall survival (OS) of OC patients, and 5 DEGs
   (IGF2, PEG3, DCN, LYPD1 and RARRES1) were applied to build a 5-gene
   signature. Patients in the 5-gene signature low risk group had
   significantly better OS compared with those in the 5-gene high risk
   group (P=0.0004) in the training set. Similar results were found in the
   test set, and the signature was also an independent prognostic factor.
   The prognosis performance of the 5-gene signature was significantly
   better than that of CA-125 and HE4. GSEA suggested that OC samples in
   the 5-gene high risk group were significantly enriched in
   WNT/beta-catenin signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We
   developed and validated a 5-gene signature that might be used as an
   independent prognostic factor in patients with OS.

AB BackgroundThe biological regulatory system is highly dynamic.
   Correlations between functionally related genes change over different
   biological conditions, which are often unobserved in the data. At the
   gene level, the dynamic correlations result in three-way gene
   interactions involving a pair of genes that change correlation, and a
   third gene that reflects the underlying cellular conditions. This type
   of ternary relation can be quantified by the Liquid Association
   statistic. Studying these three-way interactions at the gene triplet
   level have revealed important regulatory mechanisms in the biological
   system. Currently, due to the extremely large amount of possible
   combinations of triplets within a high-throughput gene expression
   dataset, no method is available to examine the ternary relationship at
   the biological system level and formally address the false discovery
   issue.ResultsHere we propose a new method, Hypergraph for Dynamic
   Correlation (HDC), to construct module-level three-way interaction
   networks. The method is able to present integrative uniform hypergraphs
   to reflect the global dynamic correlation pattern in the biological
   system, providing guidance to down-stream gene triplet-level analyses.
   To validate the method's ability, we conducted two real data experiments
   using a melanoma RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
   a yeast cell cycle dataset. The resulting hypergraphs are clearly
   biologically plausible, and suggest novel relations relevant to the
   biological conditions in the data.ConclusionsWe believe the new approach
   provides a valuable alternative method to analyze omics data that can
   extract higher order structures. The software is at
   https://github.com/yunchuankong/HypergraphDynamicCorrelation.

   heterogeneity and interactions of among glioma cells.MethodsHere, we
   firstly analyzed the single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data of 6341 glioma
   cells using manifold learning and identified neoplastic and healthy
   cells infiltrating in tumor microenvironment. We systematically revealed
   cell-to-cell interactions inside gliomas based on corresponding
   scRNA-seq and TCGA RNA-seq data.ResultsA total of 16 significantly
   correlated autocrine ligand-receptor signal pairs inside neoplastic
   cells were identified based on the scRNA-seq and TCGA data of glioma.
   Furthermore, we explored the intercellular communications between cancer
   stem-like cells (CSCs) and macrophages, and identified 66
   ligand-receptor pairs, some of which could significantly affect
   prognostic outcomes. An efficient machine learning model was constructed
   to accurately predict the prognosis of glioma patients based on the
   ligand-receptor interactions.ConclusionCollectively, our study not only
   reveals functionally important cell-to-cell interactions inside glioma,
   but also detects potentially prognostic markers for predicting the
   survival of glioma patients.

AB Background and Objective: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common
   histological type of all lung cancers and is associated with genetic and
   epigenetic aberrations. The tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage is
   the most authoritative indicator of the clinical outcome in LUAD
   patients in current clinical practice. In this study, we attempted to
   identify novel genetic and epigenetic modifications and integrate them
   as a predictor of the prognosis for LUAD, to supplement the TNM stage
   with additional information.
   Methods: A dataset of 445 patients with LUAD was obtained from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas database. Both genetic and epigenetic aberrations
   were screened for their prognostic impact on overall survival (OS). A
   prognostic score (PS) integrating all the candidate prognostic factors
   was then developed and its prognostic value validated.
   Results: A total of two micro-RNAs, two mRNAs and two DNA methylation
   sites were identified as prognostic factors associated with OS. The low-
   and high-risk patient groups, divided by their PS level, showed
   significantly different OS (p < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival
   (RFS; p = 0.005). Patients in the early stages (stages I/II) and
   advanced stages (stages III/IV) of LUAD could be further subdivided by
   PS into four subgroups. PS remained efficient in stratifying patients
   into different OS (p < 0.001) and RFS (p = 0.005) when the low- and
   high-risk subgroups were in the early stages of the disease. However,
   there was only a significant difference in OS (p = 0.04) but not RFS (p
   = 0.2), between the low-risk and high-risk subgroups when both were in
   advanced stages.
   Conclusion: PS, in combination with the TNM stage, provides additional
   precision in stratifying patients with significantly different OS and
   RFS prognoses. Further studies are warranted to assess the efficiency of
   PS and to explain the effects of the genetic and epigenetic aberrations
   observed in LUAD.

TI Assessment of PARP4 as a candidate breast cancer susceptibility gene.

AB PURPOSE: PARP4 has been proposed as a candidate breast cancer
   susceptibility gene. However, its function and involvement in breast
   carcinogenesis is unclear. We sought to determine the variant frequency
   of PARP4 in BRCA-negative women referred for genetic testing from
   Singapore and to perform functional analyses of PARP4.
   METHODS: Next-generation sequencing of PARP4 was conducted for 198
   BRCA-negative cases from Singapore. Three independent case-control
   association analyses of PARP4 were performed for (1) our Singaporean
   cohort, (2) three dbGaP datasets, and (3) cases from TCGA, with controls
   from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). PARP4 knockout cells were
   generated utilizing the CRISPR-Cas9 approach in MDA-MB-231 (breast
   cancer) and MCF10A (normal breast) cell lines, and colony formation,
   cell proliferation, and migration assays carried out.
   RESULTS: Candidate variants in PARP4 were identified in 5.5% (11/198) of
   our Singapore cohort. Case-control association studies for our cases and
   the dbGaP datasets showed no significant association. However, a
   significant association was observed for PARP4 variants when comparing
   988 breast cancer cases from the TCGA provisional data and 53,105
   controls from ExAC (ALL) (OR 0.249, 95% CI 0.139-0.414, P=2.86*10-11).
   PARP4 knockout did not affect the clonogenicity, proliferation rate, and
   migration of normal breast cells, but appeared to decrease the
   proliferation rate and clonogenicity of breast cancer cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results do not support that PARP4
   functions as a cancer susceptibility gene. This study highlights the
   importance of performing functional analyses for candidate cancer
   predisposition genes.

AB Breast cancer (BC) is a common malignant tumour for the adult female and
   its relative incidence has increased continuously in recent years. The
   primary molecular mechanisms of breast tumourigenesis remain unclear.
   With the sequencing technology, we found that coatomer protein complex
   subunit beta 2 (COPB2) gene is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues.
   However, the biological function of COPB2 in BC has yet to be
   determined. This current research demonstrates, significant
   up-regulation of COPB2 in tissues of breast cancer while comparing the
   adjacent normal tissue both invalidated cohort and TCGA cohort.
   Up-regulated expression of COPB2 was correlated with lymph node
   metastasis (LNM) and oestrogen receptor (ER) in the TCGA cohort and a
   high level of COPB2 was associated with age and lymph node metastasis in
   the validated cohort. Besides, logistic analysis illustrated in BC
   patient COPB2 expression, tumour size, age, ER and disease stage were
   independent high-risk factors of LNM. Loss of function experiments
   revealed that down-regulation of COPB2 could inhibit capacities of
   proliferation and cell invasion in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cell lines.
   Moreover, underexpression of COPB2 could decrease the EMT-related
   protein N-cadherin and vimentin which may lead to cell invasion. This
   current research provides new shreds of evidence that COPB2
   overexpression shows significant character in the progression of breast
   cancer. To best of our knowledge, our findings indicated that COPB2 was
   vital oncogene which was associated with breast cancer.

AB Uterine leiomyoma (UL) is the most common benign tumor of the uterus.
   HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) as a lncRNAs is the product of
   HOXC gene that plays a major role in the invasion and development of
   different tumors. Several lines of evidence have been suggested the
   effects of HOTAIR polymorphisms on cancer risk. The aim of the present
   study was to analyze the effects of HOTAIR polymorphisms (rs12826786,
   rs920778, rs4759314 and rs1899663) on UL in southeast of Iran. A total
   of 152 women with UL and 182 age-matched healthy women were selected in
   the case-control study. The PCR-RFLP and ARMS-PCR methods were used for
   genotyping. HOTAIR rs920778 polymorphism was associated with a lower
   risk of UL in dominant [OR, 0.5 (95% CI, 0.3-0.9); P=0.03], recessive
   [OR, 0.6 (95% CI, 0.4-0.9; P=0.016] and allelic models [OR, 0.6(95% CI,
   0.5-0.9); P=0.004]. However, HOTAIR rs12826786 polymorphism was
   associated with a higher risk of UL in dominant [OR, 2.6 (95% CI,
   1.6-4.1); P=0.0001], recessive [OR, 1.9 (95% CI, 1-3.6); P=0.04] and
   allelic models [OR, 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.4); P=0.0003]. There was no
   association between HOTAIR rs4759314 and rs1899663 polymorphisms and UL
   susceptibility. The frequency of CTGA haplotype was lower in UL women;
   however, the CCGA, TCGA, TTTA, and TTGA haplotypes were more frequent in
   UL women. Our results indicated that HOTAIR rs12826786 and rs920778
   polymorphisms had a significant effect on UL susceptibility. The HOTAIR
   haplotypes could affect UL susceptibility.

PD 2019-May-22
PY 2019
AB BACKGROUND: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is associated with the
   development of metastasis in invasive breast cancer (BC). However, the
   complex molecular mechanisms of LVI, which overlap with other oncogenic
   pathways, remain unclear. This study, using available large
   transcriptomic datasets, aims to identify genes associated with LVI in
   early-stage BC patients.
   METHODS: Gene expression data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast
   Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort (n=1565) was used as a
   discovery dataset, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n=854) cohort was
   used as a validation dataset. Key genes were identified on the basis of
   differential mRNA expression with respect to LVI status as characterised
   by histological review. The relationships among LVI-associated genomic
   subtype, clinicopathological features and patient outcomes were
   explored.
   RESULTS: A 99-gene set was identified that demonstrated significantly
   different expression between LVI-positive and LVI-negative cases.
   Clustering analysis with this gene set further divided cases into two
   molecular subtypes (subtypes 1 and 2), which were significantly
   associated with pathology-determined LVI status in both cohorts. The
   10-year overall survival of subtype 2 was significantly worse than that
   of subtype 1.
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that LVI in BC is associated with a
   specific transcriptomic profile with potential prognostic value.

AB The ability to predict responsiveness to drugs in individual patients is
   limited. We hypothesized that integrating molecular information from
   databases would yield predictions that could be experimentally tested to
   develop transcriptomic signatures for specific drugs. We analyzed lung
   adenocarcinoma patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
   identified a subset of patients in which xanthine dehydrogenase
   expression correlated with decreased survival. We tested allopurinol, an
   FDA-approved drug that inhibits xanthine dehydrogenase, on human
   Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines obtained from the Broad
   Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and identified sensitive
   and resistant cell lines. We utilized the transcriptomic profiles of
   these cell lines to identify six-gene signatures for
   allopurinol-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Transcriptomic networks
   identified JAK2 as an additional target in allopurinol-resistant lines.
   Treatment of resistant cell lines with allopurinol and CEP-33779 (a JAK2
   inhibitor) resulted in cell death. The effectiveness of allopurinol
   alone or allopurinol and CEP-33779 were verified in vivo using tumor
   formation in NCR-nude mice. We utilized the six-gene signatures to
   predict five additional allopurinol-sensitive NSCLC cell lines, and four
   allopurinol-resistant cell lines susceptible to combination therapy. We
   searched the transcriptomic data from a library of patient-derived NSCLC
   tumors from Jackson Laboratory to identify tumors that would be
   predicted to be sensitive to allopurinol or allopurinol + CEP-33779
   treatment. Patient-derived tumors showed the predicted drug sensitivity
   in vivo. These data indicate that we can use integrated molecular
   information from cancer databases to predict drug responsiveness in
   individual patients and thus enable precision medicine.

   allow researchers to visually explore these data. In 2015, we built
   MEXPRESS, an online tool for the integration and visualization of gene
   expression, DNA methylation and clinical data from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA), a large collection of publicly available multi-omics
   cancer data. MEXPRESS addresses the need for an easy-to-use, interactive
   application that allows researchers to identify dysregulated genes and
   their clinical relevance in cancer. Furthermore, while other tools
   typically do not support integrated visualization of expression and DNA
   methylation data in combination with the precise genomic location of the
   methylation, MEXPRESS is unique in how it depicts these diverse data
   types together. Motivated by the large number of users MEXPRESS has
   managed to attract over the past 3 years and the recent migration of all
   TCGA data to a new data portal, we developed a new version of MEXPRESS
   (https://mexpress.be). It contains the latest TCGA data, additional
   types of omics and clinical data and extra functionality, allowing users
   to explore mechanisms of gene dysregulation beyond expression and DNA
   methylation.

AB BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major challenge for
   public health worldwide. Considering the great heterogeneity of HCC,
   more accurate prognostic models are urgently needed. To identify a
   robust prognostic gene signature, we conduct this study.Materials and
   methodsLevel 3 mRNA expression profiles and clinicopathological data
   were obtained in The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma
   (TCGA-LIHC). GSE14520 dataset from the gene expression omnibus (GEO)
   database was downloaded to further validate the results in TCGA.
   Differentially expressed mRNAs between HCC and normal tissue were
   investigated. Univariate Cox regression analysis and lasso Cox
   regression model were performed to identify and construct the prognostic
   gene signature. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC),
   Kaplan-Meier curve, multivariate Cox regression analysis, nomogram, and
   decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the prognostic
   capacity of the six-gene signature. The prognostic value of the gene
   signature was further validated in independent GSE14520 cohort. Gene Set
   Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) was performed to further understand the
   underlying molecular mechanisms. The performance of the prognostic
   signature in differentiating between normal liver tissues and HCC were
   also investigated.ResultsA novel six-gene signature (including CSE1L,
   CSTB, MTHFR, DAGLA, MMP10, and GYS2) was established for HCC prognosis
   prediction. The ROC curve showed good performance in survival prediction
   in both the TCGA HCC cohort and the GSE14520 validation cohort. The
   six-gene signature could stratify patients into a high- and low-risk
   group which had significantly different survival. Cox regression
   analysis showed that the six-gene signature could independently predict
   OS. Nomogram including the six-gene signature was established and shown
   some clinical net benefit. Furthermore, GSEA revealed several
   significantly enriched oncological signatures and various metabolic
   process, which might help explain the underlying molecular mechanisms.
   Besides, the prognostic signature showed a strong ability for
   differentiating HCC from normal tissues.ConclusionsOur study established
   a novel six-gene signature and nomogram to predict overall survival of
   HCC, which may help in clinical decision making for individual
   treatment.

AB ObjectiveOur aim is to analyzed the expression pattern of sirtuin(SIRT)
   superfamily and evaluated their prognostic values in serous ovarian
   cancer patients.MethodsWe first analyzed the differential expression of
   SIRT members among fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), primary serous
   ovarian cancers/tubal cancers (PSOCs/PSTCs), and omental metastases
   using GSE10971 and GSE30587 datasets. The prognostic values of SIRT
   members were evaluated using TCGA and GSE9891 dataset.ResultsSIRT3 and
   SIRT5 expression were significantly decreased and increased in
   PSOCs/PSTCs compared with that in normal counterparts, respectively.
   SIRT6 and SIRT7 were overexpressed in ometal metastases compared with
   corresponding primary counterparts. With respect to recurrence free
   survival, however, SIRT7 overexpression was correlated with better
   prognosis. A similar trend was observed by multivariable analysis.
   Regarding overall survival (OS), increased expression of SIRT3, SIRT5,
   and SIRT7 were associated with better survival by univariable analysis.
   Subsequent multivariable analysis showed that SIRT3 remained an
   independent favorable prognostic factor for OS. The SIRT3-related
   nomogram illustrated age at initial diagnosis as sharing the largest
   contribution to OS, followed by SIRT3 expression and FIGO stage. The
   C-index for OS prediction was 0.65 (95%CI, 0.61-0.69) in training cohort
   (TCGA dataset) and 0.65 (95%CI, 0.59-0.71) in validation cohort (GSE9891
   dataset), respectively. The calibration plots showed optimal agreement
   between the prediction by SIRT3-related nomogram and actual observation
   for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS probability.ConclusionIn conclusion, SIRT3 was
   an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS in serous ovarian
   cancer, and added prognostic value to the traditional
   clinicopathological factors used to evaluate patients' prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas (LGG) are known to progress to
   glioblastoma (GBM) whilst the chance of survival decreases. The
   TNF-receptor CD40 and its ligand CD40L have shown first value as
   biomarkers regarding GBM. The present study evaluates the role of
   CD40/CD40L in LGG and GBM differentiating IDH-wild-type and IDH-mutant
   GBM.
   METHODS: This study is based on patient-derived samples (74 grade II
   gliomas, 36 grade III gliomas, and 40 GBM) and expression analysis
   through real-time PCR. Open-access TCGA-data were used to run analysis
   on mRNA-expression as validation dataset and the strong cohorts of the
   TCGA datasets "Brain Lower Grade Glioma" and "Glioblastoma".
   RESULTS: We could show that patients with LGG and CD40 overexpression
   present shorter progression-free (43 vs. 29 months, Hazard Ratio 0.5715,
   p=0.0262) and overall survival (116 vs. 54 months, Hazard Ratio 0.3431,
   p<0.0001). Consistently, relapsed grade II gliomas show higher CD40
   expression compared to primary grade II gliomas (p=0.0028). As in LGG,
   CD40 was a negative marker for overall survival in GBM (12 vs. 10
   months, Hazard Ratio 0.5178, p=0.0491). In this context, we could show a
   higher CD40 expression in IDH-wild-type GBM compared to IDH-mutant GBM.
   The data obtained from the TCGA supported our findings with similar
   results for PFS and OS in LGG and GBM. CD40L showed no correlation with
   survival data.
   CONCLUSION: High expression of CD40 shows significant correlation with
   poor outcome in both LGG and GBM, and is overexpressed in IDH-wild-type
   GBM.

AB The identification of the cancer driver genes is essential for
   personalized therapy. The mutation frequency of most driver genes is in
   the middle (2-20%) or even lower range, which makes it difficult to find
   the driver genes with low-frequency mutations. Other forms of genomic
   aberrations, such as copy number variations (CNVs) and epigenetic
   changes, may also reflect cancer progression. In this work, a method for
   identifying the potential cancer driver genes (iPDG) based on molecular
   data integration is proposed. DNA copy number variation, somatic
   mutation, and gene expression data of matched cancer samples are
   integrated. In combination with the method of iKEEG, the "key genes" of
   cancer are identified, and the change in their expression levels is used
   for auxiliary evaluation of whether the mutated genes are potential
   drivers. For a mutated gene, the concept of mutational effect is
   defined, which takes into account the effects of copy number variation,
   mutation gene itself, and its neighbor genes. The method mainly includes
   two steps: the first step is data preprocessing. First, DNA copy number
   variation and somatic mutation data are integrated. Then, the integrated
   data are mapped to a given interaction network, and the diffusion kernel
   is used to form the mutation effect matrix. The second step is to obtain
   the key genes by using the iKGGE method, and construct the connection
   matrix by means of the gene expression data of the key genes and
   mutation impact matrix of the mutated genes. Experiments on TCGA breast
   cancer and Glioblastoma multiforme datasets demonstrate that iPDG is
   effective not only to identify the known cancer driver genes but also to
   discover the rare potential driver genes. When measured by functional
   enrichment analysis, we find that these genes are clearly associated
   with these two types of cancers.

AB BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease in
   terms of genetic basis, clinical, biological and prognostic, and is a
   malignant clonal disease of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Nearly half of
   adult AML patients exhibit a cytogenetic normal acute myeloid leukemia
   (CN-AML). The expression level of NCALD gene was associated with the
   prognosis of ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
   expression level of NCALD gene is still unclear in the prognosis of
   patients with AML.MethodWe integrated 5 independent datasets totally 665
   AML patients (497 CN-AML patients) to analyzed relation between NCALD
   gene expression and the clinical FAB classification, gene mutation,
   therapy, prognosis of CN-AML. We analyzed the NCALD gene expression with
   the prognosis and LSC of 165 AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) dataset and 78 AML patients from GEO dataset.ResultsHigh
   NCALD-expressing CN-AML patients were associated with poor event-free
   survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to low NCALD
   expression (EFS, P<0.0001, OS, P<0.0001). In AML patients of allogeneic
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), high NCALD
   expression was associated with poor survival prognosis in EFS and OS
   (EFS, P<0.0051, OS, P=0.028). Post-chemotherapy in AML patients, high
   NCALD expression led a worse prognosis in EFS and OS (EFS, P=0.011; OS,
   P=0.0056). In multivariate analysis, high NCALD expression was an
   independent prognostic factor that predicts shorter EFS and OS (EFS,
   P=3.84E-05, OS, P=8.53E-05) of CN-AML.ConclusionOur results indicate
   that high expression of NCALD gene is a poor prognostic factor for
   CN-AML. NCALD can be considered as independent predictors of CN-AML
   patients and can be used as a biomarker for the prognosis of CN-AML.

AB BackgroundEndometrial cancer (EC) is one of the female malignant tumors.
   Endometrial cancer predominately affects post-menopausal women.
   Bioinformatics analysis has been widely applied to screen and analyze
   genes in linkage to various types of cancer progression.MethodsDownload
   the gene expression profile from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
   Calculate raw expression data according to pre-processing procedures. We
   performed the limma R language package to screen DEGs between
   Endometrial cancer tissue samples and normal uterus tissue samples.
   Enrichment of the functions and pathways was analyzed by using
   clusterprofiler. We utilized Search Tool for the Retrieval of
   Interacting Genes Database (STRING) to assess protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) information, and then we used plug-in Molecular
   Complex Detection (MCODE) to screen hub modules of PPI network in
   Cytoscape. We also performed functional analysis on the genes in the hub
   module by using clusterprofiler. Next, we utilized the WGCNA package in
   R to establish co-expression network for the DEGs. The Venn diagram was
   performed to overlap the gene in key module and hub PPI cluster. We
   validated the key genes in TCGA, GEPIA, UALCAN and Immunohistochemistry
   staining obtained from The Human Protein Atlas database. And then we did
   ROC curve analysis by SPSS. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and
   mutation analysis were also performed for hub genes.ResultsFunctional
   and pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the upregulated
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in
   CXCR chemokine receptor binding, chemokine activity, chemokine receptor
   binding, G-protein coupled receptor binding, RAGE receptor binding,
   cytokine activity, microtubule binding, receptor regulator activity and
   microtubule motor activity, and the down-regulated genes were highly
   enriched in collagen binding. After using STRING software to construct
   PPI network, 30 prominent proteins were identified and the first two
   significant modules were selected. In co-expression network, 5
   EC-related modules were identified. Among them, the turquoise module has
   the highest correlation with the EC. We further analyzed the genes in
   the PPI and turquoise module, and selected eleven key genes related to
   EC after validation of TCGA database, GEPIA, UALCAN and
   immunohistochemistry. Six of them had mutation
   significance.ConclusionsIn summary, these 11 genes may become new
   therapy targets for EC treatment.

AB The treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) is largely surgical followed
   by adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk cases. In patients with stage II
   cancer, there is no clear benefit for chemotherapy and the current tools
   for assessment of risk are inadequate. A recent study identified that
   CRC with a gene signature similar to undifferentiated colonic stem cells
   was associated with a worse outcome. It was later shown that loss of
   CDX2 detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) alone resulted in a worse
   prognosis and that this could be utilized to predict patients that would
   benefit from chemotherapy. Having observed that CDX2 expression can be
   patchy, we elected to validate these prior results for clinical practice
   using whole-slide immunohistochemistry. The pathology of all cases was
   reviewed, and three blocks were selected for CDX2 IHC. We also expanded
   the panel beyond CDX2 to assess whether other markers in the gene
   signature including CDX1, Muc2, GPX2 and villin could better predict
   outcome. Among 210 cases, CDX2 expression was diffusely lost in 11% and
   focally lost in 23% of cases. There was no difference in survival based
   on CDX2 expression but Muc2 loss was associated with reduced survival
   (HR: 3.32; 95% CI 1.20-9.20). No significant differences in outcome were
   identified based on CDX1, GPX2 or villin expression. In keeping with
   this, assessment of TCGA gene expression data demonstrated that
   decreased Muc2 expression was associated with reduced overall survival.
   Our results with whole slide IHC are different from the previous studies
   and caution against the use of CDX2 in isolation as a prognostic marker
   in clinical practice. We have identified that loss of Muc2, is
   associated with reduced survival. This supports the use of the colonic
   differentiation gene expression signature to identify high-risk patients
   but cautions against the use of any one immunohistochemistry-based
   marker in isolation.

AB BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a malignant tumor disease with high morbidity
   and high mortality. The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most
   common type, among them, lung squamous cell carcinoma own special
   pathological type and specific treatment, is a subtype of non-small cell
   lung cancer and can be divided into peripheral type and central type
   according to clinical phenotype. This study explores the differences in
   gene levels and their potential values based on clinical differences
   between central and peripheral in lung squamous cell carcinoma.
   METHODS: The lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset was collected from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, clinical information and the
   corresponding gene expression profiles were downloaded. Then we further
   sort and analyze all these data.
   RESULTS: In clinical characteristics analysis, result showed that
   central lung squamous cell carcinoma was more likely to metastasis with
   lymph node than peripheral lung squamous cell carcinoma (46.2%, 67/145
   vs 28.9%, 26/90; P=0.019), while there were no significant differences
   in gender, age, tumor size, distant metastasis, tumor node metastasis
   (TNM) stage, and EGFR mutation. Gene expression analysis showed 1,031
   differentially expressed genes between central and peripheral lung
   squamous cell carcinoma, of which 629 genes were up-regulated and 402
   genes were down-regulated (peripheral vs central). Further enrichment
   analysis showed differentially expressed genes were mainly riched in 6
   signaling pathways. Among them, the neuroactive ligand-receptor
   interaction pathway was the main enrichment pathway of differentially
   expressed genes, and other differential expressed genes were mainly
   involved in lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism. The analysis of
   interaction network showed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox A
   (HNF1A) and cytochrome p450 family, Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) own
   widely effect in up-regulated genes, while ALB and APOA1 at the key
   positions of the network in down-regulated genes were CONCLUSIONS:
   Central and peripheral lung squamous cell carcinoma showed clinical
   phenotype difference not only reflected in the incidence of lymph node
   metastasis, but also in gene expression profiles. Among them, HNF1A,
   CYP3A4, ALB, APOA1 at the key position of the differential gene

AB PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to research the effect of miR-202 on
   breast cancer cells proliferation, invasion, and migration.
   METHODS: TCGA analysis was used to research miR-202 expression and
   overall survival in patients with breast cancer. Transfection with
   miR-202 mimics or cotransfection with miR-202 mimics and ROCK1
   expression vector was performed on breast cancer cells. Reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the miR-202
   expression of breast cancer tissues and cells. Western blot was
   conducted to research the expression of ROCK1, E-cadherin, Twist,
   N-cadherin, and MMP2. Dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to
   detect the targeted relationship between ROCK1 and miR-202. MTT and
   transwell assay were used to detect breast cancer cells proliferation,
   invasion, and migration.
   RESULTS: Downregulation of miR-202 was positively correlated with poor
   prognosis of patients withbreast cancer. miR-202 in breast cancer
   tissues and breast cancer cells was significantly downregulated.
   Upregulation of miR-202 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and
   invasion of breast cancer cells. miR-202 promoted E-cadherin expression
   and inhibited the expression of N-cadherin, Twist, and MMP2. ROCK1 was
   the target gene of miR-202. miR-202 regulated proliferation, migration,
   invasion, and expression of related proteins in breast cancer cells by
   targeting ROCK1 expression.
   CONCLUSIONS: miR-202 inhibited breast cancer cells proliferation,
   invasion, and migration by targeting the ROCK1 gene.

AB Background: The microRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated as prognostic
   markers in many cancers. The aim of this study was to identify new miRNA
   prognostic biomarkers in endometrial cancer (EC) and to develop an
   expression-based miRNA signature to provide survival risk prediction for
   EC patients.
   Methods: From TCGA database, the miRNA datasets of EC and clinical
   information were downloaded in April 2018. Using univariate and
   multivariate Cox regression analyses identify prognostic factors. Using
   area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curve assess the sensitivity and specificity of prognostic model.
   Results: 530 patients were randomly divided into training set and
   testing set. Among 561 differentially expressed miRNAs, 4 miRNAs
   (miR-4758, miR-876, miR-142, miR-190b) were demonstrated to be
   predictive biomarkers of overall survival (OS) for EC patients in
   training set. Based on the risk score of 4-miRNA model, patients in the
   training set were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups with
   significantly different OS. This 4-miRNA model was validated in testing
   and entire set. The AUC for the ROC curves in the entire set was 0.704.
   Meanwhile, multivariate Cox regression combined with other traditional
   clinical parameters indicated that the 4-miRNA model can be used as an
   independent OS prognostic factor. Functional enrichment analysis
   revealed that these miRNAs are involved in biological processes and
   pathways that are closely related to cancer.
   Conclusion: A robust 4-miRNA signature as an independent prognostic
   factor for OS in EC patients was established.

AB Background and objective: High-throughput Next Generation Sequencing
   tools have generated immense quantity of genome-wide methylation and
   expression profiling data, resulting in an unprecedented opportunity to
   unravel the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying cancer.
   Identifying differentially methylated regions within gene networks is an
   important step towards revealing the cancer epigenome blueprint.
   Approaches that integrate gene methylation and expression profiles
   assume their negative correlation and build a single scaffold network to
   cluster. However, the exact regulatory mechanism between gene expression
   and methylation is not precisely deciphered.
   Methods: A consensus-based clustering framework, namely, Differentially
   Methylated Gene Communities based on Multi-network (DMGC-M) is proposed,
   that takes multiple gene networks as input and builds a community
   structure out of evidences from all network types.
   Results: Experiments on six cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) reveal that multi-network approaches produce more discriminative
   gene communities than integrated approaches.
   Conclusion: The proposed method will be useful to a number of
   researchers who seek to identify epigenetic dysregulations in pathways
   or molecular networks. The findings can also advance recent research
   efforts in Molecular Pathologic Epidemiology.

AB Background: Serum ferritin is a useful tumor marker for renal cell
   carcinoma (RCC). However, the expression of ferritin heavy chain (FTH1),
   the main subunit of ferritin, is unclear in primary RCC tissues. In this
   study, we investigated FTH1 mRNA expression and its diagnostic and
   prognostic value in RCC.
   Material/Methods: The mRNA expression of FTH1 was analyzed using
   including Oncomine, Gene Expression Omnibus, and Cancer Genome Atlas
   datasets, while the protein level of FTH1 was analyzed using the Human
   Protein Atlas database. The associations between FTH1 and
   clinicopathologic characteristics and survival time and Cox multivariate
   survival analysis were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 software. A
   meta-analysis was performed to assess consistency of FTH1 expression.
   GO, KEGG, and PPI analyses were used to predict biological functions.
   Results: According to TCGA data, overexpression of FTH1 was detected in
   890 RCC tissues (15.2904 +/- 0.63157) compared to 129 normal kidney
   tissues (14.4502 +/- 0.51523, p< 0.001). Among the clinicopathological
   characteristics evaluated, patients with increased pathologic T staging,
   lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis were significantly
   associated with higher expression of FTH1. Elevated FTH1 mRNA levels
   were correlated with worse prognosis of RCC patients. Cox multivariate
   survival analysis indicated that age, stage, and M stage were predictors
   of poor prognosis in patients with RCC.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that FTH1 expression is an effective
   prognostic and diagnosis biomarker for RCC.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to identify gene signals for
   lower-grade glioma (LGG) and to assess their potential as recurrence
   biomarkers.
   Material/Methods: An LGG-related mRNA sequencing dataset was downloaded
   from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Informix. Multiple bioinformatics
   analysis methods were used to identify key genes and potential molecular
   mechanisms in recurrence of LGG.
   Results: A total of 326 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs), were
   identified from 511 primary LGG tumor and 18 recurrent samples. Gene
   ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the DEGs were implicated in cell
   differentiation, neuron differentiation, negative regulation of neuron
   differentiation, and cell proliferation in the forebrain. The Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database suggests that DEGs are
   associated with proteoglycans in cancer, the Wnt signaling pathway,
   ECM-receptor interaction, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,
   transcriptional deregulation in cancer, and the Hippo signaling pathway.
   The hub DEGs in the protein-protein interaction network are
   apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2), collagen type III alpha 1 chain (COL3A1),
   collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), tyrosinase (TYR), collagen type
   I alpha 2 chain (COL1A2), neurotensin (NTS), collagen type V alpha 1
   chain (COL5A1), poly(A) polymerase beta (PAPOLB), insulin-like growth
   factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), and anomalous homeobox
   (ANHX). GSEA revealed that the following biological processes may
   associated with LGG recurrence: cell cycle, DNA replication and repair,
   regulation of apoptosis, neuronal differentiation, and Wnt signaling
   pathway.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that hub DEGs may assist in the
   molecular understanding of LGG recurrence. These findings still need
   further molecular studies to identify the assignment of DEGs in LGG.

AB In the present study, we aimed to identify specific lncRNAs and miRNAs,
   as well as mRNAs, involved in bile duct carcinoma (BDC) and to further
   explore the way in which lncRNA UCA1 regulates cell metastasis ability.
   Differentially expressed RNAs were screened out from the TCGA database.
   In in vitro experiments, qRT-PCR was used to measure lncRNA UCA1,
   miR-122 and CLIC1 expression. We performed a dual luciferase assay to
   validate the target relationships among UCA1, CLIC1 and miR-122. The
   cell migration ability was measured by a wound healing assay, and
   Transwell assays were applied to detect cell invasive ability. Western
   blot analysis was employed to detect the expression of related proteins
   in the MAPK signaling pathway. According to the bioinformatics analysis,
   lncRNA UCA1 and CLIC1 were both significantly upregulated in BDC, while
   the expression of miR-122 declined compared with the normal group. The
   target relationship among UCA1, CLIC1 and miR-122 was verified. UCA1
   promoted BDC cell migration and invasiveness, while miR-122 inhibited
   their progression. CLIC1 served as the downstream target gene of miR-122
   and had opposite effects. The ERK/MAPK signaling pathway was activated

AB Background: Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), natural plant compounds,
   have recently emerged as a promising strategy for cancer treatment, but
   little is known concerning their effects on breast cancer (BC)
   tumorigenesis.
   Methods: We obtained breast cancer genetic data from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) database, network pharmacology to further clarify its
   biological properties. Survival analysis and molecular docking
   techniques were implemented for the final screening to obtain key target
   information. Our experiments focused on the detection of intervention
   effects of APS on BC cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), and quantitative
   RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess the expression of key targets.
   Results: A total of 1,439 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
   identified by TCGA and used to build disease networks. Module analysis,
   gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed characteristic of the DEGs
   network. Topological properties were used to identify key targets,
   survival analysis and molecular docking finally found that the targets
   of APS regulation of BC cells may be CCNB1, CDC6, and p53. Through cell
   viability, migration and invasion assays, we found that APS interferes
   with the development of breast cancer in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a
   dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, qRT-PCR verification suggested that
   the expression of CCNB1 and CDC6 in breast cancer cells was
   significantly downregulated in response to APS, while expression of the
   tumor suppressor gene P53 was significantly increased.
   Conclusion: Results of this study suggest therapeutic potential for APS
   in BC treatment, possibly through interventions with CCNB1, CDC6, and
   P53. Furthermore, these findings illustrate the feasibility of using
   network pharmacology to connect large-scale target data as a way to
   discover the mechanism of natural products interfering with disease.

AB Emerging evidence has highlighted the important role of abnormal lipid
   accumulation in cancer development and progression, but the mechanism
   for this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, it is demonstrated that
   phospholipase C-like 1/uncoupling protein 1 (PLCL1)/(UCP1)-mediated
   lipid browning promotes tumor cell "slimming" and represses tumor
   progression. By screening three independent lipid metabolism-related
   gene sets in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and analyzing the
   TCGA database, it is found that PLCL1 predicted a poor prognosis and was
   downregulated in ccRCC. Restoration of PLCL1 expression in ccRCC cells
   significantly represses tumor progression and reduces abnormal lipid
   accumulation. Additionally, a phenomenon called tumor cell "slimming,"
   in which tumor cell volume is reduced and lipid droplets are transformed
   into tiny pieces, is observed. Further studies show that PLCL1 promotes
   tumor cell "slimming" and represses tumor progression through
   UCP1-mediated lipid browning, which consumes lipids without producing
   ATP energy. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that PLCL1 improves
   the protein stability of UCP1 by influencing the level of protein
   ubiquitination. Collectively, the data indicate that lipid browning
   mediated by PLCL1/UCP1 promotes tumor cell "slimming" and consumes
   abnormal lipid accumulation, which represses the progression of ccRCC.
   Tumor cell "slimming" offers a promising new concept and treatment
   modality against tumor development and progression.

AB PurposeTo explore imaging biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis and
   prediction of pathologic stage in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
   using multiple machine learning algorithms based on CT image feature
   analysis.MethodsPatients with stage IA to IV NSCLC were included, and
   the whole dataset was divided into training and testing sets and an
   external validation set. To tackle imbalanced datasets in NSCLC, we
   generated a new dataset and achieved equilibrium of class distribution
   by using SMOTE algorithm. The datasets were randomly split up into a
   training/testing set. We calculated the importance value of CT image
   features by means of mean decrease gini impurity generated by random
   forest algorithm and selected optimal features according to feature
   importance (mean decrease gini impurity >0.005). The performance of
   prediction model in training and testing sets were evaluated from the
   perspectives of classification accuracy, average precision (AP) score
   and precision-recall curve. The predictive accuracy of the model was
   externally validated using lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous
   cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples from TCGA database.ResultsThe prediction
   model that incorporated nine image features exhibited a high
   classification accuracy, precision and recall scores in the training and
   testing sets. In the external validation, the predictive accuracy of the
   model in LUAD outperformed that in LUSC.ConclusionsThe pathologic stage
   of patients with NSCLC can be accurately predicted based on CT image
   features, especially for LUAD. Our findings extend the application of
   machine learning algorithms in CT image feature prediction for
   pathologic staging and identify potential imaging biomarkers that can be
   used for diagnosis of pathologic stage in NSCLC patients.

AB Utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and KM plotter databases we
   identified six heat shock proteins associated with survival of breast
   cancer patients. The survival curves of samples with high and low
   expression of heat shock genes were compared by log-rank test
   (Mantel-Haenszel). Interestingly, patients overexpressing two identified
   HSPs - HSPA2 and DNAJC20 exhibited longer survival, whereas
   overexpression of other four HSPs - HSP90AA1, CCT1, CCT2, CCT6A resulted
   in unfavorable prognosis for breast cancer patients. We explored
   correlations between expression level of HSPs and clinicopathological
   features including tumor grade, tumor size, number of lymph nodes
   involved and hormone receptor status. Additionally, we identified a
   novel signature with the potential to serve as a prognostic model for
   breast cancer. Using univariate Cox regression analysis followed by
   multivariate Cox regression analysis, we built a risk score formula
   comprising prognostic HSPs (HSPA2, DNAJC20, HSP90AA1, CCT1, CCT2) and
   tumor stage to identify high-risk and low-risk cases. Finally, we
   analyzed the association of six prognostic HSP expression with survival
   of patients suffering from other types of cancer than breast cancer. We
   revealed that depending on cancer type, each of the six analyzed HSPs
   can act both as a positive, as well as a negative regulator of cancer
   development. Our study demonstrates a novel HSP signature for the
   outcome prediction of breast cancer patients and provides a new insight
   into ambiguous role of these proteins in cancer development.

PD 2019-May-17
PY 2019
AB MOTIVATION: Tumor purity (TP) is the proportion of cancer cells in a
   tumor sample. TP impacts on the accurate assessment of molecular and
   genomics features as assayed with NGS approaches. State-of-the-art tools
   mainly rely on somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA) to quantify TP and
   therefore fail when a tumor genome is nearly euploid, i.e.
   "non-aberrant" in terms of identifiable SCNAs.
   RESULTS: We introduce a computational method, Tumor Purity Estimation
   from SNVs (TPES), which derives TP from the allelic fraction
   distribution of SNVs. On more than 7,800 whole-exome sequencing data of
   TCGA tumor samples, it showed high concordance with a range of TP tools
   (Spearman's correlation between 0.68 and 0.82; > 9 SNVs) and rescued TP
   estimates of 1,194 samples (15%) pan-cancer.
   AVAILABILITY: TPES is available as an R package on CRAN and at
   https://bitbucket.org/l0ka/tpes.git.
   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at

AB Most genes are alternatively spliced and increasing number of evidences
   show that alternative splicing (AS) is modified and related to tumor
   progression. Systematic profiles of AS signature in hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) is absent and urgently needed. Here, differentially
   spliced AS transcripts between HCC and non-HCC tissues were compared,
   prognosis-associated AS events by using univariate Cox regression
   analysis were selected. Our gene functional enrichment analysis
   demonstrated the potential pathways enriched by survival-associated AS.
   Prognostic AS signatures were then constructed for HCC prognosis
   prediction by Lasso regression model. We also analyzed splicing factors
   (SFs) regulating underlying mechanisms by Pearson correlation and then
   built corresponding regulatory networks. In addition, we explored the
   performance of AS signature in the mutated HCC samples. Genome-wide AS
   events in 377 HCC patients from TCGA were profiled. Among 34 163 AS
   events in 8985 genes, 3950 AS events in 2403 genes associated with
   overall survival (OS) significantly for HCC were detected. In addition,
   computational algorithm results showed that metabolic and ribosome
   pathways may be the potential molecular mechanisms regulating the poor
   prognosis. More importantly, survival-associated AS signatures revealed
   high performance in predicting HCC prognosis. The area under curve for
   AS signature was 0.806 in all HCC and 0.944 in TP53 mutated HCC samples
   at 2000 days of OS. We submitted prognostic SFs to build the AS
   regulatory network, from which we found prognostic AS events were
   significantly enriched in metabolism-related pathways. A robust AS
   signature for HCC patients and revealed the regulatory splicing networks
   contributing to the potential significantly enriched metabolism-related
   pathways.

AB BACKGROUND: Genomic analysis is the promising tool to clear
   understanding of the tumorigenesis and guide molecular classification
   for pancreatic cancer. Our purpose was to develop a critical predictive
   model for prognosis in pancreatic carcinoma, based on the genomic data.
   METHODS: The online The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International
   Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) datasets were queried as training and
   validation cohorts for comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. We applied
   Lasso and multivariate Cox regression to shrink genes and construct
   predictive model.
   RESULTS: A four genes model (DNAH10: HR=0.71, 95% CI=0.57-0.88, HSBP1L1:
   HR=1.51, 95% CI=1.18-1.92, KIAA0513: HR=0.69, 95% CI=0.50-0.96, and
   MRPL3: HR=3.73, 95% CI=2.03-6.86), was proposed and validated. The
   C-index was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.7-0.77). Patients in high-risk and low-risk
   group, stratified by model, suffered significantly different overall
   survival time (15.1 vs. 49.3months, p<0.0001 in TCGA; 423 vs. 618days,
   p=0.038 in ICGC). Taken clinical parameters into consideration, the
   risk-score was independent marker in clinical subpopulation. To explore
   the molecular mechanisms, 579 differential expression genes (DEG) in two
   groups were identified by edgeR. Functional enrichment of DEG indicated
   neuro-endocrine activity was the potential mechanism for the discrepant
   prognosis.
   CONCLUSION: A specific four genes signature with the ability to
   predicted survival of pancreatic carcinoma was generated, which may
   indicate the connection between neuro-endocrine activity and patients'
   prognosis.

AB Background: The survival and therapeutic outcome vary greatly among
   glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Treatment resistance, including resistance
   to temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy, is a great obstacle for these
   therapies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the predictive value of
   SEC61G on survival and therapeutic response in GBM patients.
   Material/Methods: Survival analyses were performed to assess the
   correlation between SEC61G expression and survival of GBM patients from
   the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas
   (CGGA) datasets. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard
   regression analysis was introduced to determine prognostic factors with
   independent impact power. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene
   set variation analysis (GSVA) were conducted to illustrate possible
   biological functions of SEC61G.
   Results: High expression of SEC61G was significantly correlated with
   poor prognosis in all GBM patients. High expression of SEC61G was also
   associated with poor outcome in those who received TMZ treatment or
   radiotherapy in TCGA GBM cohort. Univariate and multivariate Cox
   proportional hazards regression demonstrated that SEC61G was an
   independent prognostic factor affecting the prognosis and therapeutic
   outcome. The combination of age, SEC61G expression, and MGMT promoter
   methylation in survival analysis could provide better outcome
   assessment. Finally, a strong correlation between SEC61G expression and
   Notch pathway was observed in GSEA and GSVA, which suggested a possible
   mechanism that SEC61G affected survival and TMZ resistance.
   Conclusions: SEC61G expression may be a potential prognostic marker of
   poor survival, and a predictor of poor outcome to TMZ treatment and
   radiotherapy in GBM patients.

AB A defective homologous recombination (HR) repair program increases tumor
   incidence as well as providing a survival advantage in patients with
   breast and ovarian cancers. Here we hypothesize that the tumor-promoting
   side of genome maintenance programs may be contributed by a self-renewal
   protein, nucleostemin (NS). To address this issue, we established its
   functional importance in mammary tumor progression in mice and showed
   that mammary tumor cells become highly susceptible to replicative DNA
   damage following NS depletion and are protected from hydroxyurea-induced
   damage by NS overexpression. Breast cancer cells with basal-like
   characters display more reliance on NS for genome maintenance than those
   with luminal characters. Mechanistically, NS-deficient cells demonstrate
   a significantly reduced HR repair activity. TCGA analyses of human
   breast cancers revealed that NS is co-enriched positively with HR repair
   proteins and that high NS expression correlates with low HR defects and
   predicts poor progression-free survival and resistance to knockdown of
   cell-cycle checkpoint genes in triple-negative/basal-like breast
   cancers. This work indicates that NS constitutes a tumor-promoting
   genome maintenance program required for mammary tumor progression.

   promising approach to find new targets for cancer therapy. In this
   context, through analysis of GSE datasets (GSE3189 and GSE112509),
   stress induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) was found to be overexpressed in
   melanoma tissues compared to benign skin nevi and normal skin tissues,
   respectively. High expression of STIP1 protein was further confirmed in
   our melanoma specimens. The survival data of skin cutaneous melanoma in
   TCGA database indicated that high STIP1 level predicted poor clinical
   outcomes of patients. Functionally, STIP1 knockdown significantly
   inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced
   apoptosis of A2058 cells in vitro. Additionally, STIP1 silencing
   prominently reduced lung metastasis of melanoma cells in vivo. Whereas,
   STIP1 overexpression facilitated the growth and metastasis of M14 cells.
   Intriguingly, STIP1 overexpression markedly increased Janus kinase 2
   (JAK2) expression and activated JAK2/signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in M14 cells, while knockdown of STIP1
   blocked JAK2/STAT3 pathway in A2058 cells. Importantly, JAK2 knockdown
   reversed STIP1-induced melanoma cell proliferation, migration and
   invasion. Thus, we revealed a novel mechanism underlying STIP1-induced
   melanoma progression by regulating JAK2/STAT3 pathway. This study might
   provide a new insight to understand the pathogenesis of melanoma and
   possibly contributed to development of therapeutic approaches for
   melanoma.

AB Lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha factor (LITAF),
   also called p53-induced gene 7 (PIG7), was identified as a transcription
   factor that activates transcription of proinflammatory cytokines in
   macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Previous studies
   have identified LITAF as a potential tumor suppressor in several
   neoplasms, including prostate cancer, B-NHL, acute myeloid leukemia, and
   pancreatic cancer. However, the expression and function of LITAF in
   human glioma remain unexplained. The present study aimed to analyze the
   regulation of LITAF in gliomas. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database revealed that LITAF mRNA expression in glioma tissues was
   higher than that in normal brain tissues, and lower LITAF expression in
   gliomas showed a good prognosis in patients who received radiotherapy,
   by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In our collected specimens, however, LITAF
   showed low expression in glioma tissues compared to that in the normal
   brain tissue. Proliferation and apoptosis of glioma cells were not
   affected by knockdown or overexpression of LITAF in glioma U251, U373,
   and U87cells, but LITAF was able to enhance the radiosensitivity of
   glioma cells. Furthermore, we found that LITAF enhanced radiosensitivity
   via FoxO1 and its specific downstream targets BIM, TRAIL, and FASLG.
   Taken together, our present results demonstrate that LITAF expression is
   decreased in glioma tissues and might enhance radiosensitivity of glioma
   cells via upregulation of the FoxO1 pathway.

AB Objective: To construct ceRNA network and identify pivotal competing
   endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) using ceRNA
   network analysis.
   Methods: The RNA sequencing expression data of 77 ACCs in TCGA were
   obtained from GEPIA. Cancer specific ceRNAs, cancer specific microRNAs
   (miRNAs), and cancer specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified.
   The interaction of cancer specific miRNAs with cancer specific ceRNAs
   and cancer specific mRNAs were predicted. CeRNA network was constructed
   and visualized by Cytoscape 3.7.0 software. The genes in ceRNA network
   regulated GO terms and regulated pathways were performed by function
   analysis. Survival analysis of pivotal ceRNAs was performed for the
   pivotal lncRNAs.
   Result: Twenty-eight cancer specific ceRNAs, 149 cancer specific miRNAs,
   and 104 mRNAs were identified. CeRNA network was constructed including
   10 ceRNAs, 35 miRNAs, and 34 mRNAs. The genes in ceRNA network regulated
   GO terms and were classified into three groups: cellular component (CC),
   molecular function (MF), and biological process (BP). The genes in ceRNA
   network regulated the following pathways: leukocyte transendothelial
   migration, and proteoglycans in cancer. Survival analysis showed that
   CTB-63M22.1 and RP1-241P17.4 were significantly associated with ACC
   patient disease free survival and overall survival.
   Conclusion: This study has constructed ceRNA networks in ACC. The study
   provides a set of pivotal ceRNAs for future investigation into the
   molecular mechanisms.

AB Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is among the most aggressive
   histologic subtypes of kidney cancer, representing about 3% of all human
   cancers. Patients at stage IV have nearly 60% of mortality in 2-3 years
   after diagnosis. To date, most ccRCC studies have used DNA microarrays
   and targeted sequencing of a small set of well-established, commonly
   altered genes. An exception is the large multi-omics study of The Cancer
   Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC), which
   identified new ccRCC genes based on whole exome-sequencing (WES) data,
   and molecular prognostic signatures based on transcriptomics,
   epigenetics and proteomics data. Applying WES to simultaneously
   interrogate virtually all exons in the human genome for somatic
   variation, here we analyzed the burden of coding somatic mutations in
   metastatic ccRCC primary tumors, and its association with patient
   mortality from cancer, in patients who received VEGF receptor-targeting
   drugs as the first-line therapy. To this end, we sequenced the exomes of
   ten tumor-normal pairs of ccRCC patient tissues from primary biopsies at
   > 100x mean depth and called somatic coding variation. Mutation burden
   analysis prioritized 138 genes linked to patient mortality. A gene set
   enrichment analysis evidenced strong statistical support for the
   abundance of genes involved in the development of kidney cancer (p =
   2.31 x 10(-9)) and carcinoma (p = 1.22 x 10(-5)), with 49 genes having
   direct links with kidney cancer according to the published records. Two
   of these genes, SIPA1L2 and EIF3A, demonstrated independent associations
   with mortality in TCGA-KIRC project data. Besides, three mutational
   signatures were found to be operative in the tumor exomes, one of which
   (COSMIC signature 12) has not been previously reported in ccRCC.
   Selection analysis yielded no detectable evidence of overall positive or
   negative selection, with the exome-wide number of nonsynonymous
   substitutions per synonymous site reflecting largely neutral tumor
   evolution. Despite the limited sample size, our results provide evidence
   for candidate genes where somatic mutation burden is tentatively
   associated with patient mortality in metastatic ccRCC, offering new
   potential pharmacological targets and a basis for further validation
   studies.

AB Previous study has shown heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1
   (HNRNPA1) is highly expressed in various human cancers. In order to
   study the clinical value and potential function of HNRNPA1 in
   HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), three datasets from the
   GEPIA, GEO and TCGA were analyzed. HNRNPA1 expression was found to be
   significantly higher in HBV-positive HCC samples, which was supported
   with IHC validation. Both GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that HNRNPA1
   co-expressed genes were involved in translation, ribonucleoprotein
   complex biogenesis and assembly, ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing,
   RNA splicing, etc. Survival analysis showed a significant reduction in
   overall survival of patients with high HNRNPA1 expression from both the
   GSE14520 cohort and 151 patients with HBV-related HCC cohort.
   Furthermore, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that HNRNPA1
   may regulate HCC progression by influencing the cell cycle and WNT
   signaling pathway, etc. HNRNPA1 overexpression has diagnostic value in
   distinguishing between HCC and non-HCC liver tissue (AUC = 0.730).
   Finally, HNRNPA1 was a directly target gene of miR-22 manifested by the
   reduced luciferase activity and decreased HNRNPA1 expression in the
   cells with overexpression of miR-22. HNRNPA1 might function as an
   oncogene through the EGFR signaling pathway in HBV-related HCC, which
   has not been reported in previous studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein is localized in the outer membrane of
   mitochondria, where it plays an important role in promoting cellular
   survival and inhibiting the actions of pro-apoptotic proteins. PRDM10 is
   a member of the PR/SET family of epigenetic regulators and may play a
   role in development and cell differentiation. Here we show that human
   PRDM10 contributes to the transcriptional regulation of human Bcl-2
   gene. We found that PRDM10-depletion in human cells reduced the
   expression of Bcl-2 protein and over-expression of PRDM10 promoted Bcl-2
   protein expression. Furthermore, luciferase reporter activity of Bcl-2
   gene P1 promoter was significantly increased in cells co-transfected
   with PRDM10, and PRDM10 was able to bind to the Bcl-2 P1 promoter in
   vivo. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set, we found weak
   positive correlation between PRDM10 and Bcl-2 in several cancer types
   including cancers of the breast, colon, and lung tissues. These data
   identify a novel function for PRDM10 protein and provide insights on the
   transcriptional control of Bcl-2 expression.

AB Purpose: The T-cell-inflamed phenotype correlates with efficacy of
   immune-checkpoint blockade, whereas non-T-cell-inflamed tumors
   infrequently benefit. Tumor-intrinsic WNT/beta-catenin signaling
   mediates immune exclusion in melanoma, but association with the
   non-T-cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment in other tumor types is not
   well understood.
   Experimental Design: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a
   T-cell-inflamed gene expression signature segregated samples within
   tumor types. Activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling was inferred using
   three approaches: somatic mutations or somatic copy number alterations
   (SCNA) in beta-catenin signaling elements including CTNNB1, APC, APC2,
   AXIN1, and AXIN2; pathway prediction from RNA-sequencing gene
   expression; and inverse correlation of beta-catenin protein levels with
   the T-cell-inflamed gene expression signature.
   Results: Across TCGA, 3,137/9,244 (33.9%) tumors were
   non-T-cell-inflamed, whereas 3,161/9,244 (34.2%) were T-cell-inflamed.
   Non-T-cell-inflamed tumors demonstrated significantly lower expression
   of T-cell inflammation genes relative to matched normal tissue, arguing
   for loss of a natural immune phenotype. Mutations of beta-catenin
   signaling molecules in non-T-cell-inflamed tumors were enriched
   three-fold relative to T-cell-inflamed tumors. Across 31 tumors, 28
   (90%) demonstrated activated beta-catenin signaling in the
   non-T-cellinflamed subset by at least one method. This included target
   molecule expression from somatic mutations and/or SCNAs of b-catenin
   signaling elements (19 tumors, 61%), pathway analysis (14 tumors, 45%),
   and increased b-catenin protein levels (20 tumors, 65%).
   Conclusions: Activation of tumor-intrinsic WNT/beta-catenin signaling is
   enriched in non-T-cell-inflamed tumors. These data provide a strong
   rationale for development of pharmacologic inhibitors of this pathway
   with the aim of restoring immune cell infiltration and augmenting
   immunotherapy.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a deadly cancer, is the most lethal and
   common malignant brain tumor, and the leading cause of death in adult
   brain tumors. While genomic data continues to rocket, clinical
   application and translation to patient care are lagging behind. Big data
   now deposited in the TCGA network offers a window to generate novel
   clinical hypotheses. We hypothesized that a TCGAderived gene-classifier
   can be applied across different gene profiling platforms and population
   groups. This gene-classifier validated three robust GBM-subtypes across
   six different platforms, among Caucasian, Korean and Chinese
   populations: Three Caucasian-predominant TCGA-cohorts (Affymetrix U133A
   = 548, Agilent Custom-Array = 588, RNA-seq = 168), and three
   Asian-cohorts (Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST-Array = 61, Illumina = 52,
   Agilent 4 x 44 K = 60). To understand subtype-relevance in patient
   therapy, we investigated retrospective TCGA patient clinical sets.
   Subtype-specific patient survival outcome was similarly poor and
   reflected the net result of a mixture of treatment regimens with/without
   surgical resection. As a proof-of-concept, in subtype-specific
   patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mice, Classical-subtype
   demonstrated no survival difference comparing radiationtherapy versus
   temozolomide monotherapies. Though preliminary, a PDOX model of
   Proneural/Neuralsubtype demonstrated significantly improved survival
   with temozolomide compared to radiationtherapy. A larger scale study
   using this gene-classifier may be useful in clinical outcome prediction
   and patient selection for trials based on subtyping.

AB Endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EEC) are the most common malignant
   gynecologic tumors. Despite the increase in EEC molecular knowledge, the
   identification of new biomarkers involved in disease's development
   and/or progression would represent an improvement in its course.
   High-mobility group A protein (HMGA) family members are frequently
   overexpressed in a wide range of malignancies, correlating with a poor
   prognosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze HMGA1 and HMGA2
   expression pattern and their potential role as EEC biomarkers. HMGA1 and
   HMGA2 expression was initially evaluated in a series of 46 EEC tumors
   (stages IA to IV), and the findings were then validated in The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) EEC cohort, comprising 381 EEC tumors (stages IA to
   IV). Our results reveal that HMGA1 and HMGA2 mRNA and protein are
   overexpressed in ECC, but only HMGA1 expression is associated with
   increased histological grade and tumor size. Moreover, HMGA1 but not
   HMGA2 overexpression was identified as a negative prognostic factor to
   EEC patients. Finally, a positive correlation between expression of
   HMGA1 pseudogenes-HMGA1-P6 and HMGA1-P7-and HMGA1 itself was detected,
   suggesting HMGA1 pseudogenes may play a role in HMGA1 expression
   regulation in EEC. Thus, these results indicate that HMGA1
   overexpression possesses a potential role as a prognostic biomarker for
   EEC.

AB BACKGROUND: The murine double minute-2 gene (MDM2) was originally
   identified as predicting chemotherapy efficacy. However, little is known
   regarding the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   in the p53 signaling pathway and prognosis/chemotherapy sensitivity in
   colorectal cancer.
   METHODS: We analyzed the association between 111 SNPs in 22 p53
   signaling pathway genes and both progression-free survival (PFS) and
   disease control rate (DCR) using Cox regression and logistics regression
   analysis. The false discovery rate method was used for correction of
   multiple testing. Secondary structure was predicted by RNAfold.
   Expression qualitative trait locus analysis and mRNA expression
   differences were assessed using the GTEx and TCGA databases.
   RESULTS: We found that the rs747828 C allele of TP73 was significantly
   associated with reduced PFS (HR=1.64, 95% CI=1.27-2.12, P=2.00*10-4 ) in
   the additive model. In the stratified analysis, the rs747828 C allele
   was significantly associated with both reduced PFS (P=1.40*10-3 ) and
   DCR (P=1.82*10-2 ) in oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. The secondary
   structure of TP73 was altered in response to different rs747828
   genotypes. Although the rs747828 C allele was not associated with
   messenger RNA (mRNA) TP73 expression, it was significantly associated
   with increased mRNA TP73-AS1 expression levels in sigmoid tissues. TP73
   mRNA was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to
   adjacent normal tissues (P=2.36*10-19 ).
   CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that functional genetic variants of
   TP73 mediate the response to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBCs) is a very aggressive and lethal
   form of breast cancer with no effective targeted therapy. Neoadjuvant
   chemotherapies and radiotherapy remains a mainstay of treatment with
   only 25-30% of TNBC patients responding. Thus, there is an unmet
   clinical need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for TNBCs. TNBC
   cells have increased intracellular oxidative stress and suppressed
   glutathione, a major antioxidant system, but still, are protected
   against higher oxidative stress. We screened a panel of antioxidant
   genes using the TCGA and METABRIC databases and found that expression of
   the thioredoxin pathway genes is significantly upregulated in TNBC
   patients compared to non-TNBC patients and is correlated with adverse
   survival outcomes. Treatment with auranofin (AF), an FDA-approved
   thioredoxin reductase inhibitor caused specific cell death and impaired
   the growth of TNBC cells grown as spheroids. Furthermore, AF treatment
   exerted a significant in vivo antitumor activity in multiple TNBC models
   including the syngeneic 4T1.2 model, MDA-MB-231 xenograft and
   patient-derived tumor xenograft by inhibiting thioredoxin redox
   activity. We, for the first time, showed that AF increased CD8+Ve T-cell
   tumor infiltration in vivo and upregulated immune checkpoint PD-L1
   expression in an ERK1/2-MYC-dependent manner. Moreover, combination of
   AF with anti-PD-L1 antibody synergistically impaired the growth of 4T1.2
   primary tumors. Our data provide a novel therapeutic strategy using AF
   in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody that warrants further clinical
   investigation for TNBC patients.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the functional role of
   Rab39a in human cervical cancer (CC) and the underlying molecular
   mechanisms. We first measured Rab39a mRNA expression in CC tissues and
   paired non-tumor tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR).
   Overall survival of CC patients with different mRNA levels of Rab39a in
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was assessed by Kaplan-Meier
   survival curves analysis. Next methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was
   performed to determine the expression mechanism of Rab39a. Then cell
   proliferation, migration and invasion of Rab39a-transfected or
   mock-transfected cervical cancer cells were determined by CCK-8, flow
   cytometry, wound healing, transwell migration and invasion assays,
   respectively. Finally, the molecular mechanism by which Rab39a modulated
   CC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was explored. It was
   found that Rab39a mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the high-risk
   patients compared to the low-risk patients (p = 0.0054). Six of seven
   cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis express low Rab39a mRNA
   compared to the surrounding non-tumor tissues. Cervical cancer patients
   with low level of Rab39a were showed a poorly clinical outcome (p =
   0.004). Loss of Rab39a expression in cervical cancer tissues was
   associated with the aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter of Rab39a
   gene. Disrupted Rab39a expression in cervical cancer cells could be
   restored after treatment with the demethylated agent
   5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, it was found that Rab39a hardly
   influenced cell growth but significantly suppressed cell migration,
   invasion and EMT process. Rab39a exerted its potential suppressor
   functions through inhibiting AKT phosphorylation. The inhibition effects
   of Rab39a could be blocked by AKT pathway inhibitor. Collectively, our
   data shows that Rab39a is a potential epigenetic silenced tumor
   suppressor inhibiting cancer invasion and migration through modulating
   the AKT signaling.

AB Metastatic progression is a major cause of mortality in cervical
   cancers, but factors regulating migratory and pre-metastatic cell
   populations remain poorly understood. Here, we sought to assess whether
   a SUV39H1-low chromatin state promotes migratory cell populations in
   cervical cancers, using meta-analysis of data from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA), inununohistochemistry, genomics and functional assays.
   Cervical cancer cells sorted based on migratory ability in vitro have
   low levels of SUV39H1 protein, and SUV39H1 knockdown in vitro enhanced
   cervical cancer cell migration. Further, TCGA SUV39H1-low tumours
   correlated with poor clinical outcomes and showed gene expression
   signatures of cell migration. SUV39H1 expression was examined within
   biopsies, and SUV39H1(low) cells within tumours also demonstrated
   migratory features. Next, to understand genome scale transcriptional and
   chromatin changes in migratory populations, cell populations sorted
   based on migration in vitro were examined using RNA-Seq, along with
   ChIP-Seq for H3K9me3, the histone mark associated with SUV39H1. Migrated
   populations showed SUV39H1-linked migratory gene expression signatures,
   along with broad depletion of H3K9me3 across gene promoters. We show for
   the first time that a SUV39H1-low chromatin state associates with, and
   promotes, migratory populations in cervical cancers. Our results posit
   SUV39H1-low cells as key populations for prognosis estimation and as
   targets for novel therapies.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate the biological role of
   C5orf34 in Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and the mechanism of such role.
   Methods: The mRNA expression of C5orf34 was analyzed using student's
   t-test based on the data obtained from TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier
   analysis was performed to evaluate the prognosis value of C5orf34.
   Chi-square (chi(2)) test was performed to analyze the correlation
   between C5orf34 expression and clinical features. The effect of C5orf34
   siRNA on A549 and SPCA1 cells proliferation and migration were explored
   using CCK8 assay, wound healing assay and transwell assays,
   respectively. Western blot was performed to evaluate the expression of
   C5orf34, ERK, p-ERK, MEK and p-MEK.
   Results: C5orf34 expression was enhanced in LAD and positively
   correlated with poor prognosis in patients with LAD. chi(2) test
   revealed that C5orf34 expression was obviously associated with age (p =
   0.016), Pathologic-Stage (p = 0.045) and Pathologic-N (p = 0.023). In
   addition, knockdown of C5orf34 significantly suppressed A549 and SPCA1
   cells proliferation and motility (p < 0.01) in vitro. Moreover, by
   western blot analysis, we found that depleting C5orf34 remarkably
   reduced the ratio of p-MEK/MEK and p-ERK/ERK in A549 cells.
   Conclusion: Our results firstly revealed that C5orf34 might play a
   facilitating role in LAD development and progression by regulating MAPK
   signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data implied that C5orf34 may be a
   potential predictor and treatment target for LAD.

   RESULTS: Our proposed approach creates a patient-to-patient similarity
   graph for each data type as an intermediate representation of each omics
   data type and merges the graphs through subspace analysis on a Grassmann
   manifold. We hypothesize that this approach generates more informative
   clusters by preserving the complementary information from each level of
   omics data. We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   breast cancer dataset and show that by integrating gene expression,
   microRNA and DNA methylation data, our proposed method can produce
   clinically useful subtypes of breast cancer. We then investigate the
   molecular characteristics underlying these subtypes. We discover a
   highly expressed cluster of genes on chromosome 19p13 that strongly
   correlates with survival in TCGA breast cancer patients and validate
   these results in three additional breast cancer datasets. We also
   compare our approach with previous integrative clustering approaches and
   obtain comparable or superior results.

AB Prioritising long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) for functional
   characterisation is a significant challenge. Here we applied
   computational approaches to discover lincRNAs expected to play a
   critical housekeeping (HK) role within the cell. Using the Illumina
   Human BodyMap RNA sequencing dataset as a starting point, we first
   identified lincRNAs ubiquitously expressed across a panel of human
   tissues. This list was then further refined by reference to conservation
   score, secondary structure and promoter DNA methylation status. Finally,
   we used tumour expression and copy number data to identify lincRNAs
   rarely downregulated or deleted in multiple tumour types. The resulting
   list of candidate essential lincRNAs was then subjected to co-expression
   analyses using independent data from ENCODE and The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA). This identified a substantial subset with a predicted role in
   DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. One of these, HKlincR1, was
   selected for further characterisation. Depletion of HKlincR1 affected
   cell growth in multiple lung cancer cell lines, and led to disruption of
   genes involved in cell growth and viability. In addition, HKlincR1
   expression was correlated with overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma
   patients. Our in silico studies therefore reveal a set of housekeeping
   noncoding RNAs of interest both in terms of their role in normal
   homeostasis, and their relevance in tumour growth and maintenance.

AB Colon cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in tumor
   metastasis of colon cancer. We first evaluated the effects of
   EMT-related transcription factors on the prognosis of colon cancer
   through analysis the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
   And then we screened a series of Chinese medicine monomers to find
   effect EMT inhibitors. First, Snail is a more important EMT
   transcription factors for colon cancer prognosis, compared with Twist
   and Slug. Then, we found that apigenin effectively inhibits the activity
   of Snail. Apigenin could inhibit the EMT, migration, and invasion of
   human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo through the NF-kappa
   B/Snail pathway. Snail is a key regulator of EMT in colon cancer and
   Snail inhibitor apigenin may be a therapeutic application for patients
   with colon cancer.

AB BackgroundMatrix metalloproteinase 19 (MMP19) is a member of
   zinc-dependent endopeptidases, which have been involved in various
   physiological and pathological processes. Its expression has been
   demonstrated in some types of cancers, but the clinical significance of
   MMP19 in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been reported. Thus, we aimed
   to analyze the clinical significance of MMP19 in CRC in present
   study.MethodsThe expression of MMP19 was first explored in The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, and then validated in the GSE39582 cohort
   and our own database. Clinicopathological features and survival rate
   were also investigated.ResultsMMP19 was found to be a predictor for
   overall survival (OS) in both univariate (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.449, 95%
   confidence interval [CI]: 1.108-1.893, P=0.007) and multivariate
   survival analyses (HR: 1.401, 95% CI: 1.036-1.894, P=0.028) in the TCGA
   database. MMP19 was further validated as an independent factor for
   recurrence free survival in the GSE39582 database by both univariate
   analysis (HR: 2.061, 95%CI: 1.454-2.921, P<0.001) and multivariate
   analysis (HR=1.470, 95% CI: 1.025-2.215, P=0.032). In an in-house
   cohort, MMP19 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues when compared
   with their adjacent normal controls (P<0.001). Ectopic MMP19 expression
   was positively associated with lymph node metastases (P=0.029),
   intramural vascular invasion (P=0.015) and serum carcinoembryonic
   antigen levels (P=0.045). High MMP19 expression correlated with a
   shorter OS (HR=5.595; 95% CI: 2.573-12.164; P<0.001) and disease free
   survival (HR=4.699; 95% CI: 2.461-8.974; P<0.001) in multivariate cox
   regression analysis.ConclusionsExpression of MMP19 was upregulated in
   CRC. High expression of MMP19 was determined to be an independent and
   poor prognostic factor in CRC. These results suggest that MMP19 may be a
   good biomarker for CRC.

AB BackgroundIn a time of increasing concerns over personalized and
   precision treatment in breast cancer (BC), filtering prognostic factors
   attracts more attention. Apoptosis-Inducing Factor
   Mitochondrion-associated 3 (AIFM3) is widely expressed in various
   tissues and aberrantly expressed in several cancers. However, clinical
   implication of AIFM3 has not been reported in BC. The aim of the study
   is to investigate the crystal structure, clinical and prognostic
   implications of AIFM3 in BC.MethodsAIFM3 expression in 151BC samples
   were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to demonstrate
   expression and survival of AIFM3 signature. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
   (GSEA) was performed to investigate the mechanisms related to AIFM3
   expression in BC.ResultsAIFM3 was significantly more expressed in breast
   cancer tissues than in normal tissues. AIFM3 expression had a
   significant association with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, TNM
   stage and molecular typing. Higher AIFM3 expression was related to a
   shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Lymph
   node metastasis and TNM stage were independent factors of AIFM3
   expression. The study presented the crystal structure of AIFM3
   successfully and predicted several binding sites when AIFM3 bonded to
   PTPN12 by Molecular Operating Environment software
   (MOE).ConclusionsAIFM3 might be a potential biomarker for predicting
   prognosis in BC, adding to growing evidence that AIFM3 might interact
   with PTPN12.

AB BackgroundDeregulation of protein translation control is a hallmark of
   cancers. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A2 (EIF4A2) is required for mRNA
   binding to ribosome and plays an important role in translation
   initiation. However, little is known about its functions in colorectal
   cancer (CRC).MethodsAnalysis of CRC transcriptome data from TCGA
   identified that EIF4A2 was associated with poor prognosis.
   Immunohistochemistry study of EIF4A2 was carried out in 297 paired
   colorectal tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples. In vitro and in
   vivo cell-biological assays were performed to study the biological
   functions of EIF4A2 on experimental metastasis and sensitivity to
   oxaliplatin treatment. Bioinformatic prediction, chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assay were
   carried out to unveil the transcription factor of EIF4A2
   regulation.ResultsEIF4A2 Expression is significantly higher in
   colorectal tumors. Multivariate analysis suggests EIF4A2 as an
   independent predictor of overall, disease-free and progression-free
   survival. Dysfunction of EIF4A2 by genetic knock-down or small-molecule
   inhibitor silvestrol dramatically inhibited CRC invasion and migration,
   sphere formation and enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin treatment in
   vitro and in vivo. Notably, EIF4A2 knock-down also suppressed lung
   metastasis in vivo. qRT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses identified c-Myc
   as a downstream target and effector of EIF4A2. ChIP and dual-luciferase
   reporter assays validated the bioinformatical prediction of ZNF143 as a
   specific transcription factor of EIF4A2.ConclusionsEIF4A2 promotes
   experimental metastasis and oxaliplatin resistance in CRC. Silvestrol
   inhibits tumor growth and has synergistic effects with oxaliplatin to
   induce apoptosis in cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived
   xenograft (PDX) models.

AB BackgroundThe high mortality of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) emphasizes the necessity of identifying a robust and reliable
   prognostic signature for NSCLC patients. This study aimed to identify
   and validate a prognostic signature for the prediction of both
   disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients
   by integrating multiple datasets.MethodsWe firstly downloaded three
   independent datasets under the accessing number of GSE31210, GSE37745
   and GSE50081, and then performed an univariate regression analysis to
   identify the candidate prognostic genes from each dataset, and
   identified the gene signature by overlapping the candidates. Then, we
   built a prognostic model to predict DFS and OS using a risk score
   method. Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test was used to determine the
   prognostic significance. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional
   hazard regression models were implemented to evaluate the influences of
   various variables on DFS and OS. The robustness of the prognostic gene
   signature was evaluated by re-sampling tests based on the combined GEO
   dataset (GSE31210, GSE37745 and GSE50081). Furthermore, a The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA)-NSCLC cohort was utilized to validate the prediction
   power of the gene signature. Finally, the correlation of the risk score
   of the gene signature and the Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) score
   of cancer hallmark gene sets was investigated.ResultsWe identified and
   validated a six-gene prognostic signature in this study. This prognostic
   signature stratified NSCLC patients into the low-risk and high-risk
   groups. Multivariate regression and stratification analyses demonstrated
   that the six-gene signature was an independent predictive factor for
   both DFS and OS when adjusting for other clinical factors. Re-sampling
   analysis implicated that this six-gene signature for predicting
   prognosis of NSCLC patients is robust. Moreover, the risk score of the
   gene signature is correlated with the GSVA score of 7 cancer hallmark
   gene sets.ConclusionThis study provided a robust and reliable gene
   signature that had significant implications in the prediction of both
   DFS and OS of NSCLC patients, and may provide more effective treatment
   strategies and personalized therapies.

AB Pre-operative 5-fluoracil-based chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is the standard
   treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).
   Patients with pathological complete response (pCR-0% of tumor cells in
   the surgical specimen after nCRT) have better overall survival and lower
   risk of recurrence in comparison with incomplete responders (pIR).
   Predictive biomarkers to be used for new therapeutic strategies and
   capable of stratifying patients to avoid overtreatment are needed. We
   evaluated the genomic profiles of 33 pre-treatment LARC biopsies using
   SNP array and targeted-next generation sequencing (tNGS). Based on the
   large number of identified genomic alterations, we calculated the
   genomic instability index (GII) and three homologous recombination
   deficiency (HRD) scores, which have been reported as impaired DNA repair
   markers. We observed high GII in our LARC cases, which was confirmed in
   165 rectal cancer cases from TCGA. Patients with pCR presented higher
   GII compared with pIR. Moreover, a negative correlation between GII and
   the fraction of tumor cells remaining after surgery was observed (rho =
   -0.382, P = 0.02). High HRD scores were detected in 61% of LARC, of
   which 70% were incomplete responders. Using tNGS (105 cancer-related
   genes, 13 involved in HR and 5 in mismatch repair pathways), we
   identified 23% of cases with mutations in HR genes, mostly in pIR cases
   (86% of mutated cases). In agreement, the analysis of the TCGA dataset
   (N = 145) revealed 21% of tumors with mutations in HR genes. The HRD
   scores were shown to be predictive of better response to PARP-inhibitors
   and platinum-based chemotherapy in breast and ovarian cancer. Our

FT Pathway-based biomarker identification with crosstalk analysis for

AB BACKGROUND: Although many prognostic single-gene (SG) lists have been
   identified in cancer research, application of these features is hampered
   due to poor robustness and performance on independent datasets.
   Pathway-based approaches have thus emerged which embed biological
   knowledge to yield reproducible features.
   METHODS: Pathifier estimates pathways deregulation score (PDS) to
   represent the extent of pathway deregulation based on expression data,
   and most of its applications treat pathways as independent without
   addressing the effect of gene overlap between pathway pairs which we
   refer to as crosstalk. Here, we propose a novel procedure based on
   Pathifier methodology, which for the first time has been utilized with
   crosstalk accommodated to identify disease-specific features to predict
   prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   FINDINGS: With the cohort (N = 355) of HCC patients from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA), cross validation (CV) revealed that PDSs identified
   were more robust and accurate than the SG features by deep learning
   (DL)-based approach. When validated on external HCC datasets, these
   features outperformed the SGs consistently.
   INTERPRETATION: On average, we provide 10.2% improvement of prediction
   accuracy. Importantly, governing genes in these features provide
   valuable insight into the cancer hallmarks of HCC. We develop an R
   package PATHcrosstalk (available from GitHub
   https://github.com/fabotao/PATHcrosstalk) with which users can discover
   pathways of interest with crosstalk effect considered.

AB Treatment strategies involving immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) have
   significantly improved survival for a subset of patients across a broad
   spectrum of advanced solid cancers. Despite this, considerable room for
   improving response rates remains. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a
   hurdle to immune function, as the altered metabolism-related acidic
   microenvironment of solid tumors decreases immune activity. Here, we
   determined that expression of the hypoxia-induced, cell-surface pH
   regulatory enzyme carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is associated with worse
   overall survival in a cohort of 449 patients with melanoma. We found
   that targeting CAIX with the small-molecule SLC-0111 reduced glycolytic
   metabolism of tumor cells and extracellular acidification, resulting in
   increased immune cell killing. SLC-0111 treatment in combination with
   immune-checkpoint inhibitors led to the sensitization of tumors to ICB,
   which led to an enhanced Th1 response, decreased tumor growth, and
   reduced metastasis. We identified that increased expression of CA9 is
   associated with a reduced Th1 response in metastatic melanoma and
   basal-like breast cancer TCGA cohorts. These data suggest that targeting
   CAIX in the TME in combination with ICB is a potential therapeutic
   strategy for enhancing response and survival in patients with hypoxic
   solid malignancies.

AB Natural killer (NK) cell activity is essential for initiating antitumor
   responses and may be linked to immunotherapy success. NK cells and other
   innate immune components could be exploitable for cancer treatment,
   which drives the need for tools and methods that identify therapeutic
   avenues. Here, we extend our gene-set scoring method singscore to
   investigate NK cell infiltration by applying RNA-seq analysis to samples
   from bulk tumors. Computational methods have been developed for the
   deconvolution of immune cell types within solid tumors. We have taken
   the NK cell gene signatures from several such tools, then curated the
   gene list using a comparative analysis of tumors and immune cell types.
   Using a gene-set scoring method to investigate RNA-seq data from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show that patients with metastatic
   cutaneous melanoma have an improved survival rate if their tumor shows
   evidence of NK cell infiltration. Furthermore, these survival effects
   are enhanced in tumors that show higher expression of genes that encode
   NK cell stimuli such as the cytokine IL15 Using this signature, we then
   examine transcriptomic data to identify tumor and stromal components
   that may influence the penetrance of NK cells into solid tumors. Our
   results provide evidence that NK cells play a role in the regulation of
   human tumors and highlight potential survival effects associated with
   increased NK cell activity. Our computational analysis identifies
   putative gene targets that may be of therapeutic value for boosting NK
   cell antitumor immunity.

AB The crumbs protein homolog 3 (CRB3) regulates the tight junction to help
   maintain epithelial polarity. Altered CRB3 expression was associated

   expression in 192 cases of breast cancer tissues and in the Molecular
   Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (Metabric) and The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for association with triple negative
   breast cancer (TNBC) phenotypes. The in vitro experiments confirm the ex
   vivo data. The data showed that levels of both CRB3 mRNA and protein
   were associated with TNBC phenotypes, i.e., 41.1% (39/95) of ER+ breast
   cancer was CRB3-positive, whereas 26.9% (25/93) ER- tumor was
   CRB3-positive (p = 0.046). Moreover, 47.6% (30/63) of PR+ breast cancer
   was CRB3-positive vs. 28.4% (33/116) PR- tumors positive for CRB3 (p =
   0.013). In addition, 40.1% (27/66) of ER+ /PR+ tumor was CRB3-positive,
   but only 22.4% (19/85) of TNBC showed CRB3 expression (p = 0.048).
   Indeed, levels of CRB3 mRNA were higher in non-TNBC than TNBC in both
   Metabric (p = 3.682e-10) and TCGA datasets (p = 2.501e-07). The in vitro
   data showed that CRB3 expression was higher in luminal (MCF7 and T47D)
   than in HER2 (MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR-3) and basal (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549)
   breast cancer cell lines. More interestingly, ERalpha regulated
   expression of CRB3 protein in MCF7 and BT-549 cells and ERalpha
   expression was associated with CRB3 expression in breast cancer tissues
   specimens. This study demonstrated that ERalpha could be a novel
   regulator for CRB3 expression in breast cancer. This article is

AB BACKGROUND: Plakophilin 2 (PKP2), encodes a plakophilin protein that
   belongs to the member of desmosomal proteins. It has been reported that
   high expression of PKP2 is associated with several types of cancer in
   humans. However, the role of PKP2 in lung cancer remains obscure.
   METHODS: PKP2 expression was investigated in non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) tissues and non-tumor tissues by performing immunohistochemistry
   on a tissue microarray and using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox-regression
   analysis were performed to identify the clinical significance of PKP2.
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl
   )-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), colony formation, Transwell and xenograft tumor
   growth/ metastasis assays were conducted to evaluate the biological
   function of PKP2 in vitro and in vivo. Gene set enrichment analysis
   (GSEA), WB and immunoprecipitation (IP) assay were utilized to explore
   the potential downstream signaling pathway and molecule mechanism of
   PKP2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
   RESULTS: Analysis of PKP2 expression and clinicopathological parameters
   reveals a significant correlation of PKP2 expression with gender
   (n=1020, P<0.001) and histological type (n=1020, P<0.001). Subsequently,
   our results demonstrated that high PKP2 expression is not associated
   with poor survival in different gender of lung cancer patients, and is
   an unfavorable and independent prognostic biomarker for LUAD patients,
   but not for LUSC patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed
   that PKP2 expression is positively associated with EGFR signaling in
   LUAD. Further, in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that PKP2 promotes
   cell proliferation, migration and invasion through activating EGFR
   signaling pathway in LUAD cells.
   CONCLUSION: Our study provides the basis for further investigation of
   the function and molecular mechanism by which upregulation of PKP2
   promotes the development and progression of LUAD. PKP2 may serve as a
   potential target for anticancer therapies.

AB The truncating mutations of RNF43 frequently occur in CRC, we aimed to
   clarify the relationship between RNF43 frameshift mutations and MS
   status, BRAF V600E mutation, distant metastasis, TNM stage and location
   of CRC. RNF43 frameshift mutations R117.fs and G659.fs and BRAF V600E
   mutation were detected in 392 sporadic CRC samples from our tissue bank.
   We integrated our original study with the TCGA database and five
   published datasets to analyse the relationship between RNF43 frameshift
   mutation and tumour location, distant metastasis, TNM stage and BRAF
   V600E mutation in 2396 CRC samples when controlling for MS status. RNF43
   frameshift mutation was correlated with MSI-H (OR=122.27) [31.82,
   469.92], BRAF V600E mutation (OR=7.92 [3.45, 18.18]), distant metastasis
   (OR=0.30 [0.17, 0.53]), advanced TNM stage (OR=0.34)[0.23, 0.51], and
   right colon site (OR=8.32 [2.98, 23.22]). After controlling for the
   effect of MS status, there was no correlation of RNF43 frameshift
   mutation with distant metastasis (OR=1.57 [0.75, 3.28]) and advanced TNM
   stages (OR=0.98 [0.58, 1.67]), but RNF43 frameshift mutations still
   occur more frequently in right colon (OR=2.58 [1.49, 4.47]) and with
   BRAF V600E mutation (OR=1.94 [1.22, 3.10]). RNF43 frameshift mutations
   were related to distant metastasis and TNM-stage in an MS
   status-dependent manner, but they contributed to tumourigenesis in
   right-sided colon cancer independent of MS status.

TI miR-940 potentially promotes proliferation and metastasis of endometrial
   carcinoma through regulation of MRVI1.
SO Bioscience reports

PD 2019-May-13
PY 2019
AB The specific functions and clinical significance of miR-940 in
   endometrial carcinoma (EC) have not been studied.Firstly, we assessed
   the expression of miR-940 and MRVI1 in EC tissues collected from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and EC cell lines. miR-940 was
   significantly over-expressed in EC tissues and cell lines, particularly
   in RL95-2 cells. Correlation analysis showed that miR-940 expression
   level was remarkably associated with age, grade, and death. Moreover,
   the overall survival (OS) rate in the miR-940 low expression group was
   higher, compared with miR-940 high expression group. Univariate and
   multivariate models demonstrated that miR-940 expression, stage, and age
   were predictive indicators of OS. Moreover, there was no significance of
   the proliferation ability among the three EC cell lines (RL95-2, ISK,
   and KLE). To reveal the biological roles of miR-940, we respectively
   transfected RL95-2 cells with miR-940 mimics, miR-940 inhibitors, and
   control to further investigate the cell proliferation ability, and
   migration as well as invasion potential of RL95-2 cells. The
   transfection of miR-940 mimics significantly increased the proliferation
   and migration/invasion ability of RL95-2 cells. MRVI1 was predicted to
   be a potential target of miR-940 by means of in silico analysis followed
   by validation using luciferase reporter assays. MRVI1 was correlated
   with good prognosis. Moreover, forced expression of MRVI1 in miR-940
   mimic transfected cells abolished the facilitation of miR-940 on cell
   proliferation, migration and invasion of RL95-2 and KLE cells. In
   conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-940 might function as a
   reliable diagnostic and prognostic signature in EC.

TI A 4-gene panel predicting the survival of patients with glioblastoma.
SO Journal of cellular biochemistry
DI 10.1002/jcb.28883
PD 2019-May-13
PY 2019
AB BACKGROUND: To identify independently prognostic gene panel in patients
   with glioblastoma (GBM).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-GBM was used as a
   training set and a test set. GSE13041 was used as a validation set.
   Survival associated differentially expression genes (DEGs), derived
   between GBM and normal brain tissue, was obtained using univariate Cox
   proportional hazards regression model and then was included in a least
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized Cox proportional
   hazards regression model. Thus, a 4-gene prognostic panel was developed
   based on the risk score for each patient in that model. The prognostic
   role of the 4-gene panel was validated using univariate and
   multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model.
   RESULTS: A total of 686 patients with GBMwere included in our study;724
   DEGs was identified, 133 of which was significantly correlated with the
   overall survival (OS) of patients with GBM. A 4-gene panel including
   NMB, RTN1, GPC5, and epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) was developed.
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggested that patients in the 4-gene
   panel low risk group had significantly better OS than those in the
   4-gene panel high risk group in the training set (hazard ratio
   [HR]=0.3826;95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2751-0.532;P<0.0001), test
   set (HR=0.718;95% CI: 0.5282-0.9759;P=0.033) and the independent
   validation set (HR=0.6898;95% CI: 0.4872-0.9766;P=0.035). Both
   univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression
   analysis suggested that the 4-gene panel was independent prognostic
   factor for GBM in the training set.
   CONCLUSION: We developed and validated 4-gene panel that was
   independently correlated with the survival of patients with GBM.

TI ALDOLASE A regulates invasion of bladder cancer cells via
   E-cadherin-EGFR signaling.
SO Journal of cellular biochemistry
DI 10.1002/jcb.28642
PD 2019-May-13
PY 2019
AB Glycolysis and glycogenesis are known to be tightly associated with
   cancer cell migration. However, their roles in bladder cancer have not
   been reported. In this study, ALDOLASE A (ALDOA) was identified in a
   coexpression network generated using glycolysis- and
   glycogenesis-related genes in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
   ALDOA was located in the central region in the network, and the cancer
   genome atlas (TCGA) data suggest that ALDOA expression levels are
   associated with viability in patients with cancer at the middle and late
   stages. Bladder cancer cell lines, T24 and RT4, were used to knockdown
   (sh) or overexpress (OE) ALODA to analyze its role. The sh-ALDOA reduced
   cell viability, colony formation rate, and invasion cell number; while
   OE had an opposite effect compared with sh-ALDOA. Further, the sh-ALDOA
   expression induced E-cadherin level while reduced N-cadherin and
   vimentin levels. The OE cells reduced E-cadherin and induced N-cadherin
   and vimentin levels. In addition, epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and AKT
   serine/threonine kinase (AKT) phosphorylation levels are all reduced in
   sh-ALODA while activated in OE cells compared with the control group.
   But either sh-ALODA or OE did not change total protein levels of EGFR,
   MAPK, and AKT. To further analyze E-cadherin function in ALDOA
   regulation on bladder cancer cells, sh-ALDOA and sh-E-cadherin were
   cotransfected in T24 and RT4 cells. The results indicated that sh-ALDOA
   and sh-E-cadherin expressions eliminated sh-ALDOA function, resulting
   similar cell viability, colony formation rate, and invasion cell number
   with control group. Also, sh-ALDOA and shE-cadherin expressions
   increased EGFR, MAPK, and AKT phosphorylation levels; and the levels
   were similar to the control group. But, sh-ALDOA and sh-E-cadherin
   expressions did not change N-cadherin and vimentin levels, which
   maintain similar levels with sh-ALDOA-expressing cells. Taken together,
   these results suggest that ALDOA might play an important function in
   bladder cancer and its action may be though E-cadherin-EGFR signaling.

TI Identification of aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes
   in breast cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.
SO Journal of cellular biochemistry
DI 10.1002/jcb.28904
PD 2019-May-12
PY 2019
AB BACKGROUND: Abnormal DNA methylation has been demonstrated to drive
   breast cancer tumorigenesis. Thus, this study aimed to explore
   differentially expressed biomarkers driven by aberrant methylation in
   breast cancer and explore potential pathological mechanisms using
   comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.
   METHODS: Gene microarray datasets of expression (GSE45827) and
   methylation (GSE32393) were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus
   database. Abnormally methylated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   were obtained by overlapping datasets. Functional enrichment analysis of
   screened genes and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were
   executed with the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes
   database. PPI networks were visualized, and hub genes were screened
   using Cytoscape software. The results were further verified using
   Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Finally, the
   genetic alterations and prognostic roles of hub genes were analyzed.
   RESULTS: In total, we found 18 hypomethylated upregulated oncogenes and
   21 hypermethylated downregulated tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). These
   genes were mainly linked to the biological process categories of
   cellular component movement and cellular metabolism as well as nuclear
   factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
   signaling pathways. Six hub genes were identified: three hypomethylated
   upregulated oncogenes (BCL2, KIT, and RARA) and three hypermethylated
   downregulated TSGs (ATM, DICER1, and DNMT1). The expression and
   methylation status of hub genes validated in Oncomine and TCGA databases
   were significantly altered and were consistent with our findings.
   Downregulation of BCL2, KIT, ATM, and DICER1 was closely associated with
   shorter overall survival in breast cancer patients. In addition, the
   expression levels of ATM and DICER1 were significantly distinct among
   different subgroups of clinical stages, molecular subtypes, and
   histological types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals possible methylation-based DEGs and
   involved pathways in breast cancer, which could provide novel insights
   into underlying pathogenesis mechanisms. Abnormally methylated oncogenes
   and TSGs, especially ATM and DICER1, may emerge as novel biomarkers and
   therapeutic targets for breast cancer in the future.

TI A Bayesian Two-Way Latent Structure Model for Genomic Data Integration
   Reveals Few Pan-Genomic Cluster Subtypes in a Breast Cancer Cohort.
SO Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)
DI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz381
PD 2019-May-11
PY 2019
AB MOTIVATION: Unsupervised clustering is important in disease subtyping,
   among having other genomic applications. As genomic data has become more
   multifaceted, how to cluster across data sources for more precise
   subtyping is an ever more important area of research. Many of the
   methods proposed so far, including iCluster and Cluster of Cluster
   Assignments, make an unreasonble assumption of a common clustering
   across all data sources, and those that do not are fewer and tend to be
   computationally intensive.
   RESULTS: We propose a Bayesian parametric model for integrative,
   unsupervised clustering across data sources. In our two-way latent
   structure model, samples are clustered in relation to each specific data
   source, distinguishing it from methods like Cluster of Cluster
   Assignments and iCluster, but cluster labels have across-dataset
   meaning, allowing cluster information to be shared between data sources.
   A common scaling across data sources is not required, and inference is
   obtained by a Gibbs Sampler, which we improve with a warm start strategy
   and modified density functions to robustify and speed convergence.
   Posterior interpretation allows for inference on common clusterings
   occurring among subsets of data sources. An interesting statistical
   formulation of the model results in sampling from closed-form posteriors
   despite incorporation of a complex latent structure. We fit the model
   with Gaussian and more general densities, which influences the degree of
   across-dataset cluster label sharing. Uniquely among integrative
   clustering models, our formulation makes no nestedness assumptions of
   samples across data sources so that a sample missing data from one
   genomic source can be clustered according to its existing data sources.
   We apply our model to a Norwegian breast cancer cohort of ductal
   carcinoma in-situ and invasive tumors, comprised of somatic copy-number
   alteration, methylation and expression datasets. We find enrichment in
   the Her2 subtype and ductal carcinoma among those observations
   exhibiting greater cluster correspondence across expression and CNA
   data. In general, there are few pan-genomic clusterings, suggesting that
   models assuming a common clustering across genomic data sources might
   yield misleading results.
   IMPLEMENTATION AND AVAILABILITY: The model is implemented in an R
   package called twl ("two-way latent"), available on CRAN. Data for
   analysis is available within the R package.
   CONTACT: ORCID: 0000-0003-3174-1656.
   SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: Appendices available online include additional
   breast cancer subtyping analysis and model runs, comparison with leading
   integrative clustering methods, general statistical formulation,
   description of Gibbs sampler improvements, and analyses of METABRIC and
   TCGA cohorts.

AB BackgroundUbinuclein-2 (UBN2) is a nuclear protein that interacts with
   many transcription factors. The molecular role and mechanism of UBN2 in
   the development and progression of cancers, including colorectal cancer
   (CRC), is not well understood. The current study explored the role of
   UBN2 in the development and progression CRC.MethodsOncomine network and
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded and Gene Set
   Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to compare the UBN2s expression
   between normal and tumor tissues, as well as the potential correlation
   of UBN2 expression with signaling pathways. Immunohistochemistry (IHC),
   qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to determine the expression
   of UBN2 in CRC tissues or cell lines. In vitro proliferation and
   invasion assays, and orthotopic mouse metastatic model were used to
   analyze the effect of UBN2 on the development and progression of
   CRC.ResultsThe analysis of UBN2 expression using Oncomine network showed
   that UBN2 was upregulated in CRC tissues compared to matched adjacent
   normal intestinal epithelial tissues. IHC, qRT-PCR and Western blotting
   confirmed that UBN2 expression is higher in CRC tissues compared with
   matched adjacent normal intestinal epithelial tissues. In addition,
   analyses of TCGA data revealed that high UBN2 expression was associated
   with advanced stages of lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and
   short survival time in CRC patients. IHC showed that high UBN2
   expression is correlated with advanced stages of CRC. Moreover, UBN2 is
   highly expressed in the liver metastatic lesions. Furthermore, knockdown
   of UBN2 inhibited the growth, invasiveness and metastasis of CRC cells
   via regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.ConclusionThe current
   study demonstrates that UBN2 promotes tumor progression in CRC. UBN2 may
   be used as a promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis of CRC
   patients.

AB Uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas (UCEC) are clinically divided into
   two subgroups - endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) or
   non-endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (NEEC). The first group shows
   relatively better prognosis. However, the discrimination seems to be
   insufficient due to the fact that in the mildest EEC are patients with
   poor treatment response and bad prognosis. Our aim was to examine the
   molecular background of such phenomenon and whether gene expression
   patterns might be of importance for the clinic. We focused our analysis
   on WNT pathway target genes since it is one of the main regulators of
   endometrial proliferation and differentiation. In silico analysis of
   TCGA data, including Weighted Co-expression Network Analysis, Principle
   Component Analysis, and Multiple Factor Analysis, allows to select 28
   genes that serve as a predictive markers for UCEC patients. Our study
   revealed that there is a subgroup of the endometrioid cases that
   molecularly resembles mixed/serous groups. This may explain the reason
   for existence of subgroup of patients, that although clinically
   diagnosed with the mildest endometrioid UCEC type, yet present failure
   in treatment and aggressive course of the disease. Our study suggests
   that worse outcome in these patients may be based on a disruption of
   proper WNT signalling pathway resulting in deregulation of its effector
   genes. Moreover, we showed that mixed group consisting of tumours
   containing both endometrioid and serous types of cells, has serous
   expression profile of WNT targets. The proposed gene set allows to
   predict progression of the disease trough dividing patients into groups
   of low or high grade with 70.8% sensitivity and 88.6% specificity (AUC =
   0.837) as well as could predict patient prognosis associated with UCEC
   subtype with 70.1% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity (AUC = 0.855).
   Relatively small number of implicated genes makes it highly applicable
   and possibly clinically simple and useful tool.

AB Background and objectiveOvarian cancer is a common gynaecological cancer
   with a poor prognosis that poses a serious threat to human life and
   health. It is essential to explore the possible prognostic biomarkers of
   ovarian cancer. As an important tumour suppressor gene, BCL7A actively
   participates in the growth of tumours. We aimed to study the prognostic
   role of BCL7A in ovarian cancer.ResultsThrough data mining of RNAseq
   data from the Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA), we explored the
   clinical relevance of BCL7A mRNA expression. As a result, we found that
   BCL7A is expressed at low levels in ovarian cancer tissues and is
   correlated with survival status. Survival analysis showed that, compared
   with those who had higher levels of BCL7A expression, patients with
   ovarian cancer and low levels of BCL7A generally had shorter
   overall/relapse-free survival times. Cox regression models showed that
   low BCL7A expression could be used as an independent prognostication
   factor for ovarian cancer patients.ConclusionsLow BCL7A expression is an
   independent risk factor for poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients.

AB The current study was undertaken to investigate the potential influence
   of methylation on miR-362-5p/3p expression and further analyzed their
   independent prognostic value in cervical adenocarcinoma (ADC) and
   squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) respectively. SiHa and CaSki cells were
   used as the in vitro cell model. In silico bioinformatic analysis was
   conducted via the combined use of the Cancer Genome Atlas-Cervical
   Cancer (TCGA-CESC), Starbase 3.0 and String 10.5. Results revealed that
   the downregulation of miR-362-5p/3p was accompanied by the infection of
   high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and their expression was further
   decreased in HR-HPV cancer tissues. Demethylation could restore their
   expression. By performing Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) based on
   methylated or unmethylated specific primers, we confirmed that the
   proximal promoter region was methylated in both cell lines. Higher
   miR-362-3p expression might independently predict favorable overall
   survival (OS) in SCC patients (HR: 0.561, 95%CI: 0.354-0.889, p=0.014),
   after adjustment of clinical stages, lymphovascular invasion and
   miR-362-5p expression. However, no prognostic value of miR-362-5p or
   miR-362-3p expression was observed in terms of OS in patients with ADC.
   Via bioinformatic analysis, we found that miR-362-3p might have an
   entirely different regulatory network in cervical ADC and SCC, which
   might help to explain the distinct prognostic value of miR-362-3p in
   these two histological subtypes. In summary, we infer that the
   methylation level of the proximal promoter region of pre-miR-362 would
   influence the expression of miR-362-5p/3p in cervical cancer. MiR-362-3p
   expression might be a specific prognostic biomarker in cervical SCC, but
   not in ADC.

TI Immune suppression by PD-L2 against spontaneous and treatment-related

AB PURPOSE: To evaluate the detailed immunosuppressive role(s) of PD-L2
   given that its detailed role(s) remain unclear in PD-1 signal blockade
   therapy in animal models and humans.
   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated mouse cell lines harboring various
   status of PD-L1/PD-L2 and evaluated the tumor growth and phenotypes of
   tumor infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs) using several PD-1 signal blockades
   in animal models. In humans, the correlation between immune-related gene
   expression and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) or PDCD1LG2 (encoding PD-L2) was
   investigated using TCGA datasets. In addition, PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression
   in tumor cells and CD8+T cell-infiltration were assessed by
   immunohistochemistry.
   RESULTS: In animal models, we showed that PD-L2 expression alone or
   simultaneously expressed with PD-L1 in tumor cells significantly
   suppressed antitumor immune responses, such as tumor antigen-specific
   CD8+T cells, and was involved in the resistance to treatment with
   anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone. This resistance was overcome
   by anti-PD-1 mAb or combined treatment with anti-PD-L2 mAb. In clinical
   settings, antitumor immune responses were significantly correlated with
   PD-L2 expression in the tumor microenvironment in renal cell carcinoma
   (RCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).
   CONCLUSIONS: We propose that PD-L2 as well as PD-L1 play important roles
   in evading antitumor immunity, suggesting that PD-1/PD-L2 blockade must
   be considered for optimal immunotherapy in PD-L2-expressing cancers,
   such as RCC and LUSC.

AB BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignancy occurring
   in women worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that small nucleolar
   RNAs (snoRNAs) play a role in tumor development. In the current study,
   we evaluated expression profiles and functions of snoRNAs associated
   with BC.MethodsWe analyzed the expression levels of snoRNAs between
   breast cancer and normal tissues in TCGA database and found that SNORA7B
   is upregulated in BC. We confirmed this result in clinical cancer
   tissues and BC cell lines via qRT-PCR. Then, we investigated clinical
   significance in public datasets and biological function of SNORA7B using
   a series of in vitro gain- and loss-of-function
   experiments.ResultsSNORA7B expression was significantly upregulated in
   samples from patients with BC in both public database and our clinical
   tissues compared to its expression in normal tissues. Meanwhile,
   patients with high SNORA7B expression have worse prognosis. Inhibition
   of SNORA7B expression impaired cell growth, proliferation, migration,
   and invasion via inducing apoptosis.ConclusionsSNORA7B functions as an
   important oncogenic snoRNA in BC and may serve as a potential prognosis
   biomarker for BC.

AB Recent technological evolutions have led to an exponential increase in
   data in all the omics fields. It is expected that integration of these
   different data sources, will drastically enhance our knowledge of the
   biological mechanisms behind genomic diseases such as cancer. However,
   the integration of different omics data still remains a challenge. In
   this work we propose an intuitive workflow for the integrative analysis
   of expression, mutation and copy number data taken from the METABRIC
   study on breast cancer. First, we present evidence that the expression
   profile of many important breast cancer genes consists of two modes or
   regimes', which contain important clinical information. Then, we show
   how the co-occurrence of these expression regimes can be used as an
   association measure between genes and validate our findings on the
   TCGA-BRCA study. Finally, we demonstrate how these co-occurrence
   measures can also be applied to link expression regimes to genomic
   aberrations, providing a more complete, integrative view on breast
   cancer. As a case study, an integrative analysis of the identified
   MLPH-FOXA1 association is performed, illustrating that the obtained
   expression associations are intimately linked to the underlying genomic
   changes.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Dirk Walther, Francisco

AB Although head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has in the past
   been largely associated with tobacco use, human papillomavirus (HPV+)
   oropharynx cancer has in recent years emerged as the fastest growing
   type of HNSCC. Patients with HPV+ HNSCC have a better prognosis;
   however, the 5-year survival for both HPV+ and HPV- subtypes with
   recurrent or metastatic disease is poor. To gain insights into the tumor
   microenvironments of both HNSCC subtypes and identify potential
   therapeutic targets, we performed epigenomic deconvolution on 580 HNSCC
   samples from the TCGA dataset. Deconvolution revealed distinct molecular
   and histoepigenetic profiles of the two tumor subtypes, including their
   cellular composition, epigenomic profiles and gene expression for
   constituent cell types, and potential cancer cell-specific targets. Our
   analyses show that high abundance of both CD8 T-cells and B-cells
   explains better prognosis in HPV+ HNSCC. Deconvolution of gene
   expression profiles revealed higher expression of the immunotherapy
   target PD-1 in HPV+ immune cells compared to HPV- cells, suggesting that
   HPV+ tumors may preferentially benefit from PD-1 targeted therapy.
   Further analyses identified HPV+ and HPV- cancer cell surface proteins
   that can also serve as potential targets for therapy. Specifically, Wnt
   pathway receptor ROR2 is preferentially overexpressed in HPV+ subtypes,
   suggesting opportunities for development of targeted therapy based on
   HPV status. In summary, the comprehensive molecular and histoepigenetic
   analysis of tumor microenvironments by epigenomic deconvolution reveals
   potential novel biomarkers and targets for precision therapy of HNSCC.

AB PURPOSE: Laryngeal squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most
   common malignant tumor of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The
   study was aimed to identify key long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
   biomarkers for LSCC.
   METHODS: Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and mRNAs
   (DEmRNAs) between LSCC and adjacent tissues were obtained based on The
   Cancer Genome Atlas. DElncRNA-DEmRNAs co-expression and
   DElncRNA-nearby-target DEmRNA interaction networks were constructed.
   Receiver operating characteristic and survival analysis were performed.
   A published dataset were as used to validate the result of
   bioinformatics analysis.
   RESULTS: We obtained 1103 DEmRNAs and 306 DElncRNAs between LSCC and
   adjacent tissues. A total of 338 DElncRNA-DEmRNA co-expression pairs and
   229 DElncRNA-nearby-target DEmRNA pairs were obtained. Ten DElncRNAs and
   six DEmRNAs has great diagnostic value for LSCC. HOXB9 has potential
   prognostic value for LSCC. The results of GSE84957 validation were
   generally consistent with our results.
   CONCLUSION: Our study provided clues for understanding the mechanism and
   developing potential biomarkers for LSCC.

AB BackgroundCurrent prognostic tools and targeted therapeutic approaches
   have limited value for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   Building upon current knowledge, we hypothesized that
   epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and related CYP450 epoxygenases may
   have differential roles in breast cancer signaling, and better
   understanding of which may uncover potential directions for molecular
   stratification and personalized therapy for TNBC patients.MethodsWe
   analyzed the oxylipin metabolome of paired tumors and adjacent normal
   mammary tissues from patients with pathologically confirmed breast
   cancer (N=62). We used multivariate statistical analysis to identify
   important metabolite contributors and to determine the predictive power
   of tumor tissue metabolite clustering. In vitro functional assays using
   a panel of breast cancer cell lines were carried out to further confirm
   the crucial roles of endogenous and exogenous EETs in the metastasis
   transformation of TNBC cells. Deregulation of associated downstream
   signaling networks associated with EETs/CYPs was established using
   transcriptomics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
   Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC).
   Comparative TNBC proteomics using the same tissue specimens subjected to
   oxylipin metabolomics analysis was used as validation
   set.ResultsMetabolite-by-metabolite comparison, tumor immunoreactivity,
   and gene expression analyses showed that CYP epoxygenases and
   arachidonic acid-epoxygenation products, EET metabolites, are strongly
   associated with TNBC metastasis. Notably, all the 4 EET isomers (5,6-,
   8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET) was observed to profoundly drive the
   metastasis transformation of mesenchymal-like TNBC cells among the TNBC
   (basal- and mesenchymal-like), HER2-overexpressing and luminal breast
   cancer cell lines examined. Our pathway analysis revealed that, in
   hormone-positive breast cancer subtype, CYP epoxygenase overexpression
   is more related to immune cell-associated signaling, while EET-mediated
   Myc, Ras, MAPK, EGFR, HIF-1, and NOD1/2 signaling are the molecular
   vulnerabilities of metastatic CYP epoxygenase-overexpressing TNBC
   tumors.ConclusionsThis study suggests that categorizing breast tumors
   according to their EET metabolite ratio classifiers and CYP epoxygenase
   profiles may be useful for prognostic and therapeutic assessment.
   Modulation of CYP epoxygenase and EET-mediated signaling networks may
   offer an effective approach for personalized treatment of breast cancer,
   and may be an effective intervention option for metastatic TNBC
   patients.

AB Family with sequence similarity 83 member B (FAM83B) has been recently
   identified as an oncogene involved in the development of various human
   cancers. However, the role of FAM83B in endometrial cancer tumorigenesis
   and metastasis is unclear. In this study, we found that the expression
   of FAM83B was upregulated in endometrial cancer tissues and cell lines.
   FAM83B expression in endometrial cancer tissues was significantly higher
   than that in normal tissues and higher FAM83B expression was closely
   related to poorly survival rate according to TCGA analysis. Moreover,
   FAM83B expression was correlated with International Federation of
   Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)stage and myometrial invasion but had no
   significant correlation with age or histological grade. FAM83B knockdown
   inhibited endometrial cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
   arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S stage and promoted apoptosis. FAM83B
   knockdown also inhibited endometrial cancer growth and lung metastasis
   in vivo. FAM83B knockdown silenced the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and
   promoted autophagy. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
   reversed FAM83B knockdown-induced autophagy promotion and inhibition of
   proliferation, migration, and invasion in endometrial cancer cells.
   Taken together, these results indicate that FAM83B promotes endometrial
   cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting autophagy via
   activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

AB Chromosomal instability (CIN) of gastric cancer is correlated with

   tomography (CT) imaging traits in predicting the CIN status of gastric
   cancer. We screened 443 patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas gastric
   cancer cohort to filter 40 patients with complete CT imaging and genomic
   data as the training cohort. CT imaging traits were subjected to
   logistic regression to select independent predictors for the CIN status.
   For the validation cohort, we prospectively enrolled 18 gastric cancer
   patients for CT and tumor genomic analysis. The imaging predictors were
   tested in the validation cohort using receiver operating characteristic
   curve (ROC) analysis. Thirty patients (75%) in the training cohort and 9
   patients (50%) in the validation cohort had CIN subtype gastric cancers.
   Smaller tumor diameter (p = 0.017) and acute tumor transition angle (p =
   0.045) independently predict CIN status in the training cohort. In the
   validation cohort, acute tumor transition angle demonstrated the highest
   accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 88.9%, 88.9%, and 88.9%,
   respectively, and areas under ROC curve of 0.89. In conclusion, this
   pilot study showed acute tumor transition angle on CT images may predict
   the CIN status of gastric cancer.

AB Cancer-testis (CT) genes are a group of genes restrictedly expressed in
   testis and multiple cancers and can serve as candidate driver genes
   participating in the development of cancers. Our previous study
   identified a number of CT genes in nongerm cell tumors, but their
   expression pattern in testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), a cancer type
   characterized by less genomic alterations, remained largely unknown. In
   this study, we systematically investigated the expression pattern of CT
   genes in TGCT samples and evaluated the transcriptome difference between
   TGCT and normal testis tissues, using datasets from the UCSC Xena
   platform, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue
   Expression (GTEx) project. Pathway enrichment analysis and survival
   analysis were conducted to evaluate the biological function and
   prognostic effect of expressed CT genes. We identified that 1036
   testis-specific expressedprotein-coding genes and 863 testis-specific
   expressedlong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were expressed in TGCT samples,
   including 883 CT protein-coding genes and 710 CT lncRNAs defined
   previously. The number of expressed CT genes was significantly higher in
   seminomas (P=3.48*10-13 ) which were characterized by frequent mutations
   in driver genes (KIT, KRAS and NRAS). In contrast, the number of
   expressed CT genes showed a moderate negative correlation with the
   fraction of copy number altered genomes (cor=-0.28, P=1.20*10-3 ).
   Unlike other cancers, our analysis revealed that 96.16% of the CT genes
   were down-regulated in TGCT samples, while CT genes in stem cell
   maintenance related pathways were up-regulated. Further survival
   analysis provided evidence that CT genes could also predict the
   prognosis of TGCT patients with both disease-free interval and
   progression-free interval as clinical endpoints. Taken together, our
   study provided a global view of CT genes in TGCT and provided evidence
   that CT genes played important roles in the progression and maintenance
   of TGCT.

AB OBJECT: Cancer recurrence is a complicated problem for clinicians that
   contributes to poor prognosis. Therefore, predicting increased risk of
   recurrence could help identify patients in need of adjuvant therapy to
   improve prognosis.
   METHODS: In the current study, we used bioinformatics analysis to
   predict gastric carcinoma recurrence.
   RESULTS: We discovered that Collagen type IV alpha 1 (COL4A1) expression
   was over-expressed in gastric carcinomas tissue by analyzing gene
   expression profiles of GSE2685 from GEO database. We also demonstrated
   that COL4A1 was over-expressed in gastric carcinoma tissue from the TCGA
   dataset and further determined that higher CLO4A1 expression had poorer
   overall survival time. Univariate analysis suggested that COL4A1 was
   strongly correlated with T stage and gastric carcinoma recurrence
   (p=0.014 and p=0.041). Moreover, multiple logistic regression analysis
   indicated that COL4A1 was significantly associated with gastric
   carcinoma recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 1.605, 95% confidence interval
   (CI), 1.063-2.677, p=0.008).
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CLO4A1 may promote gastric
   carcinoma recurrence and could potentially be used as a therapeutic
   target for gastric carcinoma recurrence. This article is protected by

AB Cyclin E2, a member of the cyclin family, is a key cell cycle-related
   protein. This protein plays essential roles in cancer progression, and,
   as such, an inhibitor of cyclin E2 has been approved to treat several
   types of cancers. Even so, mechanisms underlying how to regulate cyclin
   E2 expression in cancer remain largely unknown. In the current study,
   miR-3687 was upregulated in clinical bladder cancer (BC) tumor tissues,
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and human BC cell lines.
   Inhibition of miR-3687 expression significantly reduced human BC cell
   proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, which coincided with
   the induction of G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and downregulation of
   cyclin E2 protein expression. Interestingly, overexpression of cyclin E2
   reversed the inhibition of BC proliferation induced by miR-3687.
   Mechanistic studies suggested that miR-3687 binds to the 3' UTR of foxp1
   mRNA, downregulates FOXP1 protein expression, and in turn promotes the
   transcription of cyclin E2, thereby promoting the growth of BC cells.
   Collectively, the current study not only establishes a novel regulatory
   axis of miR-3687/FOXP1 regarding regulation of cyclin E2 expression in
   BC cells, but also provides strong suggestive evidence that miR-3687 and
   FOXP1 may be promising targets in therapeutic strategies for human BC.

AB The stromal reaction in pancreatic cancer creates a physical barrier
   that blocks therapeutic intervention and creates an immunosuppressive
   tumor microenvironment. The Rho/myocardin-related transcription factor
   (MRTF) pathway is implicated in the hyper-activation of fibroblasts in

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a severe health issue worldwide,
   especially in Asia. To date, molecular classifications proposed for the
   overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) prediction of
   Asian HCC patients after hepatectomy are quite few and limited in
   clinical practice. Here, we established a molecular subtyping system for
   Asian HCC to facilitate prognosis evaluation. Firstly, differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR [false discovery rate] < 0.05) between
   different types of liver cancer and non-tumor tissue were screened.
   Among the DEGs solely between HCC and non-tumor samples, 185 genes
   simultaneously significantly associated with the OS and RFS were
   identified as HCC-characteristic genes. The molecular subtypes were
   developed based on the expression profiles of the 185 genes in the
   training dataset (TCGA [The Cancer Genome Atlas] dataset) using
   non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering method. Patients were
   then classified into Subtype1 and Subtype2 groups denoting unfavorable
   and favorable clinical outcome respectively. The robustness and
   effectiveness of the molecular subtype was confirmed in another
   independent dataset (GSE14520) by the same clustering approach and
   Kaplan-Meier analyses. Moreover, functional prediction analysis revealed
   that the identified molecular signature was involved in chemotaxis,
   apoptosis and cell development associated pathways. Besides, the
   molecular signature was closely related to the clinical characteristics
   including TNM stage, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and TP53
   mutation. Furthermore, integration of the molecular subtype and TNM
   stage was demonstrated to improve risk stratification. Taken together,
   our molecular subtyping system exhibited great utility and potential in
   prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision making of Asian HCC
   patients.

AB It is well established that the PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog)
   mutant is a frequently mutated gene found in clear cell renal cell
   carcinoma (ccRCC), making it a potential biomarker for individualized
   treatment opinions. Here, in the present study, we designed a method to
   evaluate the significance of the PTEN mutation in the prognosis and drug
   selection of ccRCC, determine the potential changing pathways and genes
   associated with the mechanisms. The most recent TCGA data shows that the
   PTEN mutation is found in 5% of ccRCC patients. In total, 2,569 genes
   were identified as DEGs. GO and KEGG analysis suggested that DEGs were
   significantly enriched in categories associated with cell division and
   multiple metabolic progressions. The top 10 genes, ranked by degree,
   were identified as hub genes from the protein-protein interaction
   network (PPI). What is more, patients with the PTEN mutation were
   associated with a worsened prognosis of ccRCC. Data from the GDSC
   database indicated that the selective AKT inhibitor, GSK690693, is a
   selective inhibitor for ccRCC with the PTEN mutation. Our findings have
   indicated that multiple genes and pathways may play a crucial role in
   PTEN mutation ccRCC, offering candidate targets and strategies for PTEN
   mutation ccRCC individualized treatment.

AB Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare,
   heterogeneous neuroendocrine neoplasms of the autonomous nervous system
   of chromaffin cell origin that may arise within the adrenal medulla
   (PCCs) or the sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia (PGLs).
   Currently referred to by the umbrella term
   pheochromocytomas-paragangliomas (PPGLs), these distinct tumors are
   characterized by specific histopathology as well as biological and
   clinical profiles. PPGLs may occur as part of hereditary syndromes (40%
   of cases) or as sporadic tumors. Currently, there are 12 different
   hereditary syndromes with characteristic genetic abnormalities, at least
   15 well-characterized driver genes and distinct tumor metabolic
   pathways. Based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) taxonomic schemata,
   PPGLs have been classified into three main clusters of specific genetic
   mutations and tumor pathways with clinical, biochemical, and prognostic
   implications. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the initial diagnosis,
   tumor characterization, evaluation of treatment response, and long-term
   surveillance. While MDCT and MRI help in the anatomic localization,
   SPECT, and PET using different radiotracers are crucial in the
   functional assessment of these tumors. Surgery, chemotherapy, and
   radiotherapy are currently available treatment options for PPGLs;
   antiangiogenic drugs are also being used in treating metastatic disease.
   Evolving knowledge regarding the different genetic abnormalities
   involved in the pathogenesis of PPGLs has identified potential
   therapeutic targets that may be utilized in the discovery of novel
   drugs.

AB Sarcomatoid urothelial bladder cancer (SARC) displays a high propensity
   for distant metastasis and is associated with short survival. We report
   a comprehensive genomic analysis of 28 cases of SARC and 84 cases of
   conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC), with the TCGA cohort of 408
   muscleinvasive bladder cancers serving as the reference. SARCs show a
   distinct mutational landscape, with enrichment of TP53, RB1, and PIK3CA
   mutations. They are related to the basal molecular subtype of
   conventional UCs and could be divided into epithelial-basal and more
   clinically aggressive mesenchymal subsets on the basis of TP63 and its
   target gene expression levels. Other analyses reveal that SARCs are
   driven by downregulation of homotypic adherence genes and dysregulation
   of the EMT network, and nearly half exhibit a heavily infiltrated immune
   phenotype. Our observations have important implications for
   prognostication and the development of more effective therapies for this
   highly lethal variant of bladder cancer.

AB Zinc finger protein 671 (ZNF671) is a member of the largest
   transcription factor family in the human genome. However, the
   methylation status, expression, and prognostic role of ZNF671 in solid
   tumors remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the
   relationship between ZNF671 and the prognosis of patients with solid
   tumors. We performed a pan-cancer analysis of the methylation status and
   mRNA and protein expression of ZNF671 using The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database and the Human Protein Atlas. We further evaluated the
   prognostic value of ZNF671 expression among numerous cancer types using
   the "Kaplan-Meier plotter" (KM plotter) database. We found that
   downregulation of ZNF671 is associated with hypermethylation of its
   promoter. Survival analysis established that the downregulation of
   ZNF671 predicts poor prognosis in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA),
   cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC),
   head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney renal papillary
   cell carcinoma (KIRP), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), pancreatic
   adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC)
   solid tumors. CCK-8 and Transwell functional assays showed that ZNF671
   could inhibit tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These
   results indicate that ZNF671 is an excellent predictive factor for BRCA,
   CESC, HNSC, KIRP, LUAD, PAAD, SARC, and UCEC solid tumors and may play
   crucial roles in the development and progression of these tumors.

AB BACKGROUND
   The methylated septin 9 (mSEPT9) assay was the first blood-based test
   approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a
   colorectal screening test. However, the diagnostic and prognostic role
   of preoperative mSEPT9 for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Chinese patients
   is still unknown.
   AIM
   To improve the understanding of diagnostic and prognostic factors, serum
   mSEPT9 was detected in Chinese CRC patients.
   METHODS
   A retrospective analysis of 354 cases, of which 300 had CRC and 54 were
   normal, was performed in China. Patients characteristics, treatments,
   and laboratory data, including age, the date of surgery, Union for
   International Cancer Control (UICC) stages, distant metastasis (M), and
   so on, were collected. Methylation levels of SEPT9 were quantified by
   quantitative, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction before
   surgery. In addition, the effects of mSEPT9 on the occurrence and
   prognosis of 330 CRC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database
   were evaluated using bioinformatics analyses. Potential prognostic
   factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)
   were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis.
   RESULTS
   In Chinese CRC patients, positive mSEPT9 was strongly associated with
   advanced UICC stages, deeper invasion by the primary tumor, and more
   distant metastasis. Methylation levels of SEPT9 were stage-dependent and
   showed a stepwise increase in UICC stages (I-IV), primary tumor
   categories (T1-T4), regional node categories (N0-N2), and distant
   metastasis categories (M0-M1). The patients with positive mSEPT9 showed
   a tendency toward lower PFS. After analyzing TCGA clinical data, the
   high mSEPT9 group was found to be obviously correlated only with more
   distant metastasis. The patients with high mSEPT9 levels showed a
   tendency toward lower OS. Besides, nine meaningful mSEPT9 sites were
   found to provide guidance for the follow-up studies.
   CONCLUSION
   MSEPT9 analysis may add valuable information to current tumor staging.
   Serum mSEPT9 in Chinese CRC patients appears to offer promising novel
   prognostic markers and might be considered for monitoring CRC
   recurrence.

AB Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and shows
   resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors which have been demonstrated
   to be effective in many other types of cancers. Pre-existing T-cell
   response in tumor microenvironment often determines the therapeutic
   benefit of immune checkpoint blockade. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells
   are considered as the major effector immune cells in antitumor immunity.
   In this study, we aimed to identify the intrinsic oncogenic pathway that
   contributes to a reduction of CD8+ T-cell infiltration in colorectal
   cancer. To achieve this, human colon adenocarcinoma samples derived from
   The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA) were stratified into low T-cell-inflamed
   and high T-cell-inflamed groups based on the expression of T-cell
   signature genes. Gene set enrichment analysis of revealed a close
   correlation between activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway
   and absence of T-cell infiltration. By immunohistochemical analysis of
   155 colorectal cancer tissues, we found that tumors with high
   beta-catenin expression showed a significant reduction of CD8+ T-cell
   infiltration. Mechanistically, beta-catenin can regulate CCL4 expression
   to recruit CD103+ dendritic cells to enable CD8+ T cell activation.
   Collectively, our data indicate that oncogenic beta-catenin signal may
   mediate colorectal cancer resistance to immunotherapies, pointing to the
   combined PD-1-immunotherapy with targeting beta-catenin in colorectal
   cancer.

   MiRNAs are a type of small noncoding RNA that can regulate various

   In this study, we found that miR-128-3p could suppress cellular
   proliferation and motility abilities of breast cancer. In addition, we
   found that overexpression of miR-128-3p arrested breast cancer cells in
   G0/G1 phase by affecting expression of CDK4/CDK6/Cyclin D1 and
   CDK2/Cyclin E1. Furthermore, we confirmed that LIM domain kinase 1
   (LIMK1) is a direct target gene of miR-128-3p and that overexpression of
   miR-128-3p could suppress the expression levels of LIMK1 and Cofilin 1,
   which is downstream of LIMK1. TCGA clinical database showed that
   miR-128-3p was highly expressed in breast cancer patients and that high
   expression of miR-128-3p indicates a better prognosis of breast cancer.
   Our findings demonstrated that miR-128-3p could regulate cellular
   progression of breast cancer via regulating the LIMK1/CFL1 signaling
   pathway, and this new avenue could broaden existing versions of
   molecular mechanisms in breast cancer and perhaps represent potential
   novel direction of breast cancer treatment in the future.

AB It has been observed that both cancer tissue cells and normal
   proliferating cells (NPCs) have the Warburg effect. Our goal here is to
   demonstrate that they do this for different reasons. To accomplish this,
   we have analyzed the transcriptomic data of over 7000 cancer and control
   tissues of 14 cancer types in TCGA and data of five NPC types in GEO.
   Our analyses reveal that NPCs accumulate large quantities of ATPs
   produced by the respiration process before starting the Warburg effect,
   to raise the intracellular pH from 6.8 to 7.2 and to prepare for cell
   division energetically. Once cell cycle starts, the cells start to rely
   on glycolysis for ATP generation followed by ATP hydrolysis and lactic
   acid release, to maintain the elevated intracellular pH as needed by
   cell division since together the three processes are pH neutral. The
   cells go back to the normal respiration-based ATP production once the
   cell division phase ends. In comparison, cancer cells have reached their
   intracellular pH at 7.4 from top down as multiple acid-loading
   transporters are up-regulated and most acid-extruding ones except for
   lactic acid exporters are repressed. Cancer cells use continuous
   glycolysis for ATP production as way to acidify the intracellular space
   since the lactic acid secretion is decoupled from glycolysis-based ATP
   generation and is pH balanced by increased expressions of acid-loading
   transporters. Co-expression analyses suggest that lactic acid secretion
   is regulated by external, non-pH related signals. Overall, our data
   strongly suggest that the two cell types have the Warburg effect for
   very different reasons.

AB Ubiquitination is one of the main post-translational modification of
   proteins. It plays key roles in a broad range of cellular functions,
   including protein degradation, protein interactions, and subcellular
   location. In the ubiquitination system, different proteins are involved
   and their dysregulation can lead to various human diseases, including
   cancers. By using data available from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
   the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases, we here show that the
   ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, E2C (UBE2C), is overexpressed in all 27
   cancers we investigated. UBE2C expression is significantly higher in
   late-stage tumors, which might indicate its involvement in tumor
   progression and invasion. This study also revealed that patients with
   higher UBE2C levels showed a shorter overall survival (OS) time and
   worse OS prognosis. Moreover, our data show that UBE2C higher-expression
   leads to worse disease-free survival prognosis (DFS), indicating that
   UBE2C overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes. We also
   identified genes with positive correlations with UBE2C in several
   cancers. We found a number of poorly studied genes (family with sequence
   similarity 72-member D, FAM72D; meiotic nuclear divisions 1, MND1;
   mitochondrial fission regulator 2, MTFR2; and POC1 centriolar protein A,
   POC1A) whose expression correlates with UBE2C. These genes might be
   considered as new targets for cancers therapies since they showed
   overexpression in several cancers and correlate with worse OS prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of
   cancer mortality and without effective prognosis. Previous study has
   been confirmed that the abnormal expressionof long non-coding RNAs
   (lncRNAs) TGFB2-AS1 wasinvolved in tumorigenesis. However, the
   biological functions of TGFB2-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   remain largely unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: We comprehensively assess the clinical significance of
   TGFB2-AS1 and investigate the biological functions of TGFB2-AS1 on HCC
   HepG2 cells.
   METHODS: We firstly confirmed the expression of TGFB2-AS1 between tumor
   and normal tissues using public available transcriptome data. We
   analyzed the clinical significance of TGFB2-AS1 using the TCGA HCC
   datasets. The biological functions of TGFB2-AS1 on HCC HepG2 cells were
   explored by multiple in vitro assays.
   RESULTS: We found that TGFB2-AS1 was remarkably increased in HCC tissues
   (P=0.00148) and exhibited a potential predictive marker for HCC, with an
   area under curve (AUC) of 0.708 (P=0.0034) using the fifty pairs of
   matched HCC tissues of TCGA. Besides, higher expression of TGFB2-AS1 in
   HCC tissues was identified as being positively associated with advanced
   tumor (P=0.012) and disease stage (P=0.009) in 355 HCC cases using
   independent sample nonparametric test. Downregulation of TGFB2-AS1
   expression significantly restrained proliferation (P<0.01) and impaired
   colony formation (P<0.05). Furthermore, TGFB2-AS1 depletion remarkably
   promoted theapoptosis of HepG2 cells (P<0.05) and inhibited migration
   and invasion (P<0.01).
   CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings suggested that TGFB2-AS1
   might serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

AB Merlin/NF2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor whose mutations underlie
   inherited tumor syndrome neuro-fibromatosis type 2 (NF2), as well as
   various sporadic cancers including kidney cancer. Multiple Merlin/NF2
   effector pathways including the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway have been
   identified. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the growth
   and survival of NF2-mutant tumors remain poorly understood. Using an
   inducible orthotopic kidney tumor model, we demonstrate that YAP/TAZ
   silencing is sufficient to induce regression of pre-established
   NF2-deficient tumors. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ depletion diminishes
   glycolysis-dependent growth and increases mitochondria! respiration and
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) buildup, resulting in
   oxidativestress-induced cell death when challenged by nutrient stress.
   Furthermore, we identify lysosome-mediated cAMP-PKA/EPAC-dependent
   activation of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling as a resistance mechanism to YAP/TAZ
   inhibition. Finally, unbiased analysis of TCGA primary kidney tumor
   transcrip-tomes confirms a positive correlation of a YAP/TAZ signature
   with glycolysis and inverse correlations with oxidative phosphorylation
   and lysosomal gene expression, supporting the clinical relevance of our
   findings.

AB The limb-bud and heart development (LBH) gene is a highly conserved,
   tissue-specific transcription cofactor in vertebrates that regulates
   multiple key genes in embryonic development. The role of LBH in various
   cancer types is still controversial, and its specific role and molecular
   mechanism in the oncogenesis of gastric cancer (GC) remains largely
   unexplored. In the present study, the prognostic significance and
   clinicopathological characteristics of LBH in GC was determined. The LBH
   mRNA expression was first investigated in four independent public
   datasets (TCGA-STAD, GSE15459, GSE29272, and GSE62254) and then
   validated with our samples at the protein level. LBH was overexpressed
   at both the mRNA and protein levels in cancer compared with normal
   tissues. High LBH expression was correlated with advanced T, N, and M
   stages. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test indicated that higher
   LBH expression was statistically correlated with shorter overall
   survival (OS) in the public datasets and our study samples. Univariate
   and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that LBH was an
   independent prognostic biomarker for survival in TCGA-STAD, GSE15459,
   GSE62254 cohorts, and our GC patients. In vitro experiments showed that
   knockdown of LBH can significantly inhibit the proliferation and
   invasion of HGC-27 cells, while overexpression of LBH can significantly
   enhance the proliferation and invasion of BGC-823 cells. Gene Set
   Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
   Genes and Genomics (KEGG) indicated that high LBH expression is
   associated with the PI3K-Akt pathway, focal adhesion, and extracellular
   matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. Western blot analysis showed that
   knockdown of LBH significantly inhibited the expression of integrin
   alpha 5, integrin beta 1, p-FAK, and p-Akt. Therefore, results from the
   present study indicate that LBH is a potential independent prognostic
   biomarker and promotes proliferation and invasion of GC cells by
   activating the integrin/FAK/Akt pathway.

AB BackgroundIn this era of precision medicine, the DNA damage response
   (DDR) pathway has been shown to be a viable target of intervention in
   metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as approximately
   one-third of CRPC patients harbor DDR pathway mutations. To determine
   whether DDR pathway is a potential therapeutic target in localized
   disease, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in the present
   study.MethodsTCGA is a publically available cancer genome database that
   is sponsored by the United States National Cancer Institute. Total of
   455 cases were available in the database at the time of this
   analysis.ResultsDDR pathway gene mutations or copy number alterations
   were present in 136 (29.9%) of the 455 cases. On a univariate analysis,
   DDR pathway status did not correlate with serum prostate specific
   antigen, tumor stage or grade. However, among patients with high-risk
   features post-operatively (pathologic stage T3, Gleason score8, or
   PSA>20ng/ml), DDR pathway alteration was associated with a lower overall
   survival (p=0.0291).ConclusionsCollectively these results suggest that
   DDR pathway alterations may also be significant in localized prostate
   cancer and agents such as PARP inhibitors should be considered in
   patients with a high-risk disease.

AB Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) has an important function of scavenging
   hydrogen peroxide and preventing cancer. The purpose of this
   meta-analysis was to analyze the relationship between GPX3 gene
   methylation and cancer and to further evaluate its diagnostic value for
   cancer. We screened eligible literatures from the PubMed, Embase, CNKI
   and Wanfang databases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
   (95% CIs) were used to measure the association of GPX3 methylation with
   cancer. Summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis was
   used to assess the diagnostic value of GPX3 methylation for cancer. A
   total of 17 eligible articles were included in the meta-analysis
   involving a total of 960 tumor samples and 445 non-tumor samples. The
   results showed that GPX3 hypermethylation was significantly associated
   with cancer (OR=17.32, 95% CI=8.22-36.51, P< 0.00001). Compared with
   cancer patients without lymph node metastasis, cancer patients with
   lymph node metastasis were more associated with GPX3 hypermethylation
   (OR=2.97, 95% CI=1.53-5.76, P= 0.001). SROC analysis showed for GPX3
   methylation was a promising biomarker for cancer risk (AUC=0.89, pooled
   sensitivity=0.93, pooled specificity=0.54, NLR=0.15, PLR=2.05,
   DOR=17.32). TCGA database bioinformatics analysis of 696 pairs of tumor
   and non-tumor tissues further validate the association of GPX3
   methylation with the risk of cancer [cg21504918: 0.10 (0.08, 0.15) vs.
   0.09 (0.08, 0.11), P=5.8E-28; cg26638444: 0.05 (0.04, 011) vs. 0.04
   (0.03, 0.06), P=8.7E-29]. In summary, our study indicates that GPX3
   methylation is associated with cancer and has the potential to become a
   broad-spectrum tumor screening marker and has a value in predicting
   tumor lymph node metastasis.

   responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy and its mechanism remains
   poorly understood. We have investigated the effect of anti-PD-L1 and
   c-Myc inhibition in PDAC. Using 87 patients with PDAC from our hospital
   database we found a significant correlation between the expression of
   PD-L1 and c-Myc. Moreover, the expression of both PD-L1 and c-Myc was
   associated with poor overall survival. In addition, we confirmed this
   finding with the PDAC patients in the TCGA database. Using several PDAC
   cell lines we demonstrated a significant correlation between the
   expression of PD-L1 and c-Myc. We also found that expression of PD-L1
   correlated with high-grade histology. JQ1, an inhibitor of c-Myc
   inhibited PD-L1 expression and tumor growth. Using xenograft models, we
   demonstrated that the combination of JQ1 and anti-PD-L1 antibody exerted
   synergistic inhibition of PDAC growth. Our data demonstrated that the
   expression of PD-L1 and c-Myc may be helpful prognostic biomarkers, and
   their inhibition may potentially serve as an effective treatment for
   PDAC.

AB Cancer is a multifactorial condition with aberrant growth of cells. A
   substantial number of cancers, breast in particular, are hormone
   sensitive and evolve due to malfunction in the steroidogenic machinery.
   Breast cancer, one of the most prevalent form of cancers in women, is
   primarily stimulated by estrogens. Steroid hormones are made from
   cholesterol, and regulation of steroid/estrogen biosynthesis is
   essentially influenced by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR)
   protein. Although the impact of StAR in breast cancer remains a mystery,
   we recently reported that StAR protein is abundantly expressed in
   hormone sensitive breast cancer, but not in its non-cancerous
   counterpart. Herein, we analyzed genomic profiles, hormone receptor
   expression, mutation, and survival for StAR and steroidogenic enzyme
   genes in a variety of hormone sensitive cancers. These profiles were
   specifically assessed in breast cancer, exploiting The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Whereas StAR and key steroidogenic enzyme genes
   evaluated (CYP11A1, HSD3B, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, and HSD17B) were altered to
   varying levels in these hormone responsive cancers, amplification of the
   StAR gene was correlated with poor overall survival of patients
   afflicted with breast cancer. Amplification of the StAR gene and its
   correlation to survival was also verified in a number of breast cancer
   studies. Additionally, TCGA breast cancer tumors associated with
   aberrant high expression of StAR mRNA were found to be an unfavorable
   risk factor for survival of patients with breast cancer. Further
   analyses of tumors, nodal status, and metastases of breast cancer tumors
   expressing StAR mRNA displayed cancer deaths in stage specific manners.
   The majority of these tumors were found to express estrogen and
   progesterone receptors, signifying a link between StAR and luminal
   subtype breast cancer. Collectively, analyses of genomic and molecular
   profiles of key steroidogenic factors provide novel insights that StAR
   plays an important role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of
   hormone sensitive breast cancer.

AB BackgroundEndometrial cancer (EMCA) is the fifth most common cancer
   among women in the world. Identification of potentially pathogenic
   germline variants from individuals with EMCA will help characterize
   genetic features that underlie the disease and potentially predispose
   individuals to its pathogenesis.MethodsThe Geisinger Health System's
   (GHS) DiscovEHR cohort includes exome sequencing on over 50,000
   consenting patients, 297 of whom have evidence of an EMCA diagnosis in
   their electronic health record. Here, rare variants were annotated as
   potentially pathogenic.ResultsEight genes were identified as having
   increased burden in the EMCA cohort relative to the non-cancer control
   cohort. None of the eight genes had an increased burden in the other
   hormone related cancer cohort from GHS, suggesting they can help
   characterize the underlying genetic variation that gives rise to EMCA.
   Comparing GHS to the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) EMCA germline data
   illustrated 34 genes with potentially pathogenic variation and eight
   unique potentially pathogenic variants that were present in both
   studies. Thus, similar germline variation among genes can be observed in
   unique EMCA cohorts and could help prioritize genes to investigate for
   future work.ConclusionIn summary, this systematic characterization of
   potentially pathogenic germline variants describes the genetic
   underpinnings of EMCA through the use of data from a single hospital
   system.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary central
   nervous system malignant tumor. The median survival of GBM patients is
   12-15 months, and the 5 years survival rate is less than 5%. More novel
   molecular biomarkers are still urgently required to elucidate the
   mechanisms or improve the prognosis of GBM. This study aimed to explore
   novel biomarkers for GBM prognosis prediction. The gene expression
   profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus
   (GEO) datasets of GBM were downloaded. A total of 2241 overlapping
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from TCGA and
   GSE7696 datasets. By univariate COX regression survival analysis, 292
   survival-related genes were found among these DEGs (p < 0.05).
   Functional enrichment analysis was performed based on these
   survival-related genes. A five-gene signature (PTPRN, RGS14, G6PC3,
   IGFBP2, and TIMP4) was further selected by multivariable Cox regression
   analysis and a prognostic model of this five-gene signature was
   constructed. Based on this risk score system, patients in the high-risk
   group had significantly poorer survival results than those in the
   low-risk group. Moreover, with the assistance of GEPIA
   http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/, all five genes were found to be
   differentially expressed in GBM tissues compared with normal brain
   tissues. Furthermore, the co-expression network of the five genes was
   constructed based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis
   (WGCNA). Finally, this five-gene signature was further validated in
   other datasets. In conclusion, our study identified five novel
   biomarkers that have potential in the prognosis prediction of GBM.

AB YTH N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) is a core
   factor in RNA methylation modification. Recent studies have shown that
   m6A is closely related to multiple tumors, thus YTHDF1 may also play a
   role in tumorigenesis. This study, aimed to explore the role of YTHDF1
   in the colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we identified YTHDF1 as
   being highly expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in TCGA, GEO CRC
   and primary CRC. Furthermore, the YTHDF1 gene copy number was positively
   correlated with YTHDF1 mRNA expression in CRC. Knocking down the
   expression of YTHDF1 significantly inhibited the CRC cell's
   tumorigenicity in vitro and murine xenograft tumor growth in vivo.
   Furthermore, silencing of YTHDF1 inhibited the colonosphere formation
   ability in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that silencing YTHDF1
   significantly inhibited Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity in CRC cells.
   Together, YTHDF1 is overexpressed in CRC and plays a vital oncogenic
   role in CRC, and this novel finding may provide a potential therapeutic
   target for CRC.

AB Knowledge of the lung cancer genome has experienced rapid growth over
   the past decade. Genome-wide association studies and sequencing studies
   have identified dozens of genetic variants and somatic mutations
   implicated in the development of lung cancer in both Chinese and
   Caucasian populations. With the accumulating evidence, heterogeneities
   in lung cancer susceptibility were observed in different ethnicities. In
   this review, the progress on germline-based genetic variants and
   somatic-based genomic mutations associated with lung cancer and the
   differences between Chinese and Caucasian populations were
   systematically summarized. In the analysis of the genetic predisposition
   to lung cancer, 6 susceptibility loci were shared by Chinese and
   Caucasian populations (3q28, 5p15, 6p21, 9p21.3, 12q13.13 and 15q25), 14
   loci were specific to the Chinese population (1p36.32, 5q31.1, 5q32,
   6p21.1, 6q22.2, 6p21.32, 7p15.3, 10p14, 10q25.2, 12q23.1, 13q22,
   17q24.3, 20q13.2, and 22q12), and 12 loci were specific to the Caucasian
   population (1p31.1, 2q32.1, 6q27, 8p21.1, 8p12, 10q24.3, 11q23.3,
   12p13.33, 13q13.1, 15q21.1, 20q13.33 and 22q12.1). In the analysis of
   genomic and somatic alterations, different mutation rates were observed
   for EGFR (Chinese: 39-59% vs. TCGA: 14%), KRAS (Chinese: 7-11% vs. TCGA:
   31%), TP53 (Chinese: 44% vs. TCGA: 53%), CDKN2A (Chinese: 22% vs. TCGA:
   15%), NFE2L2 (Chinese: 28% vs. TCGA: 17%), STK11 (Chinese: 4-7% vs.
   TCGA: 16%), KEAP1 (Chinese: 3-5% vs. TCGA: 18%), and NF1 (Chinese: <2%
   vs. TCGA: 12%). In addition, frequently amplified regions encompassing
   genes involved in cytoskeletal organization or focal adhesion were
   identified only in Chinese patients. These results provide a
   comprehensive description of the genetic and genomic differences in lung
   cancer susceptibility between Chinese and Caucasian populations and may
   contribute to the development of precision medicine for lung cancer
   treatment and prevention.

AB BackgroundGenetic aberrations in DNA repair genes are linked to cancer,
   but less is reported about epigenetic regulation of DNA repair and
   functional consequences. We investigated the intragenic methylation loss
   at the three prime repair exonuclease 2 (TREX2) locus in laryngeal
   (n=256) and colorectal cancer cases (n=95) and in pan-cancer data from
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).ResultsSignificant methylation loss at an
   intragenic site of TREX2 was a frequent trait in both patient cohorts
   (p=0.016 and <0.001, respectively) and in 15 out of 22 TCGA studies.
   Methylation loss correlated with immunohistochemically staining for
   TREX2 (p<0.0001) in laryngeal tumors and improved overall survival of
   laryngeal cancer patients (p=0.045). Chromatin immunoprecipitation,
   demethylation experiments, and reporter gene assays revealed that the
   region of methylation loss can function as a CCAAT/enhancer binding
   protein alpha (CEBPA)-responsive enhancer element regulating TREX2
   expression.ConclusionsThe data highlight a regulatory role of TREX2 DNA
   methylation for gene expression which might affect incidence and
   survival of laryngeal cancer. Altered TREX2 protein levels in tumors may
   affect drug-induced DNA damage repair and provide new tailored
   therapies.

   RESULTS: PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3 were detected in TILs from 55%, 41.5% and
   25.3% of cases, respectively. These markers showed association with each
   other, but not with clinicopathologic variables and survival in cases
   without immunotherapy. The markers were lower in EGFR-mutated
   adenocarcinomas and partially associated with tumor-mutational burden.
   In single-cell CyTOF analysis, PD-1 and LAG-3 were predominantly
   localized on T/NKT-cells; while TIM-3 was higher in NK-cells and
   macrophages. Co-expression of PD-1,LAG-3 and TIM-3 was associated with
   T-cell activation, effector function and proliferation, but also with
   pro-apoptotic markers. LAG-3 and TIM-3 were present in TILs lacking PD-1
   and elevated baseline LAG-3 was associated with shorter progression-free
   survival after PD-1 axis blockade.
   CONCLUSIONS: PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3 have distinct tissue/cell
   distribution, functional implications and genomic correlates in NSCLC.
   Expression of these receptors is associated with activation, but also
   with pro-apoptotic T-cell phenotype. Elevated LAG-3 is associated with
   insensitivity to PD-1 blockade suggesting independence of these immune
   evasion pathways.

AB Survival analyses of gene expression data has been a useful and widely
   used approach in clinical applications. But, in complex diseases, such
   as cancer, the identification of survival-associated cell processes -
   rather than single genes -provides more informative results because the
   efficacy of survival prediction increases when multiple prognostic
   features are combined to enlarge the possibility of having druggable
   targets. Moreover, genome-wide screening in molecular medicine has
   rapidly grown, providing not only gene expression but also multi-omic
   measurements such as DNA mutations, methylation, expression, and copy
   number data. In cancer, virtually all these aberrations can contribute
   in synergy to pathological processes, and their measurements can improve
   a patient's outcome and help in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Here,
   we present MOSClip, an R package implementing a new topological pathway
   analysis tool able to integrate multi-omic data and look for
   survival-associated gene modules. MOSClip tests the survival association
   of dimensionality-reduced multi-omic data using multivariate models,
   providing graphical devices for management, browsing and interpretation
   of results. Using simulated data we evaluated MOSClip performance in
   terms of false positives and false negatives in different settings,
   while the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset is used as a case study to
   highlight MOSClip's potential.

AB BackgroundGene networks in living cells can change depending on various
   conditions such as caused by different environments, tissue types,
   disease states, and development stages. Identifying the differential
   changes in gene networks is very important to understand molecular basis
   of various biological process. While existing algorithms can be used to
   infer two gene networks separately from gene expression data under two
   different conditions, and then to identify network changes, such an
   approach does not exploit the similarity between two gene networks, and
   it is thus suboptimal. A desirable approach would be clearly to infer
   two gene networks jointly, which can yield improved estimates of network
   changes.ResultsIn this paper, we developed a proximal gradient algorithm
   for differential network (ProGAdNet) inference, that jointly infers two
   gene networks under different conditions and then identifies changes in
   the network structure. Computer simulations demonstrated that our
   ProGAdNet outperformed existing algorithms in terms of inference
   accuracy, and was much faster than a similar approach for joint
   inference of gene networks. Gene expression data of breast tumors and
   normal tissues in the TCGA database were analyzed with our ProGAdNet,
   and revealed that 268 genes were involved in the changed network edges.
   Gene set enrichment analysis identified a significant number of gene
   sets related to breast cancer or other types of cancer that are enriched
   in this set of 268 genes. Network analysis of the kidney cancer data in
   the TCGA database with ProGAdNet also identified a set of genes involved
   in network changes, and the majority of the top genes identified have
   been reported in the literature to be implicated in kidney cancer. These
   results corroborated that the gene sets identified by ProGAdNet were
   very informative about the cancer disease status. A software package
   implementing the ProGAdNet, computer simulations, and real data analysis
   is available as Additional file1.ConclusionWith its superior performance
   over existing algorithms, ProGAdNet provides a valuable tool for finding
   changes in gene networks, which may aid the discovery of gene-gene
   interactions changed under different conditions.

AB BackgroundEndocan, also known as endothelial cell specific molecule-1
   (ESM1), is a 50kDa soluble proteoglycan which is frequently
   overexpressed in many cancer types. Whether it is dysregulated in head
   and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has not been
   investigated.MethodsWe analyzed the expression of ESM1 using
   bioinformatics analysis based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA), and then validated that ESM1 was significantly overexpressed in
   human HNSCC at the protein level using immunohistochemistry. We also
   analyzed the genes co-expressed with ESM1 in HNSCC.ResultsThe most
   correlated gene was angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), a molecule which regulates
   physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Several transcription
   factor binding motifs including SMAD3, SMAD4, SOX3, SOX4, HIF2A and AP-1
   components were significantly enriched in the promoter regions of the
   genes co-expressed with ESM1. Further analysis based on ChIP-seq data
   from the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project revealed that
   AP-1 is an important regulator of ESM1 expression.ConclusionsOur results
   revealed a dysregulation of ESM1 and a potential regulatory mechanism
   for the co-expression network in HNSCC.

AB Inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal carcinomas (IBD-CRCs)
   develop in a background of chronic inflammation, and thus the molecular
   landscape of these tumors likely differs from that of sporadic
   colorectal cancer. To add to emerging data on molecular alterations
   present in these tumors, we analyzed our institution's cohort of
   IBD-CRCs. Colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) resected from patients with
   inflammatory bowel disease underwent molecular analysis via a 50-gene
   hot-spot solid tumor panel (OncoScreen ST2.0). In-house sporadic CRCs
   and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project data were used for
   comparison. Fifty-five IBD-CRCs from 48 patients were successfully
   analyzed. Mutations in TP53 were most common and were present in 69% of
   IBD-CRCs; a similar percentage of TP53 mutations were detected in
   sporadic colorectal carcinomas (70%). APC and KRAS mutations were
   significantly less common in IBD-CRCs than in sporadic CRCs (15% vs.
   53%, P<.001 and 20% vs. 38%, P=.02, respectively). Additionally, the
   potentially targetable IDH1 R132 mutation was present in 7% of IBD-CRCs
   but only 1% of sporadic CRCs and TCGA CRCs; alterations in other genes
   with potential targeted therapies were very rare. In conclusion,
   IBD-CRCs exhibit molecular differences when compared to sporadic CRCs,
   suggesting different pathways of carcinogenesis, though certain
   alterations are common to both types of tumors. IDH1 mutations are
   present in a subset of IBD-CRCs, which may expand therapeutic options in
   the future.

AB Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a new type of functional small RNAs
   involved in the chemical modifications of rRNAs, tRNAs, and small
   nuclear RNAs. It is reported that they play important roles in
   tumorigenesis via various regulatory modes. snoRNAs can both participate
   in the regulation of methylation and pseudouridylation and regulate the
   expression pattern of their host genes. This research investigated the
   expression pattern of snoRNAs in eight major cancer types in TCGA via
   several machine learning algorithms. The expression levels of snoRNAs
   were first analyzed by a powerful feature selection method, Monte Carlo
   feature selection (MCFS). A feature list and some informative features
   were accessed. Then, the incremental feature selection (IFS) was applied
   to the feature list to extract optimal features/snoRNAs, which can make
   the support vector machine (SVM) yield best performance. The
   discriminative snoRNAs included HBII-52-14, HBII-336, SNORD123,
   HBII-85-29, HBII-420, U3, HBI-43, SNORD116, SNORA73B, SCARNA4,
   HBII-85-20, etc., on which the SVM can provide a Matthew's correlation
   coefficient (MCC) of 0.881 for predicting these eight cancer types. On
   the other hand, the informative features were fed into the Johnson
   reducer and repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction
   (RIPPER) algorithms to generate classification rules, which can clearly
   show different snoRNAs expression patterns in different cancer types.
   The analysis results indicated that extracted discriminative snoRNAs can
   be important for identifying cancer samples in different types and the
   expression pattern of snoRNAs in different cancer types can be partly
   uncovered by quantitative recognition rules.

AB Objective: To investigate the expression and clinical significance of
   long non-coding RNA FOXD2-AS1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and
   its effect on cancer cell proliferation. Method: Real-time quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of
   FOXD2-AS1 in 85 cases of laryngeal carcinoma. One-way ANOVA was used to
   determine relationships between its expression and clinicopathological
   parameters of laryngeal carcinoma. The prognostic significance of
   FOXD2-AS1 in head and neck cancer was explored using bioinformatics
   technology. SiRNA was used to interfere the expression of FOXD2-AS1 in
   TU686 laryngeal carcinoma cells. MTT and clonal formation assay were
   used to investigate the biological effect of FOXD2-AS1. MicroRNA binding
   to FOXD2-AS1 was investigated using double luciferase assay. Result: The
   expression of FOXD2-AS1 in laryngeal cancer tissues was significantly
   higher than that in normal tissues(t=10.012, P<0.05), and was associated
   with T staging of laryngeal cancer(chi=6.41, P=0.016). There were no
   relationships between FOXD2-AS1 expression and age, sex, smoking
   history, primary site of tumor and lymph node metastasis(N staging).
   Survival analysis of head and neck tumors in the TCGA database using
   GEPIA showed poor prognosis in patients with high FOXD2-AS1
   expression(P=0.048). Suppressing FOXD2-AS1 via siRNA in TU686 cells
   decreased clonal formation ability(t=8.053, P<0.05) and MTT assay
   confirmed that interference of FOXD2-AS1 down regulated proliferation
   activity of TU686 cells(t=9.337, P<0.05). Double luciferase assay showed
   that FOXD2-AS1 could directly bind to miR-206, thus inhibiting the
   expression of miR-206. Further MTT assay indicated that inhibiting
   miR-206 attenuated the suppressing effect of si-FOXD2-AS1 on the
   proliferation of TU686 cells. Conclusion: FOXD2-AS1 is corelated with
   clinicopathological parameter of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and
   promotes cancer cell proliferation through targeting miR-206.

AB Background: Integrin-alpha 5 (ITGA5) gene has been reported to be
   critical for the progression of several cancers. However, the effects of
   ITGA5 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unclear.
   Methods: We firstly used bioinformatics methods to analyze the ITGA5
   gene expression based on the public dataset. HO1-N-1 and SCC-9 cells
   with silenced ITGA5 were constructed using siRNA. Then, we determined
   the biological functions of ITGA5 in OSCC cells using cell counting
   kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay and
   transwell assays. The expression of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, ERK and
   PERK were determined by western blot.
   Results: Our results revealed that ITGA5 expression was up-regulated in
   OSCC. The biological experiments further confirmed that ITGA5 expression
   was higher in OSCC cell lines. Moreover, we found that knockdown of
   ITGA5 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of OSCC cells.
   The expression of phosphorylated-(p) PI3K, p-AKT and p-ERK obviously
   decreased after knockdown of ITGA5 in OSCC cells.
   Conclusion: In summary, ITGA5 could promote the progression of OSCC via
   activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and it can be regarded as a
   potential biomarker for OSCC treatment.

AB BackgroundLipid metabolismreprogramming is a hallmark for tumor which
   contributes to tumorigenesis and progression, but the commonality and
   difference of lipid metabolism among pan-cancer is not fully
   investigated. Increasing evidences suggest that the alterations in tumor
   metabolism, including metabolite abundance and accumulation of metabolic
   products, lead to local immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.
   An integrated analysis of lipid metabolism in cancers from different
   tissues using multiple omics data may provide novel insight into the
   understanding of tumorigenesis and progression.ResultsThrough systematic
   analysis of the multiple omics data from TCGA, we found that the
   most-widely altered lipid metabolism pathways in pan-cancer are fatty
   acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism and
   PPAR signaling. Gene expression profiles of fatty acid metabolism show
   commonalities across pan-cancer, while the alteration in cholesterol
   metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism differ with tissue origin,
   suggesting tissue specific lipid metabolism features in different tumor
   types. An integrated analysis of gene expression, DNA methylation and
   mutations revealed factors that regulate gene expression, including the
   differentially methylated sites and mutations of the lipid genes, as
   well as mutation and differential expression of the up-stream
   transcription factors for the lipid metabolism pathways. Correlation
   analysis of the proportion of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment
   and the expression of lipid metabolism genes revealed immune-related
   differentially expressed lipid metabolic genes, indicating the potential
   crosstalk between lipid metabolism and immune response. Genes related to
   lipid metabolism and immune response that are associated with poor
   prognosis were discovered including HMGCS2, GPX2 and CD36, which may
   provide clues for tumor biomarkers or therapeutic targets.ConclusionsOur
   study provides an integrated analysis of lipid metabolism in pan-cancer,
   highlights the perturbation of key metabolism processes in tumorigenesis
   and clarificates the regulation mechanism of abnormal lipid metabolism
   and effects of lipid metabolism on tumor immune microenvironment. This
   study also provides new clues for biomarkers or therapeutic targets of
   lipid metabolism in tumors.

AB Hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) overexpression leads to
   activation of angiogenic pathways. However, little is known about the
   association between HIF-2 alpha expression and anti-tumor immunity in
   clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We aimed to explore how HIF-2
   alpha influenced the microenvironment and the underlying mechanisms.
   We immunohistochemically evaluated immune cells infiltrations and
   prognostic value of HIF-2 alpha expression in a retrospective Zhongshan
   Hospital cohort of 280 ccRCC patients. Fresh tumor samples, non-tumor
   tissues and autologous peripheral blood for RT-PCR, ELISA and flow
   cytometry analyses were collected from patients who underwent
   nephrectomy in Zhongshan Hospital from September 2017 to April 2018. The
   TCGA KIRC cohort and SATO cohort were assessed to support our findings.
   We demonstrated that ccRCC patients with HIF-2 alpha(high) tumors
   exhibited reduced overall survival (p = 0.025) and recurrence-free
   survival (p < 0.001). Functions of CD8(+) T cells were impaired in HIF-2
   alpha(high) patients. In ccRCC patients, HIF-2 alpha induced the
   expression of stem cell factor (SCF), which served as chemoattractant
   for mast cells. Tumor infiltrating mast cells impaired anti-tumor
   immunity partly by secreting IL-10 and TGF-beta. HIF-2 alpha mRNA level
   adversely associated with immunostimulatory genes expression in KIRC and
   SATO cohorts.
   HIF-2 alpha contributed to evasion of anti-tumor immunity via SCF
   secretion and subsequent recruitment of mast cells in ccRCC patients.

AB Purpose: To identify deregulated and inhibitory miRNAs and generate
   novel mimics for replacement nanomedicine for head and neck squamous
   cell carcinomas (HNSCC).
   Experimental Design: We integrated miRNA and mRNA expression, copy
   number variation, and DNA methylation results from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA), with a functional genome-wide screen.
   Results: We reveal that the miR-30 family is commonly repressed, and all
   5 members sharing these seed sequence similarly inhibit HNSCC
   proliferation in vitro. We uncover a previously unrecognized inverse
   relationship with overexpression of a network of important predicted
   target mRNAs deregulated in HNSCC, that includes key molecules involved
   in proliferation (EGFR, MET, IGF1R, IRS1, E2F7), differentiation (WNT7B,
   FZD2), adhesion, and invasion (ITGA6, SER-PINE1). Reexpression of the
   most differentially repressed family member, miR-30a-5p, suppressed this
   mRNA program, selected signaling proteins and pathways, and inhibited
   cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, a
   novel miR-30a-5p mimic formulated into a targeted nanomedicine
   significantly inhibited HNSCC xenograft tumor growth and target growth
   receptors EGFR and MET in vivo. Significantly decreased miR-30a/e family
   expression was related to DNA promoter hypermethylation and/or copy loss
   in TCGA data, and clinically with decreased disease-specific survival in
   a validation dataset. Strikingly, decreased miR-30e-5p distinguished
   oropharyngeal HNSCC with poor prognosis in TCGA (P = 0.002) and
   validation (P = 0.007) datasets, identifying a novel candidate biomarker
   and target for this HNSCC subset.
   Conclusions: We identify the miR-30 family as an important regulator of
   signal networks and tumor suppressor in a subset of HNSCC patients,
   which may benefit from miRNA replacement nanomedicine therapy.

AB Increasing evidence showed that Cadmium (Cd) can accumulate in the body
   and damage cells, resulting in cancerigenesis of the prostate with
   complex mechanisms. In the present study, we aimed to explore the
   possible key genes, pathways and therapeutic drugs using bioinformatics
   methods. Microarray-based data were retrieved and analyzed to screen
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Cd-treated prostate cells
   and controls. Then, functions of the DEGs were annotated and hub genes
   were screened. Next, key genes were selected from the hub genes via
   validation in a prostate cancer cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA). Afterward, potential drugs were further predicted. Consequently,
   a gene expression profile, GSE9951, was retrieved. Then, 361
   up-regulated and 30 down-regulated DEGs were screened out, which were
   enriched in various pathways. Among the DEGs, seven hub genes (HSPA5,
   HSP90AB1, RHOA, HSPD1, MAD2L1, SKP2, and CCT2) were dys-regulated in
   prostate cancer compared to normal controls, and two of them (HSPD1 and
   CCT2) might influence the prostate cancer prognosis. Lastly, ionomycin
   was predicted to be a potential agent reversing Cd-induced prostate cell
   malignant transformation. In summary, the present study provided novel
   evidence regarding the mechanisms of Cd-induced prostate cell malignant
   transformation, and identified ionomycin as a potential small molecule
   against Cd toxicity.

   of S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2) gene inhibition by
   lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) on the cell cycle, apoptosis
   and proliferation of endometrial carcinoma HEC-1-A cells. A lentivirus
   shRNA vector targeting Skp2 was constructed and transfected into HEC-1-A
   cells. HEC-1-A cells transfected with a scramble sequence were used as
   negative controls. The mRNA and protein expression of Skp2, p27, cyclin
   D1 and caspase-3 were detected via reverse transcription-quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The
   effects of Skp2 inhibition on the cell cycle, apoptosis and
   proliferation of HEC-1-A cells were detected using flow cytometry and a
   cell counting kit-8. Skp2 co-expression data was analyzed using Oncomine
   and TCGA databases. The positive recombinant viral clones were
   identified via PCR and confirmed via sequencing. The mRNA and protein
   expression of Skp2 were significantly decreased in HEC-1-A cells
   transfected with the lentiviral vectors compared with the negative
   control. In addition, there were no significant changes in the mRNA
   expression of p27 and cyclin D1; however, the protein levels of p27 and
   cyclin D1 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in HEC-1-A
   cells transfected with lentiviral vectors compared with negative
   controls. RNAi-induced Skp2 inhibition exerted an anti-proliferative
   effect by inducing cell cycle arrest, however cell apoptosis was not
   significantly affected. In the TCGA database, Skp2 expression positively
   associated with IGF2R, IGF2BP3, IGFBP1 and CCNF, while Skp2 expression
   negatively associated with IGF2, IGFBP6, IGFBP7 and IGFBP3. RNAi-induced
   Skp2 inhibition upregulated the protein expression of p27 and
   downregulated the protein expression of cyclin D1. The expression of
   Skp2 in endometrial cancer may therefore be regulated by the
   insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor signaling pathway.

AB Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs leads to a poor prognosis in

   between pituitary homeobox paired homeodomain transcription 1 (PITX1)
   expression and the sensitivity of GC cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs
   5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP). In the present study, the
   gastric cancer cell lines GES-1, AGS, BGC-823, MCG-803 and SGC-7901 were
   used. The expression of PITX1 was determined via reverse
   transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in GC cell lines.
   AGS and BGC-823 cells, which exhibit a decreased PITX1 expression, were
   transfected with a PITX1 cDNA construct and its control vector. MCG-803
   and SGC-7901 cells, which exhibit an increased PITX1 expression, were
   transfected with siRNA against PITX1 and its control scramble sequence.
   A Cell Counting kit-8 assay was performed to determine the impact of
   PITX1 expression on the sensitivity of GC cells to 5-FU and CDDP. The
   Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to analyze the expression of PITX1
   with GC prognosis in the Asian population and to assess the potential
   mechanism of PITX1 in 5-FU and CDDP resistance. The results revealed
   that the overexpression of PIXT1 increased the sensitivity of GC cells
   to 5-FU/CDDP. The combination of 5-FU/CDDP and PITX1 overexpression also
   reduced the proliferation of GC cells. Additionally, PIXT1 knockdown
   decreased the sensitivity of GC cells to 5-FU/CDDP. TCGA data revealed
   that a lower expression of PITX1 is exhibited in Asian GC patients than
   in normal individuals. GC patients with a lower expression of PITX1 had
   a poor prognosis. The expression of PITX1 affected the sensitivity of GC
   cells to 5-FU/CDDP, indicating that PITX1 may increase the efficacy of
   treatment in GC patients.

AB Complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHL1) was recently reported to
   be a potential biomarker in several types of cancer. CFHL1, however, has
   not been found to be of prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC) to date. In the present study, the expression levels of CFHL1 were
   evaluated in 8 pairs fresh frozen tissue samples using western blotting.
   Furthermore, the expression level of CFHL1 was evaluated in 76 pairs of
   formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC and peritumoral tissues
   (expression pattern cohort), and 278 FFPE HCC tissues (prognostic
   cohort) using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry. The
   Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression proportional hazard model and
   receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to evaluate
   prognostic factors. The expression level of CFHL1 was reduced in HCC
   tissues in 67.1% (51/76) of the cases compared with the corresponding
   peritumoral tissues. Survival analyses indicated that patients with HCC
   with low CFHL1 expression had a worse time-to-recurrence (TTR) and
   overall survival (OS) compared with those with high CFHL1 expression in
   the prognostic cohort (P=0.002 for OS and P=0.017 for TTR). Both
   univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that CHFL1 was an
   independent prognostic factor for TTR and OS (P=0.017 and P=0.002,
   respectively). In addition, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Human
   Protein Atlas were used for further validation. Furthermore, a
   prognostic model included tumor size, tumor number, liver cirrhosis and
   CFHL1 expression was evaluated. The results of the present study
   demonstrated that CFHL1 was downregulated in HCC and its level was
   associated with patient prognosis; therefore, CFHL1 is a potential
   prognostic marker for HCC.

AB Prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced 1 (PMEPA1) has been
   reported to promote cancer progression. Metastasis is the main factor
   leading to cancer progression and poor prognosis, and at the beginning
   of metastasis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial
   activation. However, the relationship between PMEPA1 and EMT in
   colorectal cancer metastasis is still poorly understood. In this study,
   we first testified that PMEPA1 expresses higher in tumour than normal
   tissue in Gene Expression Omnibus database, in the Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) as well as in the clinical data we collected. Moreover, the
   higher expression was associated with poor prognosis. We furthermore
   demonstrated PMEPA1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis and EMT in
   vivo and in vitro. We found that PMEPA1 activates the bone morphogenetic
   proteins (BMP) signalling of TGF-beta signalling resulting in promoting
   EMT and accelerating the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal
   cancer.

AB Aim: To understand potential pro-oncological effects of lower dose
   paclitaxel treatment in cervical cancer cells, we investigated the
   potential roles of KRT17 on migration and proliferation of cervical
   cancer cells which might respond to cytoskeletal-based drugs treatments.
   Materials and methods: We extracted the clinic data of cervical cancer
   patients from TCGA database to investigate mRNA expression of different
   keratins. HPV genotypes were identified by reverse transcription PCR.
   krt17 mRNA and EMT markers were quantified by real-time PCR. krt17 and
   EMT markers protein were immunoblotted by western blot. Cell viability
   was detected by CCK8. Cell migration was performed by transwell
   migration assay.
   Key findings: Our results showed that HPV16 infection correlated with
   the expression of KRT17 in cervical cancer cell lines. KRT17 knockdown
   would decrease Snail2 and elevate E-Cadherin to inhibit migration of
   Caski cells and SiHa cells. Lower dose of paclitaxel promoted SiHa
   proliferation, it also significantly promoted the migration of Caski
   cells. Otherwise, colchicine and higher dose of paclitaxel
   dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation and migration of Caski
   cells and SiHa cells. Moreover, KRT17 knockdown significantly
   facilitated cytoskeletal-based drugs to inhibit migration and induce
   cytotoxicity in cervical cancer cells.
   Significance: KRT17 played pivotal oncogenic roles in cell survival,
   migration and paclitaxel-induced resistance of cervical cancer cells.
   Thus, KRT17 would serve as a promising target for compromising
   paclitaxel-induced resistance and metastasis.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve important roles in drug-resistance; however,
   exosomal miRNAs associated with drug-resistance in ovarian cancer (OC)
   have not been reported to date. The current study aimed to analyze the
   drug resistance-associated exosomal miRNAs in original OC cells and
   their derived exosomes using microarray data downloaded from the Gene
   Expression Omnibus database (series GSE76449). The chemosensitive OC
   cell lines SKOV3_ip1, A2780_PAR and HEYA8, as well as the chemoresistant
   cell lines SKOV3_TR, A2780_CP20 and HEYA8_MDR, were investigated.
   Differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified using the
   limma method, and their mRNA targets were predicted using the miRWalk
   and LinkedOmics database. Functions of target genes were analyzed with
   DAVID tool, while TCGA data were used to explore the survival
   association of identified miRNAs. According to the results, 28 DE-miRNAs
   were found to be common in exosomal and original samples of A2780_CP20
   cells, among which the functions of 5 miRNAs were predicted (including
   miR-146b-5p, miR-509-5p, miR-574-3p, miR-574-5p and miR-760). In
   addition, 16 and 35 DE-miRNAs were detected for HEYA8_MDR and SKOV3_TR,
   respectively, with the functions of 4 of these miRNAs predicted for each
   cell line (HEYA8_MDR: miR-30a-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-612 and miR-617;
   SKOV3_TR: miR-193a-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-769-5p and miR-922). It was also
   reported that miR-183-5p was the only one common miRNA among the three
   cell lines. Furthermore, miR-574-3p, miR-30a-5p and miR-922 may regulate
   CUL2 to mediate HIF-1 cancer signaling pathway, while miR-183-5p may
   modulate MECP2, similar to miR-760, miR-30a-5p and miR-922, to influence
   cell proliferation. Finally, the downregulated miR-612 may promote the
   expression of TEAD3 via the Hippo signaling pathway, and this miRNA was
   associated with poor prognosis. In conclusion, the findings of the
   present study suggested several underlying miRNA targets for improving
   the chemotherapy sensitivity of OC.

AB Tumor targeting agents are being developed for early tumor detection and

   demonstrated its specific binding to human esophageal specimens of
   high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and adenocarcinoma with imaging ex vivo.
   Here, we aim to identify the target for this peptide and investigate its
   potential applications in imaging and drug delivery. With SNF*
   conjugated affinity chromatography, mass spectrum, Western blot,
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and molecular docking, we
   found that the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was the
   potential target of SNF*. Next, we showed that FITC-labeled SNF*
   (SNF*-FITC) colocalized with EpCAM antibody on the surface of esophageal
   adenocarcinoma cells OE33, and SNF*-FITC binding patterns significantly
   changed after EpCAM knockdown or exogenous EpCAM transfection. With the
   data from TCGA, we demonstrated that EpCAM was overexpressed in 17 types
   of cancers. Using colon and gastric adenocarcinoma cells and tissues as
   examples, we found that SNF*-FITC bound in a pattern was colocalized
   with EpCAM antibody, and the SNF* binding did not upregulate the EpCAM
   downstream Wnt signals. Subsequently, we conjugated SNF* with our
   previously constructed poly(histidine)-PEG/DSPE copolymer micelles. SNF*
   labeling significantly improved the micelle binding with colon and
   gastric adenocarcinoma cells in vitro, and enhanced the antitumor
   effects and decreased the toxicities of the micelles in vivo. In
   conclusion, we identified and validated SNF* as a specific peptide for
   EpCAM. The future potential use of SNF* peptide in multiple tumor
   surveillance and tumor-targeted therapeutics was demonstrated.

AB The two most frequent types of endometrial cancer (EC) are endometrioid
   (EEC) and serous carcinomas (SC). Differential diagnosis between them is
   not always easy. A subset of endometrial cancers shows misleading
   microscopical features, which cause problems in differential diagnosis,
   and may be a good scenario for next-generation sequencing. Previous
   studies have assessed the usefulness of targeted sequencing with panels
   of generic cancer-associated genes in EC histological typing. Based on
   the analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), EEC and SC have
   different mutational profiles. In this proof of principle study, we have
   performed targeted sequencing analysis with a customized panel, based on
   the TCGA mutational profile of EEC and SC, in a series of 24 tumors (16
   EEC and 8 SC). Our panel comprised coding and non-coding sequences of
   the following genes: ABCC9, ARID1A, ARID5B, ATR, BCOR, CCND1, CDH19,

   TP53, TSPYL2, USP36, and WRAP53. Targeted sequencing validation by
   Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemistry was performed in a group of
   genes. POLE mutation status was assessed by Sanger sequencing. The most
   mutated genes were PTEN (93.7%), ARID1A (68.7%), PIK3CA (50%), and KMT2B
   (43.7%) for EEC, and TP53 (87.5%), PIK3CA (50%), and PPP2R1A (25%) for
   SC. Our panel allowed correct classification of all tumors in the two
   categories (EEC, SC). Coexistence of mutations in PTEN, ARID1A, and
   KMT2B was diagnostic of EEC. On the other hand, absence of PTEN, ARID1A,
   and KMT2B mutations in the presence of TP53 mutation was diagnostic of
   SC. This proof of concept study demonstrates the suitability of targeted
   sequencing with a customized endometrial cancer gene panel as an
   additional tool for confirming histological typing.

AB OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to examine the role and mechanism of
   a conserved long noncoding RNA termed NORAD (non-coding RNA activated by
   DNA damage, also named UNC00657) in gastric cancer (GC) progression.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction
   (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression level of relevant genes
   in GC cell lines. Cell proliferation was examined by cell counting kit-8
   (CCK-8) assays. Cell migration and invasion were detected by transwell
   migration and invasion assays. Protein levels of the indicated genes
   were detected by Western blotting. Cell apoptosis was examined by flow
   cytometry.
   RESULTS: Results showed that NORAD knockdown decreased cell
   proliferation, migration and invasion but increased cell apoptosis.
   NORAD knockdown affected the expression of genes related to apoptosis
   and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). In addition, NORAD's
   depletion resulted in reduced Ras Homolog Family Member A (RhoA) and
   Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1)
   expression. Furthermore. NORAD's expression was positively correlated
   with RhoA and ROCK1 expressions in GC based on The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the oncogenic role of NORAD in
   gastric cancer progression.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the prognostic value of miR-421
   in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) in
   ESAD and its potential regulatory network.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: An in-silico analysis was conducted using data
   from large databases. including The Cancer Genome Atlas-Esophageal
   Carcinoma (TCGA-ESCA), Starbase 3.0 and GeneMANIA.
   RESULTS: Both esophageal adenocarcinoma (ESAD) and esophageal squamous
   cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues had significantly upregulate miR-421
   expression, compared with adjacent normal tissues. Upregulated miR-421
   expression was associated with shorter OS, but not RFS in ESAD. In
   patients with ESCC, no difference in miR-421 expression was observed
   regards to OS or RFS status. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed
   that high miR-421 expression was independently associated with shorter
   OS (HR: 2.77. 95%CI: 1.41-5.46, p<0.01), after adjustment of
   histological grade and pathological stages. The predicted regulatory
   network of miR-421 in ESAD includes both tumor suppressors and
   oncogenes, which makes the role of miR-421 quite mysterious in this
   cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS: MiR-421 expression might serve as a valuable prognostic
   biomarker in patients with ESAD. But future molecular studies are
   required to explore the exact regulatory effect of it.

AB Background: Gene fusions and products have been identified as oncogenic
   drivers in many cancers, making them attractive diagnostic markers and
   therapeutic targets. However, the landscape of fusion transcripts in
   bladder cancer has not been fully characterized.
   Methods: To identify fusion transcripts with potential therapeutic or
   diagnostic values, TCGA bladder urothelial carcinoma RNA-sequencing
   dataset was used. In order to avoid false positives, we applied multiple
   criteria including filtering out fusions detected in normal samples from
   GTEx dataset. We validated a subset of candidate fusions with a
   collection of bladder cancer and adjacent normal samples.
   Result We identified 19,547 high confidence fusion genes from 414
   bladder cancer samples. After filtering off M/M fusions, fusions in GTEx
   normal samples, and occurrence frequency < 5, we obtained a list of 271
   gene fusions, 13 of which were novel and specific to cancer samples. Six
   of those fusions were validated using cell lines and clinical samples.
   We discovered that two chimeric RNAs, BCL2L2-PABPN1 and CHFR-GOLGA3,
   were detected to be expressed significantly higher in bladder cancer
   samples compared to adjacent normal samples. Impressively, the wild-type
   of the parental genes were not differentially expressed.
   Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these two fusions are generated by
   cis-splicing between adjacent genes. These two fusions were detected
   mainly in the fraction of cell nucleus, suggesting a potential long
   noncoding RNA role.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide a panoramic view of the landscape of
   chimeric RNAs in bladder cancer. Some frequent chimeric RNAs are
   generated by intergenic splicing, and represent a new repertoire for
   potential biomarkers.

TI Peripheral location and infiltrative margin predict invasive features of

DI 10.1530/EJE-18-1025
PD 2019-May-01
PY 2019
AB OBJECTIVE: Tumor location in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC)
   might determine tumor outgrowth from the thyroid gland. However, the
   clinical implications of tumor location and minimal extrathyroid
   extension (mETE) have not been well-elucidated. We aimed to investigate
   the relationship between tumor location and mETE to predict
   aggressiveness of PTMC.
   METHODS: A total of 858 patients with PTMC were grouped according to
   tumor location on ultrasonography: central (cPTMC) and peripheral PTMC
   (pPTMC). PTMC without mETE (PTMC-mETE(-)) was divided further according
   to margin shape: encapsulated (E-) or infiltrative (I-). To understand
   the molecular biologic characteristics of PTMC presenting with an
   I-margin and mETE, transcriptome data from TCGA-THCA were analyzed using
   Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
   RESULTS: pPTMC (n=807, 94.1%) accounted for the majority of cases; mETE
   was identified only in pPTMC (403/807; 49.9%). pPTMC-mETE(+) showed
   aggressive clinical characteristics that increased the odds ratio (OR)
   for lymph node metastasis (LNM). Interestingly, subgroup analysis of
   PTMC-mETE(-) revealed that the I-margin also increased the OR for LNM,
   independent of other clinical factors. GSEA of TCGA-THCA data suggested
   coordinated upregulation of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT) in PTC with mETE. Immunohistochemical staining for
   Laminin Subunit Gamma 2 (LAMC2), CD59, E-cadherin, and vimentin showed
   that these markers of EMT were associated with progressive changes in
   E-margin PTMC-mETE(-), I-margin PTMC-mETE(-), and pPTMC-mETE(+).
   CONCLUSION: mETE related to peripheral location of PTMC is an important
   predictor of tumor invasiveness, as is the I-margin, which presents with
   EMT features similar to mETE. I-margin PTMC-mETE(-) and pPTMC-mETE(+)
   might reflect the pattern of invasive PTMC.

AB Breast cancer risk is 31% heritable, yet the majority of the underlying
   risk factors remain poorly defined. Here, we used F2-linkage analysis in
   a rat mammary tumor model to identify a novel 11.2 Mb modifier locus of
   tumor incidence and burden on rat chromosome 5 (chr5: 15.4 - 26.6 Mb).
   Genomic and RNA sequencing analysis identified four differentially
   expressed candidates: TMEM68, IMPAD1, SDCBP, and RBM12B. Analysis of the
   human syntenic candidate region revealed that SDCBP is in close
   proximity to a previously reported genetic risk locus for human breast
   cancer. Moreover, analysis of the candidate genes in The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) revealed that they fall within the commonly amplified
   8q12.1 and 8q22.1 regions in human breast cancer patients and are
   correlated with worse overall survival. Collectively, this study
   presents novel evidence suggesting that TMEM68, IMPAD1, SDCBP, and
   RBM12B are potential modifiers of human breast cancer risk and outcome.

AB In addition to its implication in hereditary hearing loss, the Gasdermin
   E (GSDME) gene is also a tumor suppressor involved in cancer progression
   through programmed cell death. GSDME epigenetic silencing through
   methylation has been shown in some cancer types, but studies are yet to
   fully explore its diagnostic/prognostic potential in colorectal cancer
   on a large-scale. We used public data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) to investigate differences in GSDME methylation and expression
   between colorectal cancer and normal colorectal tissue, and between
   left- and right-sided colorectal cancers in 432 samples. We also
   explored GSDME's diagnostic capacity as a biomarker for colorectal
   cancer. We observed differential methylation in all 22 GSDME CpGs
   between tumor and normal tissues, and in 18 CpGs between the left- and
   right-sided groups. In the cancer tissue, putative promoter probes were
   hypermethylated and gene body probes were hypomethylated, while this
   pattern was inversed in normal tissues. Both putative promoter and gene
   body CpGs correlated well together but formed distinct methylation
   patterns with the putative promoter exhibiting the most pronounced
   methylation differences between tumor and normal tissues.
   Clinicopathological parameters, excluding age, did not show any effect
   on CpG methylation. Although the methylation of 5 distinct probes was a
   good predictor of gene expression, we could not identify an association
   between GSDME methylation and expression in general. Survival analysis
   showed no association between GSDME methylation and expression on 5-year
   patient survival. Through logistic regression, we identified a
   combination of 2 CpGs, that can discriminate between cancer and normal
   tissue with high accuracy (AUC=0.95) irrespective of age and tumor
   stage. We also validated our model in 3 external methylation datasets,
   from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and similar results were
   reached. Our results suggest that GSDME is a promising biomarker for the
   detection of colorectal cancer.

AB Background Germline variants in DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) may
   influence DNMT3B enzymatic activity, which, in turn, may affect cancer
   aggressiveness by altering DNA methylation.
   Methods The study involves two Italian cohorts (NTAT cohort, n = 157,
   and 1980s biopsy cohort, n = 182) and two U.S. cohorts (Health
   Professionals Follow-Up Study, n = 214, and Physicians' Health Study, n
   = 298) of prostate cancer (PCa) patients, and a case-control study of
   lethal (n = 113) vs indolent (n = 290) PCa with DNMT3B mRNA expression
   data nested in the U.S. cohorts. We evaluated the association between:
   three selected DNMT3B variants and global DNA methylation using linear
   regression in the NTAT cohort, the three DNMT3B variants and PCa
   mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression in all cohorts, and
   DNMT3B expression and lethal PCa using logistic regression, with
   replication in publicly available databases (TCGA, n = 492 and MSKCC, n
   = 140).
   Results The TT genotype of rs1569686 was associated with LINE-1
   hypomethylation in tumor tissue (beta = -2.71, 95% CI: -5.41, -0.05).
   There was no evidence of association between DNMT3B variants and PCa
   mortality. DNMT3B expression was consistently associated with lethal PCa
   in the two U.S. cohorts (3rd vs 1st tertile, combined cohorts: OR =
   2.04, 95% CI: 1.13, 3.76); the association was replicated in TCGA and
   MSKCC data (3rd vs 1st tertile, TCGA: HR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.78, 5.06;
   MSKCC: HR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 4.86).
   Conclusions Although there was no consistent evidence of an association
   between DNMT3B variants and PCa mortality, the TT genotype of rs1569686
   was associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation in tumor tissue and DNMT3B
   mRNA expression was associated with an increased risk of lethal PCa.

AB Background Prostate cancer (PCa) tumors harboring translocations of ETS
   family genes with the androgen responsive TMPRSS2 gene (ETS+ tumors)
   provide a robust biomarker for detecting PCa in approximately 70% of
   patients. ETS+ PCa express high levels of the androgen receptor (AR),
   yet PCa tumors lacking ETS fusions (ETS-) also express AR and
   demonstrate androgen-regulated growth. In this study, we evaluate the
   differences in the AR-regulated transcriptomes between ETS+ and ETS- PCa
   tumors.
   Methods 10,608 patient tumors from three independent PCa datasets
   classified as ETS+ (samples overexpressing ERG or other ETS family
   members) or ETS- (all other PCa) were analyzed for differential gene
   expression using false-discovery-rate adjusted methods and gene-set
   enrichment analysis (GSEA).
   Results Based on the expression of AR-dependent genes and an
   unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model, AR-regulated gene
   expression alone was able to separate PCa samples into groups based on
   ETS status in all PCa databases. ETS status distinguished several
   differentially expressed genes in both TCGA (6.9%) and GRID (6.6%)
   databases, with 413 genes overlapping in both databases. Importantly,
   GSEA showed enrichment of distinct androgen-responsive genes in both
   ETS- and ETS+ tumors, and AR ChIP-seq data identified 131 direct
   AR-target genes that are regulated in an ETS-specific fashion. Notably,
   dysregulation of ETS-dependent AR-target genes within the metabolic and
   non-canonical WNT pathways was associated with clinical outcomes.
   Conclusions ETS status influences the transcriptional repertoire of the
   AR, and ETS- PCa tumors appear to rely on distinctly different
   AR-dependent transcriptional programs to drive and sustain
   tumorigenesis.

AB BACKGROUND: Metabolic rewiring allows cancer cells to sustain high
   proliferation rates. Thus, targeting only the cancer-specific cellular
   metabolism will safeguard healthy tissues.
   METHODS: We developed the very efficient FASTCORMICS RNA-seq workflow
   (rFASTCORMICS) to build 10,005 high-resolution metabolic models from the
   TCGA dataset to capture metabolic rewiring strategies in cancer cells.
   Colorectal cancer (CRC) was used as a test case for a repurposing
   workflow based on rFASTCORMICS.
   FINDINGS: Alternative pathways that are not required for proliferation
   or survival tend to be shut down and, therefore, tumours display
   cancer-specific essential genes that are significantly enriched for
   known drug targets. We identified naftifine, ketoconazole, and mimosine
   as new potential CRC drugs, which were experimentally validated.
   INTERPRETATION: The here presented rFASTCORMICS workflow successfully
   reconstructs a metabolic model based on RNA-seq data and successfully
   predicted drug targets and drugs not yet indicted for colorectal cancer.
   FUND: This study was supported by the University of Luxembourg (IRP
   grant scheme; R-AGR-0755-12), the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR

AB BACKGROUND: Melanoma-associated antigen-A (MAGE-A) was recognized as
   high-expressed in many solid tumors including esophageal carcinoma (EC),
   nevertheless, was reported to be low/not-expressed in normal tissues.
   Thus, it was considered as an extraordinary appropriate target for
   treatment especially in immunotherapy. Therefore, it demanded more
   detail knowledge on the precise function of MAGE-A.
   METHODS: In this study, we used the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas
   dataset (TCGA-ESCA) to analyze the expression and survival for MAGE
   A3/4/11 (the subtype of MAGE-A) using the online tool of UALCAN.
   Furthermore, the high-throughput sequencing data of the patients with
   esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) from TCGA dataset were
   performed to analyze the correlation test, gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of MAGE
   A3/4/9/11 using LinkeDomics (online tool) and ClueGO (inner software of
   Cytoscape). Finally, relative gene expressions of MAGE A3/4/9/11 were
   verified by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) in the patients with EC.
   RESULTS: MAGE A3/4/11 was high-expressed in tissues of patients with
   ESCC, and there was no difference in survival time for patients between
   the high-expressed with the low/medium-expressed. The Go enrichment
   analysis showed that the 4 MAGE-A subtypes (MAGE-A3/4/9/11) were
   enriched in the regulation of the adaptive immune response,
   translational initiation, interleukin-4 production, response to type I
   interferon, and skin development, respectively. The KEGG results showed
   that they were enriched in T cell receptor signaling pathway (MAGE-A3),
   Th1 and Th2 differentiation, antigen processing and presentation
   (MAGE-A4), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (MAGE-A9), and
   chemokine signaling pathway (MAGE-A11).
   CONCLUSION: MAGE A3/4/9/11 was high-expressed in EC, and were enrolled
   in the regulation of immune response. They may consider as candidate
   immune target for EC treatment and provided the messages for further
   research in the function of MAGE-A.

AB HER2 upregulation is related with poor outcome in many tumor types.
   Whereas anti-HER2 treatment is the standard approach as adjuvant therapy
   in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, the frequent relapses reinforce
   the need for alternative treatments. Here we used next-generation
   sequencing (NGS)to evaluate miRNAs and circRNAs in the cell-lines HB4a
   and C5.2, where the latter is a HER2-overexpressing clone of the former,
   and also from two different populations of their secreted extracellular
   vesicles. Whereas circRNA-levels were stable, we found at least 16
   miRNAs apparently modulated by HER2-expression. The miR223-3p, miR-421
   and miR-21-5p were validated in an independent cohort of 431 breast
   cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The consistent
   modulation of these molecules and their possible involvement in the
   HER2-axis makes them promising new targets to overcome HER2-activation.

   the signature was 0.979, 0.844, 0.99 and 0.997 by logistic regression,
   support vector machine, decision tree and random forest models,
   respectively, and the AUCs in predicting 1- to 10-year survival were
   between 0.656 and 0.748 in the test dataset from TCGA database.
   Conclusions The eight-lncRNA signature could serve as an independent
   biomarker for prediction of overall survival of BRCA. The
   lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network is a good tool to identify lncRNAs that
   is correlated with overall survival of BRCA.

AB Purpose Genomic studies have revealed that genomic aberrations play
   important roles in the progression of this disease. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the associations between clinical survival
   outcomes of the clonality and subclonality status of driver genes in
   breast cancer.
   Methods We performed an integrated analysis to infer the clonal status
   of 55 driver genes in breast cancer data from TCGA. We used the
   chi-squared test to assess the relations between clonality of driver
   gene mutations and clinicopathological factors. The Kaplan-Meier method
   was performed for the visualization and the differences between survival
   curves were calculated by log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox
   proportional hazards regression models were used to adjust for
   clinicopathological factors.
   Results We identified a high proportion of clonal mutations in these
   driver genes. Among them, there were 17 genes showing significant
   associations between their clonality and multiple clinicopathologic
   factors. Performing survival analysis on BRCA patients with clonal or
   subclonal driver gene mutations, we found that clonal ERBB2, FOXA1, and
   KMT2C mutations and subclonal GATA3 and RB1 mutations predicted shorter
   overall survival compared with those with wild type. Furthermore, clonal
   ERBB2 and FOXA1 mutations and subclonal GATA3 and RB1 mutations
   independently predicted for shorter overall survival after adjusting for
   clinicopathological factors. By longitudinal analysis, the clonality of
   ERBB2, FOXA1, GATA3, and RB1 significantly predicted patients' outcome
   within some specific BRCA tumor stages and histological subtypes.
   Conclusions In summary, these clonal or subclonal mutations of driver
   genes have implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment with
   BRCA patients.

AB Purpose African-American (AA) patients with triple-negative breast
   cancer (TNBC) are less likely to achieve pathologic complete response
   from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have poorer prognosis than Caucasian
   patients with TNBC, suggesting potential biological differences by race.
   Immune infiltration is the most consistent predictive marker for
   chemotherapy response and improved prognosis in TNBC. In this study, we
   test the hypothesis that the immune microenvironment differs between AA
   and Caucasian patients.
   Methods RNA-seq expression data were obtained from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) database for 162 AA and 697 Caucasian breast cancers.
   Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor
   receptor-2 (HER2)-positive, and TNBC subtypes were included in the
   analyses. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts, immunomodulatory
   scores, and molecular subtypes were obtained from prior publications for
   a subset of the TNBC cases. Differences in immune cell distributions and
   immune functions, measured through gene expression and TIL counts, as
   well as neoantigen, somatic mutation, amplification, and deletion loads,
   were compared by race and tumor subtype.
   Results Immune metagene analysis demonstrated marginal immune
   attenuation in AA TNBC relative to Caucasian TNBC that did not reach
   statistical significance. The distributions of immune cell populations,
   lymphocyte infiltration, molecular subtypes, and genomic aberrations
   between AA and Caucasian subtypes were also not significantly different.
   The MHC1 metagene demonstrated increased expression in AA ER-positive
   cancers relative to Caucasian ER-positive cancers.
   Conclusions This study suggests that the immunological differences
   between AA and Caucasian breast cancers represented by TCGA data are
   subtle, if they exist at all. We observed no consistent racial
   differences in immune gene expression or TIL counts in TNBC by race.
   However, this study cannot rule out small differences in immune cell
   subtype distribution and activity status that may not be apparent in
   bulk RNA analysis.

AB Background: Infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most
   common histologicaI subtype of breast cancer, accounting for 10% of all
   cases. ILC has a characteristic genomic profile. ILC shows a high
   frequency of cadherin 1 (CDH1) mutations, along with loss of phosphatase
   and tensin homolog (PTEN), activation of alpha serine/threonine kinase
   (AKT), and mutations in T-box transcription factor (TBX3) and forkhead
   box protein A1 (FOXA1). We suspected that another gene, von Willebrand
   factor (VWF), might also be part of the profile, since coagulation tests
   reveal significant differences in patients with breast cancer. Materials
   and Methods: For newly-diagnosed breast cancer, the association between
   VWF and histology in the GDC Breast Cancer dataset in The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) was evaluated. The following were used to access and
   analyze the data: Genomic Data Commons Data Portal
   (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/); Xena browser
   (https://xenabrowser.net); cBioportal (http://cbioportal.org); Oncomine
   (https://oncomine.org); and Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50
   (PAM50). Results: Patients with ILC had higher VWF RNA expression than
   patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma and other histology. The
   difference of expression was present to the same degree in both
   pre-menopausal and postmenopausal patients. Nine alterations in VWF and
   PTEN were significantly co-occurrent. Considering all histologies in 843
   samples, Tukey's honest significant difference post hoc test showed that
   VWF RNA expression of the normal subtype was significantly greater than
   that of the other subtypes (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our finding of
   significantly higher VWF RNA expression in the PAM50 normal
   (non-basal-like) breast cancer subtype suggests that VWF protein
   measurement might complement or corroborate PAM50 results. VWF and PAM50
   results both suggesting a low risk of recurrence might make the decision
   whether to give chemotherapy easier, especially if VWF protein were an
   independent predictor.

AB Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy,
   wherein diagnostic limitations and lack of accurate prognostic factors
   are important clinical challenges. In this study, we report the
   discovery of 234 novel miRNAs in non-neoplastic thyroid and PTC samples,
   obtained from publicly available small RNA sequencing datasets (TCGA and
   GEO). These sequences were observed to display similar molecular
   features compared to currently annotated miRNAs. These potentially novel
   miRNAs presented tissue-specificity and largely decreased expression in
   PTC compared to nonneoplastic samples. We showed that the disrupted
   novel miRNAs have diagnostic and prognostic potential, and were
   associated with BRAF mutation, a frequent alteration related to more
   aggressive PTC. In conclusion, our results expand the miRNA repertoire
   in thyroid tissues and highlight the potential biological role and
   clinical utility of previously unannotated miRNAs.

AB Reports regarding the frequency of SMAD4 loss in human head and neck
   squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) vary significantly. We have shown that
   SMAD4 deletion contributes to HNSCC initiation and progression.
   Therefore, accurately detecting genetic SMAD4 loss is critical to
   determine prognosis and therapeutic interventions in personalized
   medicine. We developed a SMAD4 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
   assay to identify chromosomal SMAD4 loss at the single cell level of
   primary HNSCC specimens and patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors
   derived from HNSCCs. SMAD4 heterozygous loss was detected in 35% of
   primary HNSCCs and 41.3% of PDX tumors. Additionally, 4.3% of PDX tumors
   had SMAD4 homozygous loss. These frequencies of SMAD4 loss were similar
   to those in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, we identified
   significant heterogeneities of SMAD4 loss (partial or complete) among
   cells within each tumor. We also found that aneuploidy (monosomy and
   polysomy) contributed greatly to how to define chromosomal SMAD4
   deletion. Furthermore, in cultured PDX tumors, SMAD4 mutant cells
   outcompeted SMAD4 wildtype cells, resulting in establishing homogenous
   SMAD4 mutant HNSCC cell lines with partial or complete genomic SMAD4
   loss, suggesting a survival advantage of SMAD4 mutant cells. Taken
   together, our study reveals inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneities of
   SMAD4 chromosomal loss in HNSCCs. Further, SMAD4 FISH assay provides a
   platform for future clinical diagnosis of SMAD4 chromosomal loss that
   potentially serves as a molecular marker for prognosis and therapeutic
   intervention in cancer patients.

AB Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant cancer with an unknown etiology
   and an unfavorable prognosis. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced
   stage, thus making it essential to find novel curative targets for CCA.
   Metabolic reprogramming of the tumor cells includes metabolic
   abnormalities in glucose (known as the Warburg effect) and other
   substances such as amino acids and fats. Metabolic reprogramming
   produces anti-oxidant substances, reduces tumor oxidative stress, and
   finally promotes the proliferation of tumors. There is increasing
   evidence to imply that SIRT2, a histone deacetylase, and its downstream
   target cMYC, play metabolic regulatory roles in tumor cells. However,
   the role of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA is unclear. To assess the
   metabolic reprogramming function of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA and to
   determine the downstream targets as well as evaluate the therapeutic
   effect, the CCA RNA-Seq data were downloaded from the TCGA database.
   Differentially expressed genes were confirmed and KEGG pathway
   enrichment analysis was performed. Overall, 48 paired CCA samples were
   collected and subjected to immunohistochemical detection, and the
   clinical characteristics of participants were summarized. The CCA cells
   were suppressed or overexpressed with different downstream targets of
   SIRT2 and then subjected to apoptosis, immunoblotting, seahorse, and
   metabolites tracing analysis. In vivo experiments were also performed.
   We found that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway contributed to the proliferation of
   CCA cells and confirmed that the downstream target is PHDA1 and the
   serine synthesis pathway. The up-regulated SIRT2 and cMYC levels
   resulted in low levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and
   increased conversion of glucose to serine and led to poor patient
   survival. The highly active SIRT2/cMYC pathway upregulated the serine
   synthesis pathway pyruvate and increased antioxidant production, thus
   consequently protecting the CCA cells from oxidative stress-induced
   apoptosis. Our data revealed that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway plays a
   critical role in transforming glucose oxidative metabolism to serine
   anabolic metabolism, thus providing antioxidants for stress resistance.
   SIRT2/cMYC-induced metabolic reprogramming may represent a new
   therapeutic target for treating CCA.

   subtype of lung cancer. Kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A) plays an
   important role in tumorigenesis. Its roles in breast cancer, colorectal
   cancer, and other tumors have been demonstrated; however, studies of
   KIF18A in LUAD are limited. This study aimed to determine the role of
   KIF18A in LUAD progression and prognostic prediction. Methods KIF18A
   expression was examined in LUAD cells and tissues by
   immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Cell proliferation assay was
   performed to study the role of KIF18A in LUAD cells. Correlations
   between KIF18A expression and clinicopathological features were
   analyzed. The role of KIF18A in LUAD prognosis was evaluated using data
   from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results KIF18A expression was
   increased in tumor cells and tissues. Downregulation of KIF18A
   expression resulted in the suppression of cancer cell proliferation in
   in vitro assays, and was particularly related to poor tumor
   differentiation, big tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and more
   advanced tumor stage. In the TCGA dataset, high KIF18A messenger RNA
   expression was associated with poor disease-free and overall survival in
   patients with LUAD. In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that
   KIF18A is an independent prognostic factor of disease-free and overall
   survival in LUAD. Conclusions Collectively, our results demonstrate that
   KIFl8A is highly expressed in LUAD. KIFl8A plays an important role in
   LUAD cell proliferation, but is a poor prognostic factor.

   CHRNA7) in 141 patients was measured by IHC and a high expression of
   alpha7 nAChR was associated with unfavorable prognosis (P = .008).
   Multivariate analysis showed that alpha7 nAChR was an independent
   prognostic factor (HR = 2.041; 95% CI 1.188-3.506; P = .007).alpha7
   nAChR was upregulated in NSCLC and was associated with unfavorable

AB BACKGROUND/AIM: Death receptor 6 (DR6) is a member of the tumor necrosis
   factor receptor superfamily. The expression of DR6 is elevated in
   different kinds of tumors including ovarian, breast cancer and adult
   sarcoma. In these tumors, the receptor may be handled as a new
   diagnostic and prognostic marker. Thus, we investigated the expression
   of DR6 in gliomas.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor and control tissues were extracted during
   neurosurgery and grouped according to the WHO classification. DR6
   expression was investigated in low- and high-grade gliomas PCR (n=70),
   immunofluorescence staining (n=33) and western blot (n=58). Additional
   analysis of TCGA-data was performed to assess the general alteration of
   DR6 in cancer and influence of IDH-mutation on DR6 expression in
   gliomas.
   RESULTS: The expression of DR6 was significantly enhanced in gliomas
   (p<0.05). It showed a trend towards rising expression with increasing
   malignancy of the tumor. Chemotherapy treatment could have an influence
   on DR6 expression.
   CONCLUSION: In our investigation, DR6 acts as a potential suitable
   diagnostic marker for gliomas.

AB Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common gynecological malignancies
   and owns the highest mortality rate among all gynecological malignant
   tumors. ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 9 (ABCB9) is an antigen
   processing-like (TAPL) transporter that has been found to be involved in
   the development and progression of various malignant tumors in
   accumulating reports. However, the potential role of ABCB9 in OC has
   never been reported.In this study, ABCB9 expression was evaluated in
   normal ovarian tissues and ovarian cancer tissues using The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. And the associations between ABCB9
   expression and clinical parameters of patients of OC were evaluated by
   Chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were
   performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of ABCB9. GSEA was
   performed to explore related signaling pathway.ABCB9 expression levels
   were significantly decreased in OC compared with normal ovarian tissues
   (P < .001). Low ABCB9 expression was associated with survival status
   (P = .0148) in OC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low ABCB9
   expression was associated with poor overall survival in OC (P = .0032).
   Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that low ABCB9
   expression was an independent prognostic factor (HR 0.64; P = .01) in OC
   patients. Besides, epithelial mesenchymal transition, UV response, and
   TGF-beta signaling were enriched in low ABCB9 expression phenotype,
   respectively, examined by gene set enrichment analysis.These results
   suggest that ABCB9 is an independent prognostic indicator in OC with
   certain clinical significance.

TI SPINT2 is hypermethylated in both IDH1 mutated and wild-type

AB PurposeBoth IDH1-mutated and wild-type gliomas abundantly display
   aberrant CpG island hypermethylation. However, the potential role of
   hypermethylation in promoting gliomas, especially the most aggressive
   form, glioblastoma (GBM), remains poorly understood.MethodsWe analyzed
   RRBS-generated methylation profiles for 11 IDH1(WT) gliomas (including 7
   GBMs), 24 IDH1(MUT) gliomas (including 6 GBMs), and 5 normal brain
   samples and employed TCGA GBM methylation profiles as a validation set.
   Upon classification of differentially methylated CpG islands by IDH1
   status, we used integrated analysis of methylation and gene expression
   to identify SPINT2 as a top cancer related gene. To explore functional
   consequences of SPINT2 methylation in GBM, we validated SPINT2
   methylation status using targeted bisulfite sequencing in a large cohort
   of GBM samples. We assessed DNA methylation-mediated SPINT2 gene
   regulation using 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment, DNMT1 knockdown and
   luciferase reporter assays. We conducted functional analyses of SPINT2
   in GBM cell lines in vitro and in vivo.ResultsWe identified SPINT2 as a
   candidate tumor-suppressor gene within a group of CpG islands
   (designated G(T)-CMG) that are hypermethylated in both IDH1(MUT) and
   IDH1(WT) gliomas but not in normal brain. We established that SPINT2
   downregulation results from promoter hypermethylation, and that
   restoration of SPINT2 expression reduces c-Met activation and
   tumorigenic properties of GBM cells.ConclusionsWe defined a previously
   under-recognized group of coordinately methylated CpG islands common to
   both IDH1(WT) and IDH1(MUT) gliomas (G(T)-CMG). Within G(T)-CMG, we
   identified SPINT2 as a top cancer-related candidate and demonstrated
   that SPINT2 suppressed GBM via down-regulation of c-Met activation.

AB Objectives
   CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations have shown independent prognostic value in
   endometrial cancer. We aimed to assess whether nuclear -catenin
   expression is an accurate surrogate, as immunohistochemistry is cheaper,
   faster, and more widely applicable than sequencing.
   Methods A systematic review was performed by searching electronic
   databases for all studies assessing the association between -catenin
   immunohistochemical expression and CTNNB1 mutations. Meta-analysis of
   diagnostic accuracy was performed by calculating sensitivity,
   specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-),
   diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) on summary
   receiver operating characteristic curves.
   Results Fifteen observational studies with 1,158 endometrial carcinomas
   were included. Pooled estimates showed sensitivity = 0.88, specificity =
   0.85, LR+ = 4.57, LR- = 0.20, DOR = 27.16, and high diagnostic accuracy
   (AUC = 0.91).
   Conclusions Nuclear expression of -catenin is an accurate
   immunohistochemical surrogate of CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations and thus might
   be considered in the risk stratification of endometrial cancer.

AB Background: Glutamine addiction is a hallmark of clear cell renal cell
   carcinoma (ccRCC); yet whether glutamine metabolism impacts local immune
   surveillance is unclear. This knowledge may yield novel
   immunotherapeutic opportunities.
   Objective: To seek a potential therapeutic target in glutamine-addicted
   ccRCC.
   Design, setting, and participants: Tumors from ccRCC patients from a
   Shanghai cohort and ccRCC tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   cohort were analyzed. In vivo and in vitro studies were conducted with
   fresh human ccRCC tumors and murine tumor cells.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Immune cell numbers and
   functions were analyzed by flow cytometry. Glutamine and cytokine
   concentrations were determined. Survival was compared between different
   subpopulations of patients using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression
   analyses.
   Results and limitations: We found that in ccRCC, high interleukin
   (IL)-23 expression was significantly associated with poor survival in
   both TCGA (overall survival [OS] hazard ratio [HR] = 2.04,
   cancer-specific survival [CSS] HR = 2.95; all p < 0.001) and Shanghai
   (OS HR = 2.07, CSS HR = 3.92; all p < 0.001) cohorts. IL-23 blockade
   prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice, promotes T-cell
   cytotoxicity in in vitro cultures of human ccRCC tumors, and augments
   the therapeutic benefits of anti-PD-1 antibodies. Mechanistically,
   glutamine consumption by ccRCC tumor cells results in the local
   deprivation of extracellular glutamine, which induces IL-23 secretion by
   tumor-infiltrating macrophages via the activation of hypoxia-inducible
   factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha). IL-23 activates regulatory T-cell
   proliferation and promotes IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta
   expression, thereby suppressing tumor cell killing by cytotoxic
   lymphocytes. The positive correlations between glutamine metabolism,
   IL-23 levels, and Treg responses are confirmed in both TCGA cohort and
   tumors from Shanghai ccRCC patients. Study limitations include the
   unclear impacts of glutamine deprivation and IL-23 on other immune
   cells.
   Conclusions: Macrophage-secreted IL-23 enhanced Treg functions in
   glutamine-addicted tumors; thus, IL-23 is a promising target for
   immunotherapy in ccRCC.
   Patient summary: In this study, we analyzed the immune components in
   glutamine-addicted clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors from
   two patient cohorts and conducted both in vitro and in vivo studies. We
   found that ccRCC tumor cell-intrinsic glutamine metabolism orchestrates
   immune evasion via interleukin (IL)-23, and IL-23high patients had
   significantly poorer survival than IL-23-low patients. IL-23 should thus
   be considered a therapeutic target in ccRCC, either alone or in
   combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. (C) 2018 European

AB The specific diagnosis of hard-growing bacteria is one of the most
   important concerns of medical bacteriology. Legionella pneumophila is
   one of the most important bacteria in hard growth. In spite remarkable
   trends in bacteriology, now day, culture is the gold standard for
   detection of L. pneumophila. This work is an attempt to quantification
   of L pneumophila bacteria using a bioassay. The fabrication of a new
   electrochemical DNA-based bioassay using gold nano architecture combined
   with as a transducer substrate combined with toluidine blue (TB) as a
   redox marker was performed successful. Also, the mixture of
   beta-cyclodextrin and dopamine as Poly (dopamine-(3-Cyclodextrin) was
   used to proper a biointerface for stabilization of gold nanoparticles
   optimum immobilize of pDNA sequence (5-SH-TCGA TAC TCT CCC CGC CCC TT T
   TGTATCGACG-3). So, a specific thiolated pDNA was immobilized on the
   transducer substrat e and DNA hybridization was followed by C-DNA
   sequence (5-ACA AAA GGG GCG GGG AGA GTA-3) using square wave voltammetry
   and differential pulse voltammetry. At the optimum conditions, linear
   range was 1 mu M to 1 ZM and low limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1
   Zepto-molar. L pneumophila were sensitively distinguished by the planned
   DNA sensor. Finally, the engineered DNA based bioassay could be used for
   identifying the L pneumophila samples from patients or environments. (C)

AB Purpose: Trimodality therapy with maximal transurethral resection of
   bladder tumor and definitive chemoradiation reserving cystectomy for
   salvage of local recurrence is an accepted treatment alternative to
   upfront cystectomy for selected patients with muscle-invasive bladder
   cancer. There is a need for molecular biomarkers to predict which
   patients will respond to bladder preservation therapy.
   Methods and Materials: We sought to identify biomarkers with the ability
   to predict response to chemoradiation and survival after selective
   bladder preservation therapy in a cohort of 40 patients using a microRNA
   profiling approach. In vitro experiments were performed using
   transitional cell carcinoma lines CRL1749, HTB5, and HTB4.
   Results: We identified a panel of microRNAs associated with overall
   survival in our bladder preservation cohort and in the TCGA cohort. We
   also identified several microRNAs, including miR-23a and miR-27a,
   microRNAs of the miR-23a cluster, to be suggestively associated with
   complete response to chemoradiation therapy. The microRNAs were
   significantly associated with overall survival in The Cancer Genome
   Atlas cohort. In vitro studies suggest that the functional roles of
   miR-23a and miR-27a involve targeting the SFRP1 protein, a negative
   regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. The upregulation of beta-catenin
   in the Wnt signaling pathway mediated proliferation, migration,
   invasion, and sensitivity to radiation and cisplatin treatment in
   bladder cancer cells.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that miR-23a and miR-27a act as
   oncomirs, and once independently validated, they may help appropriately
   triage selected bladder cancer patients to individualize treatment. (C)

AB Dendritic cells (DCs), as professional antigen-presenting cells are
   essential for the initial activation of adaptive antitumor immunity.
   CD1d is considered to present phospholipid and glycosphingolipid
   antigens to NKT cells. However, it is currently unknown whether CD1d
   expression on DCs is capable of enhancing antitumor immunity,
   particularly T-cell related immunity. We observed that CD1d was
   predominantly expressed on DCs in 3LL tumor-bearing mice, whilst a
   deficiency of CD1d promoted tumor growth. Notably, CD1d expression on
   DCs was not only required for presenting antigen to NKT cells, but also
   markedly promoted CD4(+)T and CD8(+)T cell activation, particularly
   cytotoxic T cells. All the T cells (NKT, CD4(+)T and CD8(+)T cells)
   upregulated CD69, CD107a and IFN-gamma after the adoptive transfer of
   CD1d-positive DCs (CD1d(+)DCs) and tumor growth was suppressed. With
   regard to the mechanism, we revealed that CD1d(+)DCs were concomitant
   with a higher expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80 and
   CD86) and MHCI/II, which are essential for DCs to present antigens to T
   cells. Consistently, CD1d(+)DCs displayed stronger
   activation-associated-ERK1/2 and NF-kappa B signals; whereas
   JAK2-STAT3/6 signaling was required for maintaining a high level of CD1d
   on DCs. In lung cancer patients, the antitumor activities of all the T
   cells were enhanced with the increase of CD1d(+)DCs. Analysis of TCGA
   data revealed that high levels of CD1d indicated better outcomes for
   patients. Collectively, CD1d enhanced DC-based antitumor immunity, not
   only by targeting NKT, but also by activating CD4(+)T and CD8(+)T cells.
   CD1d(+)DCs may be superior to the bulk population of DCs in cancer
   immunotherapy.

AB There is growing evidence supporting dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) as
   potential prognostic biomarkers in cancer. The present study aimed to
   identify an miRNA model set with prognostic power for patients with
   gastric adenocarcinoma. miRNA-seq data from 155 patients and 37 controls
   were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for a
   comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles and were used as
   training data. A total of 5 prognostic miRNAs, which have not been
   previously reported, were identified using univariate and multivariate
   Cox regression analyses. A separate 155-patient TCGA cohort was used as
   a validation set for evaluation of the risk model. Patients in the
   training set were assigned into high- and low-risk groups according to
   the 5-miRNA signature risk scores. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses
   demonstrated that patients with high risk scores had significantly
   shorter survival times than those with low risk scores. The risk model
   validation confirmed the prognostic ability of this 5-miRNA signature in
   predicting the risk status of patients. Stratification analysis for
   clinical prognostic variables demonstrated recurrence and age were
   significant prognostic factors in the low- and high-risk groups,
   respectively. In conclusion, the present 5-miRNA signature is a
   potential independent risk factor for patient outcomes. The risk model
   based on the 5-miRNA signature performed well in predicting overall
   survival time in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.

   total of 230 DEGs were identified between the bone marrow tissues of
   IDH2 R140Q-mutated and wild-type AML patients, of which 31 were
   significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Functional
   assessment of DEGs showed significant enrichment in multiple biological
   processes, including angiogenesis and cell differentiation. STRING and
   GeneMANIA were used to identify the hub genes of these DEGs. CMap
   analysis identified 13 potential small-molecule drugs against IDH2
   R140Q-mutated adult de novo AML. Genome-wide co-expression network
   analysis identified several IDH2 R140Q co-expressed genes, of which 56
   were significantly associated with AML OS. The difference in IDH2 mRNA
   expression levels and OS between the IDH2 R140Q-mutated and wild-type
   AML were not statistically significant in our cohort. In conclusion, we
   identified several co-expressing genes and potential molecular
   mechanisms that are instrumental in IDH2 R140Q-mutated adult de novo
   AML, along with 13 candidate targeted therapeutic drugs.

   divided according to the anatomic site of the cancer. However, few
   studies have reported the difference between distal and proximal colon
   cancer with regard to molecular mechanism, and especially non-coding RNA
   molecules. In the present study, the data of 186 colon tumour tissues
   and 17 adjacent non-tumour colon tissues in the left colon and 229 colon
   tumour tissues and 21 adjacent non-tumour colon tissues in the right
   colon were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 879
   lncRNAs, 165 miRNAs and 2,028 mRNAs were identified as left-specific
   RNAs [log(2)(fold change)>2, FDR<0.01]. There were 916 lncRNAs, 227
   miRNAs and 2,069 mRNAs identified in right colon cancer. The Kyoto
   Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were analysed for
   2,028 mRNAs from left colon cancer and 2,069 mRNAs from right colon
   cancer. After removing the elements of the intersection from
   side-specific lncRNAs of the left and right, we identified specific
   lncRNAs included exclusively in left or right colon cancer, including
   277 lncRNAs in left colon cancer and 314 lncRNAs in right colon cancer.
   Among these lncRNAs, 20 lncRNAs from the left and 25 lncRNAs from the
   right were revealed to be associated with overall survival. Then, ceRNA
   networks were constructed. There were 18 lncRNAs, 22 miRNAs and 57 mRNAs
   included in the left colon cancer ceRNA network and 21 lncRNAs, 27
   miRNAs and 55 mRNAs included in the right ceRNA network. In total, 15
   lncRNAs were revealed to be significantly related to clinical features,
   two of which were ascertained by testing the mRNA expression of tissues.
   In conclusion, our research aimed to detect the difference between colon
   cancer in the left and the right colon and to assist in the
   identification of new potential biomarkers to be used for diagnostic and
   prognostic purposes.

   progression. However, the mechanism by which lncRNAs function in thyroid
   carcinoma are still unclear. To investigate the role of lncRNAs in the
   tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), we analyzed lncRNA
   data in The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-Seq database. A comparison of
   lncRNAs in cancerous thyroid tissues and normal tissues revealed
   hundreds of differentially expressed lncRNAs. Of 7589 lncRNAs identified
   in 561 thyroid cancer cases (503 cancerous tissues and 58 normal
   tissues), the expression levels of 144 were found to be aberrant (|log2
   fold change| >2 and adjusted P<0.05). The top 10 lncRNAs with the most
   significant differences were LINC01977, RP11-363E7.4, RP3-483K16.4,
   RP11-547D24.1, RUNDC3A-AS1, AC093609.1, CTD-2008L17.2, HAGLROS,
   UNC5B-AS1, and LINC01354. In addition, CTD-2008L17.2, HAGLROS,
   AC093609.1, UNC5B-AS1, and RUNDC3A-AS1 were shown to play vital roles in
   determining the histological cancer type. Furthermore, RP11-547D24.1 and
   UNC5B-AS1 could distinguish patients with different stages of PTC. The
   lncRNA RP11-547D24.1 was validated by loss-of-function assays, revealing
   that downregulation of this lncRNA regulates thyroid tumor cell
   proliferation and apoptosis, invasion, and migration. This study
   demonstrates the potential for using lncRNAs to interpret the
   pathogenesis and development of PTC.

AB In testing differentially expressed genes between tumor and healthy
   tissues, data are usually collected in paired form. However, incomplete
   paired data often occur. While extensive statistical researches exist
   for paired data with incompleteness in both arms, hardly any recent work
   can be found on paired data with incompleteness in single arm. This
   paper aims to fill this gap by proposing some new methods, namely,
   P-value pooling methods and a nonparametric combination test. Simulation
   studies are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed
   methods in terms of type I error and power at small to moderate sample
   sizes. A real data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer
   study is analyzed using the proposed methods.

AB Significant advances in genomics and molecular genetics in recent years
   have reshaped the practice of endocrine pathology. Pangenomic studies,
   including the pioneering ones on papillary thyroid carcinoma,
   phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma from the
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, provided a comprehensive integrated
   genomic analysis of endocrine tumors into distinct molecularly defined
   subtypes. Better understanding of the molecular landscape and more
   accurate definition of biological behavior has been accordingly
   achieved. Nevertheless, how any of these advances are translated into
   routine practice still remains a challenge in the era of precision
   medicine. The challenge for modern pathology is to keep up the pace with
   scientific discoveries by integrating novel concepts in tumor
   classification, molecular genetics, prognostication, and theranostics.
   As an example, pathology plays a role in the identification of
   hereditary disease, while it offers the tools for complementing
   molecular genetics, for example, validation of variants of unknown
   significance deriving from targeted sequencing or whole exome/genome
   sequencing approach. Immunohistochemistry has arisen as a cost-effective
   strategy in the evaluation either of somatic mutations in tumors and/or
   germline mutations in patients with familial cancer syndromes. Herein, a
   comprehensive review focusing on novel and emerging biomarkers is
   presented in order pathologists and other endocrine-related specialists
   to remain updated and become aware of potential pitfalls and limitations
   in the field of endocrine pathology.

AB In this study, we aimed to explore the expression profiles of some known
   functional lncRNAs in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAD) and to screening
   the potential prognostic makers, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA)-esophageal carcinoma (ESCA). Results showed that DLEU2 is a high
   potential OS related marker among 73 functional lncRNAs. DLEU2 and its
   intronic miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression were significantly upregulated
   in EAD compared with adjacent normal tissues. However, miR-15a and
   miR-16-1 expression were only weakly correlated with DLEU2 expression.
   Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that DLEU2 expression,
   but not miR-15a or miR-16-1 expression is an independent prognostic
   marker in terms of OS (HR: 1.688, 95% CI: 1.085-2.627, p=0.020) in EAD
   patients. The exon 9 of DLEU2 is very strongly co-expressed with DLEU2
   (Pearson's r=0.96) and showed better predictive value than total DLEU2
   expression in predicting the OS of EAD patients. Multivariate analysis
   confirmed its independent prognostic value (HR: 1.970, 95% CI:
   1.266-3.067, p=0.003), after adjustment of histologic grade,
   pathological stages and the presence of residual tumor. By checking the
   methylation status of DLEU2 gene, we excluded the possibility of the
   influence of two CpG sites near the DLEU2 exon 9 locus on its
   expression. In addition, although copy number alterations (CNAs) were
   observed DLEU2 gene, heterozygous loss (-1), low-level copy gain (+1)
   and high-level amplification (+2) had no significant association with
   DLEU2 transcription. Based on these findings, we infer that DLEU2 exon 9
   expression might serve as a valuable biomarker of unfavorable OS in EAD
   patients.

   study, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and observed
   SUMO1P3 expression was increased in both lung squamous cell carcinoma
   and lung adenocarcinoma. Then, we confirmed that SUMO1P3 expression was
   significantly increased in NSCLC cancer tissues and cell lines.
   Meanwhile, the expression levels of SUMO1P3 expression in metastatic
   lymph node specimens were strikingly elevated in comparison to primary
   NSCLC tissue specimens. Then, we found high SUMO1P3 expression was
   correlated with late clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, distant
   metastasis and poor differentiated degree. In the survival analysis of
   TCGA, we observed that SUMO1P3 expression had no association with
   overall survival and disease free survival in NSCLC patients. There was
   a statistically negative correlation between SUMO1P3 expression and
   miR-136 expression in NSCLC tissues. Moreover, miR-136 directly bound to
   SUMO1P3, and SUMO1P3 negatively regulated miR-136 expression in NSCLC
   cells. Furthermore, SUMO1P3 promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion
   via regulating miR-136. In conclusion, SUMO1P3 functions as
   metastasis-associated lncRNA in NSCLC.

AB Background Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 3 (CDKL3) is a putative protein
   serine kinase and plays an important role in the regulation of cell
   growth and/or differentiation. However, studies on the function of CDKL3
   in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is limited. In our study,
   we explored the role and prognosis of CDKL3 in ESCC and underlying
   mechanism. Materials and methods The expression of CDKL3 was
   investigated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
   reaction and immunohistochemical staining. CDKL3 expression was
   downregulated by the RNAi-mediated knockdown. The functions of CDKL3 on
   cell growth were assessed by Celigo image cytometry, MTT assay,
   cell-cycle analysis, Annexin V assay, and caspase-3/7 activity analysis.
   The effect of CDKL3 on cellular invasive was investigated by the
   Transwell assay. Pathscan Stress Signaling Antibody Array was used to
   study the underlying mechanism. Additionally, the association between
   the survival and CDKL3 expression in ESCC were evaluated based on the
   TCGA data. Results CDKL3 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues and cell
   lines. TE-1 cells transfected with CDKL3-shRNA-lentivirus significantly
   decreased CDKL3 expression and resulted in inhibiting cell
   proliferation, inducing the S-phase cell-cycle arrest, attenuating
   cellular invasive and increasing cell apoptosis. The expression of
   pERK1/2, p-Akt, p-Smad2, p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, cleaved
   caspase-7, and phospho-Chk1 were significantly decreased by CDKL3
   knockdown. In addition, high expression of CDKL3 was associated with
   shorter overall survival. Conclusion Our findings suggest that higher
   expression of CDKL3 is correlated with poor prognosis in patients with
   ESCC and play a vital role in the malignant phenotype of ESCC cell
   lines, which indicating that CDKL3 may be as a new therapeutic target in
   ESCC.

AB Background Recent scientific evidence has suggested that microRNAs
   (miRNAs) play an important role in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). In
   the current study, we aim to identify a miRNA-related signature as the
   sensitive and novel prognostic biomarkers. Methods We performed a
   comprehensive analysis of the data downloaded from the Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) database. The association between survival outcome and
   miRNA was assessed by the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional
   hazards model. The risk score model was built to evaluate the predicting
   value of miRNA signature. The potential biofunctions and transcription
   factors of target miRNAs were investigated through bioinformatic
   analysis. The result was verified by the quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 32 pairs of PTC and adjacent
   nontumor tissues. In addition, the results were verified by other
   cohorts from gene expression omnibus (GEO) as detected by microarrays.
   Results A total of 1030 miRNAs were identified from the TCGA database.
   Thirty-six key intersection miRNAs were obtained. The associations
   between clinical features and key miRNAs were evaluated. Eventually, a
   two-miRNA signature (hsa-miR-181a-2-3p and hsa-miR-138-1-3p) was
   identified. The power of the miRNA prognostic signature was effective.
   In total, we identified 202 genes that were associated with 2 miRNAs
   above, and the top 10 enriched transcript factors that highly related
   with the target miRNAs were explored. The qRT-PCR and GEO data
   validation were consistent with bioinformatics results. Conclusions A
   tumor-specific miRNA signature was identified, and the joint prognostic
   power was evaluated, which may be potential biomarkers for prognosis of
   PTC. Impact: The two-miRNA signature could become the potential
   prognostic indicator of PTC in the future.

AB Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common adult renal epithelial
   cancer susceptible to metastasis and patients with irresectable RCC
   always have a poor prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have
   recently been documented as having critical roles in the etiology of
   RCC. Nevertheless, the prognostic significance of lncRNA-based signature
   for outcome prediction in patients with RCC has not been well
   investigated. Therefore, it is essential to identify a lncRNA-based
   signature for predicting RCC prognosis. In the current study, we
   comprehensively analyzed the RNA sequencing data of the three main
   pathological subtypes of RCC (kidney renal clear cell carcinoma [KIRC],
   kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma [KIRP], and kidney chromophobe
   carcinoma [KICH]) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and
   identified a 6-lncRNA prognostic signature with the help of a step-wise
   multivariate Cox regression model. The 6-lncRNA signature stratified the
   patients into low- and high-risk groups with significantly different
   prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that predictive
   value of the 6-lncRNA signature was independent of other clinical or
   pathological factors in the entire cohort and in each cohort of RCC
   subtypes. In addition, the three independent prognostic clinical factors
   (including age, pathologic stage III, and stage IV) was also stratified
   into low- and high-risk groups basis on the risk score, and the
   stratification analyses demonstrated that the high-risk score was a poor
   prognostic factor. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the
   6-lncRNA signature is a novel prognostic biomarker for all three
   subtypes of RCC, and can increase the accuracy of predicting overall
   survival.

AB Increasing evidence indicates that the expressions of messenger RNAs
   (mRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) undergo a frequent and
   aberrant change in carcinogenesis and cancer development. But some
   research was carried out on mRNA-lncRNA signatures for prediction of
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. We aimed to establish an
   mRNA-lncRNA signature to improve the ability to predict HCC patients'
   survival. The subjects from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data set were
   randomly divided into two parts: training data set (n = 246) and testing
   data set (n = 124). Using computational methods, we selected eight gene
   signatures (five mRNAs and three lncRNAs) to generate the risk score
   model, which were significantly correlated with overall survival of
   patients with HCC in both training and testing data set. The signature
   had the ability to classify the patients in training data set into a
   high-risk group and low-risk group with significantly different overall
   survival (hazard ratio = 4.157, 95% confidence interval = 2.648-6.526, P
   < 0.001). The prognostic value was further validated in testing data set
   and the entire data set. Further analysis revealed that this signature
   was independent of tumor stage. In addition, Gene Set Enrichment
   Analysis suggested that high risk score group was associated with cell
   proliferation and division related pathways. Finally, we developed a
   well-performed nomogram integrating the prognostic signature and other
   clinical information to predict 3- and 5-year overall survival. In
   conclusion, the prognostic mRNAs and lncRNAs identified in our study
   indicate their potential role in HCC biogenesis. The risk score model
   based on the mRNA-lncRNA may be an efficient classification tool to
   evaluate the prognosis of patients' with HCC.

AB Introduction Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is one of the most fatal
   cancers in the world for early metastasis, extensive invasion, and poor
   prognosis with a 5-year survival rate less than 5%. However, the
   underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, it is urgent to
   explore molecular markers for early diagnosis or therapy target to
   improve the outcome of PAAD. Methods We retrieved transcriptome data as
   well as clinical information from patients with PAAD in The Cancer
   Genome Altas (TCGA) database. Survival time associated microRNAs
   (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were initially identified, followed
   by enrichment analysis (Gene Ontology [GO] and pathway). The
   relationship between survival time associated miRNAs-mRNAs was also
   investigated to discover putative transcriptional control mechanisms of
   PAAD. Finally, by consulting the literature and retrieving the database,
   we found that hsa-miR-495 might have played an important role in PAAD.
   Results In total, 146 miRNAs from 378 miRNAs and 580 mRNA from 17 100
   mRNA, including 328 risk mRNA and 252 protective mRNA, were found to be
   associated with the survival time of PAAD. Eight hundred eighty-eight
   mRNA-miRNA pairs were related to the survival time of PAAD, involving in
   755 mRNAs and 35 miRNAs. We chose 13 miRNAs predicted by target gene in
   the miRanda database for further research. Among these 13 miRNAs,
   hsa-miR-495 was identified as a good biomarker. Through GO and Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, the
   significantly enriched pathways involved in focal adhesion,
   Staphylococcus aureus infection, and Intestinal immune network for
   immunoglobulin A production. And four target genes and 87 pathways of
   the hsa-miR-495 were enriched in PAAD. Interestingly, we found
   hsa-miR-495 with a low expression having a poor overall survival and
   significantly different recurrence rate within 5 years. Conclusion
   Hsa-miR-495 and its target genes may serve as a prognostic and
   predictive marker in PAAD. Further research on the function of the
   hsa-miR-495 and its target genes in the KEGG pathway may provide
   references for treatment of PAAD.

AB It has been proved that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important
   modulators in the tumorigenesis and progression of various malignant
   tumors. Recently, lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 has been reported to be an oncogene
   in several kinds of human cancers. However, the function of FOXD2-AS1 in
   papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has not been well investigated. This
   study aims to explore the biological role and mechanism of FOXD2-AS1 in
   PTC. At first, the expression of FOXD2-AS1 was examined in PTC tissues
   and cell lines with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (qRT-PCR). FOXD2-AS1 was found to observably upregulated in PTC
   tissues and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that
   high expression of FOXD2-AS1 was closely correlated with the unfavorable
   prognosis of patients with PTC. Based on the TCGA data set, KLK7 was
   overexpressed in PTC tumor samples. Our experimental data further
   validated the upregulation of KLK7 in PTC tissues and cell lines.
   Similarly, high level of KLKF was associated with poor prognosis of
   patients with PTC. The positive expression association between FOXD2-AS1
   and KLK7 was analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficient.
   Loss-of-function assays revealed that knockdown of FOXD2-AS1 or KLK7
   greatly inhibited PTC cell proliferation and migration, while induced
   cell apoptosis. Results of mechanism experiments suggested that
   FOXD2-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to enhance
   the expression of KLK7 by sponging miR-485-5p in PTC. Rescue assays were
   conducted to verify the function of FOXD2-AS1/miR-485-5p/KLK7 axis in
   PTC progression.

AB Purpose The dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been
   reported to be correlated to carcinogenesis and cancer progression.
   Endometrial cancer (EC), arising from the endometrium or the inner
   lining of the uterus, is one of the most common gynecological
   malignancies. We aim to explore the prognostic value of the lncRNAs in
   patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) and to identify the
   potential lncRNA signature for predicting survival of patients with EEC.
   Methods We performed a genome-wide analysis of the lncRNA expression
   profiling in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Uterine Corpus Endometrial
   Carcinoma database (408 EEC) to identify the prognosis related lncRNAs
   for the EEC. The patients with EEC were randomly divided into a training
   set (204 for endometrioid) and a testing set (204 for endometrioid). The
   lncRNA signature was identified in the training set, and then
   independently validated in the testing set and the complete set
   (training set plus testing set). Results We developed a nine-lncRNA
   signature-based risk score in the patients with EEC. The risk score
   based on the novel lncRNAs signature was able to separate patients of
   training set into high-and low-risk groups with significantly different
   overall survival and progression-free survival. These can also be
   successfully confirmed in the testing set and complete set. Conclusion A
   nine-lncRNA expression signature was identified and validated which can
   predict EEC patient's survival. These findings may have important
   implications in the understanding of the potential therapeutic methods
   for patients with EEC.

AB BACKGROUND: While microRNAs (miRNAs) were widely considered to repress
   target genes at mRNA and/or protein levels, emerging evidence from in
   vitro experiments has shown that miRNAs can also activate gene
   expression in particular contexts. However, this counterintuitive
   observation has rarely been reported or interpreted in in vivo
   conditions.
   METHODS: We systematically explored the positive correlation between
   miRNA and gene expressions and its potential implications in
   tumorigenesis, based on 8375 patient samples across 31 major human
   cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
   FINDINGS: We found that positive miRNA-gene correlations are
   surprisingly prevalent and consistent across cancer types, and show
   distinct patterns than negative correlations. The top-ranked positive
   correlations are significantly involved in the immune cell
   differentiation and cell membrane signaling related processes, and
   display strong power in stratifying patients in terms of survival rate.
   Although intragenic miRNAs generally tend to co-express with their host
   genes, a substantial portion of miRNAs shows no obvious correlation with
   their host gene plausibly due to non-conservation. A miRNA can
   upregulate a gene by inhibiting its upstream suppressor, or shares
   transcription factors with that gene, both leading to positive
   correlation. The miRNA/gene sites associated with the top-ranked
   positive correlations are more likely to form super-enhancers compared
   to randomly chosen pairs. Wet-lab experiments revealed that positive
   correlations partially remain in in vitro condition.
   INTERPRETATION: Our study brings new insights into the critical role of
   miRNA in gene regulation and the complex mechanisms underlying miRNA
   functions, and reveals both biological and clinical significance of
   miRNA-associated gene activation.

AB With the growing requirement for novel prognostic biomarkers for
   pancreatic cancer, many studies have focused on clinical and/or genomic
   variables. Although many studies have been performed, carbohydrate
   antigen 19-9 is the only biomarker in clinical use. Therefore, the
   present study examined whether gamma-secretase genes, including
   presenilin (PSEN), nicastrin (NCSTN), presenilin enhancer protein 2
   (PSENEN), and anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH1-), could serve as
   prognostic factors for pancreatic cancer. The cohorts selected included
   >100 pancreatic cancer patients. Patient data were downloaded from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE21501). The
   prognostic roles of the gamma-secretase genes were analyzed by several
   survival analysis methods. Among the gamma-secretase genes, the
   prognosis tended to be worse in the 2 cohorts with increasing expression
   of PSEN1, APH1A, and PSENEN, while the remaining genes were the opposite
   in the 2 cohorts. Notably, although the patient characteristics were
   quite different, APH1A was statistically significantly associated with
   prognosis in the 2 cohorts. The hazard ratio of APH1A for overall
   survival was 1.598 (TCGA) and 2.724 (GSE21501). These results contribute
   to the study of gamma-secretase in pancreatic cancer. We believe that
   gamma-secretase, particularly APH1A, will be a new prognostic biomarker
   for pancreatic cancer.

AB Malignant brain tumor domain containing protein 1 (MBTD1) is a member of
   the polycomb group protein family that is associated with tumorigenesis.
   The present study investigated the role of MBTD1 within defined
   clinicopathological parameters and the prognosis of patients with
   prostate cancer (PCa). A human tissue microarray containing samples from
   71 patients with PCa and seven healthy donors was employed for
   immunohistochemistry (IHC). The clinicopathological characteristics and
   prognostic value of MBTD1 were investigated using a dataset of 499
   patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). IHC illustrated that the
   levels of MBTD1 protein were enhanced and markedly associated with
   aggressive clinical stage and advanced tumor invasion, distant
   metastasis and lymph node metastasis in patients with PCa. In the TCGA
   data set, the level of MBTD1 was found to positively correlate with the
   prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score and distant metastasis.
   The multivariate analysis of Cox regression revealed that the levels of
   MBTD1 may act as an independent prognostic factor for low
   non-biochemical, recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, MBTD1 was
   overexpressed in PCa tissues and is associated with aggressive
   clinicopathological characteristics. It may therefore act as a novel
   prognostic factor and diagnostic marker in PCa.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and cancer
   relapse accounts for the majority of cancer mortality. The mechanism is
   still unknown, especially in hereditary lung cancer without known
   actionable mutations. To identify genetic alternations involved in
   hereditary lung cancer and relapse is urgently needed. We collected
   genetic materials from a unique hereditary lung cancer patient's blood,
   first cancer tissue (T1), adjacent normal tissue (N1), relapse cancer
   tissue (T2), and adjacent normal tissue (N2) for whole genome
   sequencing. We identified specific mutations in T1 and T2, and
   attributed them to tumorigenesis and recurrence. These tumor specific
   variants were enriched in antigen presentation pathway. In addition, a
   lung adenocarcinoma cohort from the TCGA dataset was used to confirm our
   findings. Patients with high mutation burdens in tumor specific genes
   had decreased relapse-free survival (P=0.017, n=186). Our study may
   provide important insight for designing immunotherapeutic treatment for
   hereditary lung cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: MiRNAs can regulate gene expression directly or indirectly,
   and long noncoding RNAs as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs) can bind to
   miRNAs competitively and affect mRNA expression. The ceRNA network is
   still unclear in breast cancer. In this study, a ceRNA network was
   constructed, and new treatment and prognosis targets and biomarkers for
   breast cancer were explored.
   METHODS: A total of 1096 cancer tissues and 112 adjacent normal tissues
   to cancer from the TCGA database were used to screen out significant
   differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs), lncRNAs (DELs), and miRNAs
   (DEMis) to construct a ceRNA network. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
   were used to predict potential functions. Survival analysis was
   performed to predict which functions were significant for prognosis.
   RESULTS: From the analysis, 2139 DEMs, 1059 DELs, and 84 DEMis were
   obtained. Targeting predictions for DEMis-DELs and DEMis-DEMs can yield
   26 DEMs, 90 DELs, and 18 DEMis. We performed GO enrichment analysis, and
   the results showed that the upregulated DEMs were involved in
   nucleosomes, extracellular regions, and nucleosome assembly, while the
   downregulated DEMs were mainly involved in Z disk, muscle contraction,
   and structural constituents of muscle. KEGG pathway analysis was
   performed on all DEMs, and the pathways were enriched in retinol
   metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and tyrosine metabolism.
   Through survival analysis of the ceRNA network, we identified four DEMs,
   two DELs, and two DEMis that were significant for poor prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that constructing a ceRNA network and
   performing survival analysis on the network could screen out new
   significant treatment and prognosis targets and biomarkers.

AB Alternative splicing (AS) and the regulation of AS by splicing factors
   play critical roles in cancer. Plant homeodomain (PHD)-finger domain
   protein PHF5A, a critical splicing factor involved in AS, has been
   demonstrated to play an oncogenic role in glioblastoma multiforme and
   breast cancer, but its biological function in lung cancer remains
   unclear. In the present study, we systematically analyzed the biological
   function and clinical relevance of PHF5A in non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC). We found that PHF5A was significantly upregulated in NSCLC
   tumors compared with normal tissues in both TCGA data set and tissue
   microarrays. Upregulation of PHF5A was negatively correlated to the
   overall survival (OS) of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients.
   Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments confirmed that PHF5A
   functioned as an oncoprotein by promoting LUAD cell proliferation,
   migration and invasion, inducing G0/G1 cell cycle progression and
   inhibiting cisplatin-induced apoptosis. RNA-seq analysis identified many
   essential genes whose AS was dysregulated by PHF5A, including cell
   cycle-associated genes such as SKP2, CHEK2, ATR and apoptosis-associated
   genes such as API5 and BCL2L13. Additionally, pladienolide, a small
   molecular inhibitor of PHF5A, inhibited LUAD cell proliferation in a
   dose-dependent manner and induced AS changes similar to PHF5A knockdown.
   In conclusion, we validated that PHF5A played an oncogenic role via AS
   in LUAD and suggested that PHF5A might serve as a potential drug target
   with a promising anticancer therapeutic effect.

AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate the roles of the homeodomain-interacting
   protein kinase (HIPK) family of proteins in pancreatic cancer prognosis
   and the possible molecular mechanism.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of HIPK family genes and their
   roles in pancreatic cancer prognosis were analysed by using The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA). The roles of HIPK2 in pancreatic cancer
   proliferation and glycolysis were tested by overexpression of HIPK2 in
   pancreatic cancer cells, followed by cell proliferation assay, glucose
   uptake analysis and Seahorse extracellular flux analysis. The mechanism
   of action of HIPK2 in pancreatic cancer proliferation and glycolysis was
   explored by examining its effect on the ERK/cMyc axis.
   RESULTS: Decreased HIPK2 expression indicated worse prognosis of
   pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of HIPK2 in pancreatic cancer cells
   decreased cell proliferation and attenuated aerobic glycolysis, which
   sustained proliferation of cancer cells. HIPK2 decreased cMyc protein
   levels and expression of cMyc-targeted glycolytic genes. cMyc was a
   mediator that regulated HIPK2-induced decrease in aerobic glycolysis.
   HIPK2 regulated cMyc protein stability via ERK activation, which
   phosphorylated and controlled cMyc protein stability.
   CONCLUSIONS: HIPK2 suppressed proliferation of pancreatic cancer in part
   through inhibiting the ERK/cMyc axis and related aerobic glycolysis.

AB Assessment of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) for response stratification
   of cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors is emerging
   as a new biomarker. Commonly defined as the total number of exonic
   somatic mutations, TMB approximates the amount of neoantigens that
   potentially are recognized by the immune system. While whole exome
   sequencing (WES) is an unbiased approach to quantify TMB, implementation
   in diagnostics is hampered by tissue availability as well as time and
   cost constrains. Conversely, panel-based targeted sequencing is nowadays
   widely used in routine molecular diagnostics, but only very limited data
   are available on its performance for TMB estimation. Here, we evaluated
   three commercially available larger gene panels with covered genomic
   regions of 0.39 Megabase pairs (Mbp), 0.53 Mbp and 1.7 Mbp using i) in
   silico analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data and ii) wet-lab
   sequencing of a total of 92 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
   cancer samples grouped in three independent cohorts (non-small cell lung
   cancer, NSCLC; colorectal cancer, CRC; and mixed cancer types) for which
   matching WES data were available. We observed a strong correlation of
   the panel data with WES mutation counts especially for the gene panel
   >1Mbp. Sensitivity and specificity related to TMB cutpoints for
   checkpoint inhibitor response in NSCLC determined by wet-lab experiments
   well reflected the in silico data. Additionally, we highlight potential
   pitfalls in bioinformatics pipelines and provide recommendations for
   variant filtering. In summary, our study is a valuable data source for
   researchers working in the field of immuno-oncology as well as for
   diagnostic laboratories planning TMB testing.

AB BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma is one of the common carcinomas in the
   female reproductive system. It is reported that miR-204-5p is
   down-regulated in endometrial carcinoma. However, the mechanism and key
   pathways of miR-204-5p in endometrial carcinoma have not been clarified.
   MATERIAL/METHODS: We evaluated the expression profiles and prognostic
   value of miR-204-5p expression in endometrial carcinoma by using
   bioinformatics analysis of a public dataset from TCGA. Drug of
   endometrial carcinoma from DrugBank, GO analysis, KEGG analysis, PPI
   network, mutation, as well as assessment of the prognostic significance
   were performed to the overlapping target genes of miR-204-5p in
   endometrial carcinoma. The relative expression levels of miR-204-5p
   target genes in endometrial carcinoma, including SF3B1, FBXW7, SPOP, and
   BRD4, were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-qPCR).
   RESULTS: First, through DrugBank website, we obtained target drugs for
   endometrial carcinoma. MiR-204-5p expression was found to be lower in
   the endometrial carcinoma tissues than in adjacent normal tissues from
   TCGA. Next, we identified 143 genes as potential targets of miR-204-5p.
   Then, through GO enrichment analysis, KEGG signaling pathway and PPI
   analysis, we revealed the key networks in endometrial carcinoma. Next,
   mutation and assessment of the prognostic significance of endometrial
   carcinoma were obtained. At last, in endometrial carcinoma, the relative
   expression of SF3B1 and BRD4 increased, and the relative expression of
   FBXW7 decreased.
   CONCLUSIONS: MiR-204-5p is down-regulated in endometrial carcinoma and
   affects the prognostic significance of endometrial carcinoma, which
   might play an important role in the tumorigenesis of endometrial
   carcinoma.

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most fatal cancers in the world.
   Thousands of biomarkers have been explored that might be related to
   survival and prognosis via database mining. However, the prediction
   effect of single gene biomarkers is not specific enough. Increasing
   evidence suggests that gene signatures are emerging as a possible better
   alternative. We aimed to develop a novel gene signature to improve the
   prognosis prediction of GC. Using the messenger RNA (mRNA)-mining
   approach, we performed mRNA expression profiling in a large GC cohort (n
   = 375) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Gene Set Enrichment
   Analysis (GSEA) was performed, and we recovered genes related to the
   G2/M checkpoint, which we identified with a Cox proportional regression
   model. We identified a set of five genes (MARCKS, CCNF, MAPK14, INCENP,
   and CHAF1A), which were significantly associated with overall survival
   (OS) in the test series. Based on this five-gene signature, the test
   series patients could be classified into high-risk or low-risk
   subgroups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the
   prognostic power of this five-gene signature was independent of clinical
   features. In conclusion, we developed a five-gene signature related to
   the cell cycle that can predict survival for GC. Our findings provide
   novel insight that is useful for understanding cell cycle mechanisms and
   for identifying patients with GC with poor prognoses.

AB Currently, research on genome-scale epigenetic modifications for
   studying the pathogenesis of lung cancer is lacking. Aberrant DNA
   methylation, as the most common and important modification in
   epigenetics, is an important means of regulating genomic function and
   can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung
   squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In this paper, methylation information
   and gene expression data from patients with LUSC were extracted from the
   TCGA database. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were used to
   screen abnormally methylated genes related to the prognosis of LUSC. The
   relationship between key DNA methylation sites and the transcriptional
   expression of LUSC-related genes was explored. A prognostic risk model
   constructed by four abnormally methylated genes (VAX1, CH25H, AdCyAP1,
   and Irx1) was used to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients. Also, the
   methylation levels of the key gene IRX1 are significantly correlated
   with the prognosis and correlated with the methylation of the site
   cg09232937 and cg10530883. This study is based on high-throughput data
   mining and provides an effective bioinformatics basis for further
   understanding the pathogenesis and prognosis of LUSC, which has
   important theoretical significance for follow-up studies on LUSC.

   algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and hierarchical
   clustering were utilized to group the samples into three clusters that
   showed a different prognosis. To identify the relationship between the
   clustered groups and different histoclinical features, different
   statistical methods were used. The functions of LINC01234 and MIR210HG
   were investigated with the help of the public database. The results
   showed that the expression levels of lncRNAs were able to distinguish
   the tumor samples from the normal tissues and in further they were able
   to predict the prognosis of the patients. We proposed two potential
   lncRNAs, which might serve as a biomarker or therapeutic targets.
   LINC01234 can be a good biomarker. In contrast, MIR210HG participated in
   the progression of colorectal adenocarcinoma by regulating hypoxia. It
   might function through an lncRNA-microRNA-messenger RNA regulatory
   network with MIR210 and RASSF7.

AB Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common malignant tumor with poor
   clinical outcome among women. Identification of novel biomarkers could
   be beneficial for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of CC. This study
   aimed to identify prognostic biomarkers for the prediction of prognostic
   status of CC patients, and explore the effect of the corresponding
   methylated genes in the occurrence and development of CC. The
   methylation microarray data of CC was extracted from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The methylation genes associated with the
   prognostic status were identified based on the information of the
   relapse-free survival (RFS) of the CC patients. The prognostic gene
   pairs were further identified. Then, the prognostic signature was
   identified by the forward search algorithm based on the C-index method.
   The results were validated by independent dataset. Finally, the
   functional analysis was performed on the methylation genes. A total of
   276 methylation genes and 2508 gene pairs associated with the prognostic
   status of the CC were identified. A signature composed of eight
   methylation gene pairs was obtained to predict the prognostic status of
   cervical patients. A series of genes that played an important role in
   the occurrence and development of CC were obtained by the functional
   enrichment analysis. To summary, a prognostic signature consisting of
   eight methylation gene pairs was obtained. Of note, the CD28 and PTEN
   gene pair were found to play important roles in the occurrence and
   development of CC.

AB Gastric cancer (GC) is a lethal disease, and among its variety of
   etiological factors, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the
   strongest risk factor. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms
   underlying H. pylori-related GC need further elucidation. We
   investigated the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network differences
   between H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (-) GC. The long noncoding RNA
   (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data
   from 32 adjacent noncancerous samples and 18 H. pylori (+) and 141 H.
   pylori (-) stomach adenocarcinoma samples were downloaded from the TCGA
   database. After construction of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networks of H.
   pylori (+) and H. pylori (-) GC, Panther and Kobas databases were used
   to analyze the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Finally, survival analysis was used to discover
   the key genes. In H. pylori (+) GC, we identified a total of 1,419
   lncRNAs, 82 miRNAs, and 2,501 mRNAs with differentially expressed
   profiles. In H. pylori (-) GC, 2,225 lncRNAs, 130 miRNAs, and 3,146
   mRNAs were differentially expressed. Furthermore, three unique pathways
   (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and
   Wnt signaling pathway) were enriched in H. pylori (+) GC. According to
   the overall survival analysis, three lncRNAs (AP002478.1, LINC00111, and
   LINC00313) and two mRNAs (MYB and COL1A1) functioned as prognostic
   biomarkers for patients with H. pylori (+) GC. In conclusion, our study
   has identified the differences in ceRNA regulatory networks between H.
   pylori (+) and H. pylori (-) GC and provides a rich candidate reservoir
   for future studies.

AB Colon cancer is one of the most malignant cancers worldwide. Nearly 20%
   of all colon cancer patients are diagnosed at stage IV (metastasis).
   However, further study of colon cancer is difficult due to a lack of
   understanding of its pathogenesis. In this study, we acquired
   high-throughput sequence data from TCGA datasets and performed
   integrated bioinformatic analysis including differential gene expression
   analysis, gene ontology and KEGG pathways analysis, protein-protein
   analysis, survival analysis, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
   regression analysis in order to identify a panel of key candidate genes
   involved in the metastasis of colon cancer. We then constructed a
   prognostic signature based on the expression of REG1B, TGM6, NTF4,
   PNMA5, and HOXC13 which could provide significant prognostic value for
   colon cancer.

   analysis of spatially independent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and
   invasive ductal carcinoma samples from the same breast. Results: In VEGF
   pathway, we observed two genes disrupted in DCIS, while another four
   (including ACTN2) mutated in invasive ductal carcinoma. When looked up

   ACTN2somatic mutations and observed a dramatic decrease in the overall
   survival time in ACTN2mutant patients (p=0.0182). A further finding in
   the TCGA database shows that breast cancer patients with≥2 mutated genes
   in VEGF pathways showed worse prognosis (p=0.0013). Conclusion: TCGA
   database and special case could inform each other to reveal DCIS
   developmental rules.

AB Advances in cancer biology have allowed early diagnosis and more
   comprehensive treatment of breast cancer (BC). However, it remains the
   most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide because of its
   strong invasiveness and metastasis. In-depth study of the molecular
   pathogenesis of BC and of relevant prognostic markers would improve the
   quality of life and prognosis of patients. In this study, bioinformatics
   analysis of SNP-related data from BC patients provided in the TCGA
   database revealed that six mutant genes (NCOR1, GATA3, CDH1, ATM, AKT1,
   and PTEN) were significantly associated with the corresponding
   expression levels of the proteins. The proteins were involved in
   multiple pathways related to the development of cancer, including the
   PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, pertinent microRNAs, and the MAPK signaling
   pathway. In addition, overall survival and recurrence-free survival
   analysis revealed the close associations of the expression of GATA3,
   NCOR1, CDH1, and ATM with survival of BC patients. Therefore, detecting
   these gene mutations and exploring their corresponding expression could
   be valuable in predicting the prognosis of patients. The results of the
   high-throughput data mining provide important fundamental bioinformatics
   information and a relevant theoretical basis for further exploring the
   molecular pathogenesis of BC and assessing the prognosis of patients.

AB Although the morbidity and mortality rates of prostate cancer (PCa) are
   considerably high, many PCas are characterized as indolent and slow
   growing, which do not require overtreatment. Overdiagnosis and
   overtreatment of early detected PCa are an emerging problem, owing to a
   lack of biomarkers that detect advanced disease at an earlier stage. In
   this study, RNA-Seq data of 57,045 genes for 495 PCa samples and 52
   normal samples in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were
   downloaded. Subsequently, we performed weighted gene coexpression
   network analysis to identify the Gleason score-related coexpression gene
   module, and further screened out oncogenes and tumor suppressors that
   were upregulated or downregulated in the early stage of PCa as well as
   those related to the clinical prognosis of PCa patients. Based on this
   study, some novel biomarkers were identified for the disease-free
   survival, which are helpful for fast diagnosis and prognosis.

AB OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma is the most common malignant glioma of all
   brain tumours. It is difficult to treat because of its poor response to
   chemotherapy and radiotherapy and high recurrence rate after treatment.
   The aetiology of glioblastoma is a result of disorders of multiple
   factors. Depending on cell signal transduction, these
   glioblastoma-associated factors lead to cell proliferation,
   differentiation and apoptosis. Therefore, investigation of the potential
   factors which involved in the development of glioblastoma could provide
   a new target for the treatment of glioblastoma.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the transcript expression of CLEC5A
   in glioblastoma by accessing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). qRT-PCR was
   performed to detect the RNA expression of genes in cells and tissues,
   and Western blot was used to measure the protein levels (Cyclin D1,
   Bcl-2, BAX, PCNA, MMP2, MMP9, Akt and Akt phosphorylation) in tissues
   and cells. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle and apoptosis
   were measured by CCK-8, transwell and flow cytometry assays,
   respectively. Ki67 level and lung metastasis were determined by
   immunochemistry and H&E staining.
   RESULTS: In this study, we found that CLEC5A was highly upregulated in
   glioblastoma compared to normal brain tissues, which had an opposite
   relation with the overall patient survival. Downregulation of CLEC5A
   could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion via promoting
   apoptosis and G1 arrest. In contrast, overexpression of CLEC5A
   stimulated cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we
   found that CLEC5A level was positively correlated with Akt
   phosphorylation level. Akt inhibitor or agonist could reverse the
   modulation effects of CLEC5A in glioblastoma. Moreover, In vivo results
   suggested that inhibition of CLEC5A significantly reduced tumour size,
   weight, cell proliferation ability and lung metastasis via inhibition of
   phosphorylation Akt.
   CONCLUSION: Both in vitro and in vivo evidences supported that CLEC5A
   was involved in glioblastoma pathogenesis via regulation of PI3K/Akt
   pathway. Thus, CLEC5A might serve as a potential therapeutic target in
   the treatment of glioblastoma in the future.

AB Very young breast cancer patients are more common in Asian countries
   than Western countries and are thought to have worse prognosis than
   older patients. The aim of the current study was to identify molecular
   characteristics of young patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
   breast cancer by analyzing mutations and copy number variants (CNV), and
   by applying expression profiling. The whole exome and transcriptome of
   47 Korean young breast cancer (KYBR) patients (age<35) were analyzed.
   Genomic profiles were constructed using mutations, CNV and differential
   gene expression from sequencing data. Pathway analyses were also
   performed using gene sets to identify biological processes. Our data
   were compared with young ER+ breast cancer patients in The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) dataset. TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3 were highly recurrent
   somatic mutation genes. APOBEC-associated mutation signature was more
   frequent in KYBR compared with young TCGA patients. Integrative
   profiling was used to classify our patients into 3 subgroups based on
   molecular characteristics. Group A showed luminal A-like subtype and
   IGF1R signal dysregulation. Luminal B patients were classified into
   groups B and C, which showed chromosomal instability and enrichment for
   APOBEC3A/B deletions, respectively. Group B was characterized by 11q13
   (CCND1) amplification and activation of the ubiquitin-mediated
   proteolysis pathway. Group C showed 17q12 (ERBB2) amplification and
   lower ER and progesterone receptor expression. Group C was also
   distinguished by immune activation and lower epithelial-mesenchyme
   transition (EMT) degree compared with group B. This study showed that
   integrative genomic profiling could classify very young patients with
   breast cancer into molecular subgroups that are potentially linked to
   different clinical characteristics.

AB BACKGROUND: TONSL has been suggested to function as an oncogene in lung,
   esophageal and cervical cancer. This study was aimed to identify the
   expression of TONSL and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   METHODS: By data mining in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Human
   Protein Atlas (HPA) databases, the expression profile of TONSL, its
   clinical significance, the potential mechanisms of its dysregulation and
   its underlying biological function in HCC were investigated.
   RESULTS: TONSL was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues relative to
   normal liver tissues (P<0.05). High TONSL expression was significantly
   correlated with advanced TNM stage, poorly differentiated tumors,
   vascular invasion, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein expression and a
   worse prognosis (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis further confirmed
   that TONSL overexpression was an independent risk factor for poor
   overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in HCC (all
   P<0.05). Additionally, 16% of HCC cases (n=370) had TONSL DNA
   amplification. The total methylation level of TONSL was moderately and
   negatively correlated with its mRNA expression (P<0.05). TONSL was
   predictively targeted by miR-133b, which was downregulated in HCC and
   negatively related to TONSL mRNA expression (all P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier
   analyses demonstrated that low miR-133b expression was significantly
   associated with poor OS and RFS (all P<0.05). Moreover, gene set
   enrichment analysis revealed that cases with TONSL overexpression were
   enriched in cell cycle regulation pathways (all P<0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: TONSL holds promise for serving as a prognostic biomarker
   for HCC. DNA amplification, hypomethylation and miR-133b downregulation
   could be the mechanisms associated with TONSL upregulation in HCC. TONSL
   might function as an oncogene via cell cycle regulation pathways in HCC.

AB AIM: The present study aims to identify aberrantly methylated and
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in gastric cancer (GC) and explore
   their potential role in the carcinogenesis and development of GC.
   METHODS: The original RNA-Seq, clinical information and Illumina Human
   Methylation 27 Chip data associated with GC were downloaded from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database using the gdc-client tool. The DEGs
   and aberrantly methylated genes (AMGs) were screened with edgeR and
   limma package in R, respectively. The cut-off criteria for DEG
   identification were P<0.05 and fold change (FC) >2.0, and for AMG
   identification were P<0.05 and |t|>2.0. Genes which were both DEGs and
   AMGs were considered to be regulated by aberrant DNA methylation in GC.
   The common genes were used for further functional enrichment analysis in
   the categories of cellular component, molecular function, biological
   process and biological pathway.
   RESULTS: In total 465 genes including 336 down-regulated genes with
   hyper-methylation (DGs-Hyper) and 129 up-regulated genes with
   hypo-methylation (UGs-Hypo) were identified. Cellular component analysis
   showed that these genes were mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and
   plasma membrane. Molecular function and biological process analysis
   indicated that the genes primarily participate in cell communication,
   signal transduction, cell growth/maintenance and function as
   transcription factors, receptor, cell adhesion molecules, and
   transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinases. Biological pathway
   analysis revealed that the genes are involved in some crucial pathways
   including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, IL3-mediated signaling,
   mTOR signaling, VEGF/VEGFR and c-Met signaling. KRT15, INHBA, MATN3, and
   AGT are significantly associated with the prognosis of GC patients.
   CONCLUSION: Our study identified several DEGs regulated by aberrant DNA
   methylation in GC. The mechanism of DNA methylation in the
   carcinogenesis and development of GC could be further explored in these
   genes, especially KRT15, INHBA, MATN3, and AGT.

AB Recent studies have revealed that neurons can promote glioma growth
   through activity-dependent secretion of neurotrophins, especially
   neuroligin-3. It has therefore been suggested that blocking
   neuron-derived neurotrophins may serve as a therapeutic intervention for
   gliomas. Carbonic anhydrase-related proteins 11 and 10 (CA11 and CA10)
   are secreted synaptic proteins which function as neurexin ligands, and
   the gene-encoding CA11 is part of a gene signature associated with
   radiotherapy and prognosis in gliomas. We therefore hypothesized that
   CA11/CA10 might participate in the neuronal activity-dependent
   regulation of glioma growth. In this study, we report that CA11 secreted
   by depolarized cultured neurons within conditioned medium (CM) inhibited
   the growth of glioma cell lines. CM from depolarized neurons inhibited
   CA11 expression in glioma cell lines via the Akt signaling pathway.
   Consistently, CA11 expression was also reduced in clinical glioma
   samples and negatively associated with high histologicalgrade. Low CA11
   expression of gliomas was associated with short survival in four
   independent datasets [repository of brain neoplasia data (REMBRANDT),
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower grade glioma (LGG), GSE4271, and
   GSE42669]. CA11 knockdown promoted cell growth, clone formation, and
   migration; inhibited apoptosis; and increased tumor size in xenografted
   nude mice. Similarly, CA10 and CA10 secreted by depolarized cultured
   neurons also inhibited the growth of glioma cell lines. Low CA10
   expression was associated with short survival in REMBRANDT, TCGA LGG,
   and GEO GSE4271 datasets. Our results suggest that CA11 and CA10
   negatively regulate neuronal activity-dependent glioma growth and
   inhibit glioma aggression. Thus, CA11/CA10 may represent a potential
   therapeutic target for the treatment of gliomas.

AB Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 gene, especially the
   R132H mutation, have been reported to be associated with a better
   prognosis in glioma patients. However, the underlying molecular
   mechanisms are not yet well understood. Many factors may contribute to
   differences in the survival of IDH1 wild-type and IDH1 mutant glioma
   patients, in which immune components play a potentially important role.
   In this study, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the
   Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases, as well as glioma
   patient-derived tumor samples. We found that there was a higher
   infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells in IDH1 mutant glioma
   patients, and this was correlated with a better prognosis. We also
   showed that IDH1-R132 tumor cells had higher expression levels of the
   chemokine CX3CL1. This arises as a result of the conversion of
   alpha-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate by the IDH1 mutant and
   the resultant phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B. Knockdown of
   CX3CL1 decreased the migration of NK cells. In addition, the high levels
   of expression of CX3CL1 were positively correlated with glioma patient
   survival in the TCGA and CGGA databases, and in the clinical samples.
   Overall, our data have identified a novel mechanism in which R132H
   mutation of the IDH1 gene serves as a tumor suppressor by promoting the
   recruitment of NK cells through CX3CL1/CX3CR1 chemotaxis.

AB CONTEXT: Novel tumor markers are urgently needed to better stratify
   adrenocortical cancer (ACC) patients and improve therapies for this
   aggressive neoplasm.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of the
   actin-bundling protein fascin-1 (FSCN1) in adrenocortical tumors.
   DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A local series of 37 malignant/37
   benign adrenocortical tumors at Careggi University Hospital and two
   independent validation ACC cohorts (Cochin, TCGA) from the European
   Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors were studied.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: FSCN1 expression was quantified by
   immunohistochemistry, Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR in ACC
   specimens; overall and disease-free survival associated with FSCN1
   expression were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared with that
   of Ki67 labeling index and tumor stage.
   RESULTS: Despite the low diagnostic power, in the Florence ACC series,
   FSCN1 immunohistochemical detection appeared as an independent
   prognostic factor, also refining results obtained with staging and Ki67
   labeling index. The robust prognostic power of FSCN1 levels was further
   confirmed in two independent ACC cohorts. A positive correlation was
   found between FSCN1 and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), with a
   substantially higher expression of both factors in ACCs at advanced
   stages and with at least one of the three Weiss score parameters
   associated with invasiveness. Moreover, we demonstrated FSCN1 role in
   promoting cell invasion in a human ACC cell line only in the case of
   increased SF-1 dosage.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that FSCN1 is a novel independent
   prognostic marker in ACC and may serve as a potential therapeutic target
   to block tumor spread.

AB LINC00599 has been suggested to be involved in physiological and
   pathological processes including carcinogenesis. However, the clinical
   and prognostic significance of LINC00599 in glioma patients and the
   effect of LINC00599 on glioma cell migration and invasion remain
   unknown. In our results, we first observe the expression of LINC00599 in
   31 types of human cancers including tumor tissues and corresponding
   normal tissues at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and found
   that LINC00599 expression levels were only reduced in lower grade glioma
   (LGG) tissues and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissues compared with
   normal brain tissues. Moreover, we confirmed levels of LINC00599
   expression were decreased in glioma tissues and cell lines compared with
   matched adjacent normal tissues and normal human astrocytes (NHAs),
   respectively. Meanwhile, we found that glioma tissues with WHO III-IV
   grade exhibited lower levels of LINC00599 expression than glioma tissues
   with I-II grade. The survival analysis at TCGA data showed low LINC00599
   expression was associated with poor disease-free survival and overall
   survival in glioma patients. In vitro study suggested up-regulation of
   LINC00599 depressed glioma cell migration and invasion through
   regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In
   conclusion, LINC00599 acts as a tumor-suppressing long non-coding RNA
   (lncRNA) in glioma.

AB The MIR100HG expression was observed to be up-regulated or
   down-regulated in human cancer tissues depending on tumor types.
   However, there was no report about the role of MIR100HG in gastric
   cancer. In our study, we first found levels of MIR100HG expression were
   increased in gastric cancer cell lines and tissue samples compared with
   normal gastric epithelial cell line and adjacent normal gastric mucosa
   tissue samples, respectively. Moreover, high MIR100HG expression was
   positively associated with clinical stage, tumor invasion, lymph node
   metastasis, and distant metastasis in gastric cancer patients. Survival
   analysis showed MIR100HG expression was negative correlated with
   clinical outcome in gastric cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database or our study, and high MIR100HG expression served as an
   independent poor prognostic factor for gastric cancer patient's overall
   survival. The study in vitro suggested down-regulation of MIR100HG
   expression inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in
   gastric cancer. In conclusion, MIR100HG is a credible prognostic
   biomarker and functions as an oncogenic lncRNA in gastric cancer.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of
   cancer-related mortality worldwide. Recently, ubiquitin-conjugating
   enzyme E2C (UBE2C) has been reported to be over-expressed in human
   cancers and act as a potential oncogene. However, little is known about
   the functional roles of UBE2C in HCC progression. In the present study,
   analysis of UBE2C mRNA expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   dataset reveals that significantly higher UBE2C mRNA levels was found in
   HCC tissues and associated with higher HCC grade. Elevated UBE2C mRNA
   levels in HCC indicated worsened survival probabilities. Through
   performing loss-of-function assays, we demonstrated that knockdown of
   UBE2C expression obviously suppressed proliferation, migration, and
   invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Moreover, HCC cells with UBE2C knockdown
   showed higher sensitivity for the treatment of chemotherapeutic drug,
   including adriamycin (ADR) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Silencing of UBE2C
   also increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib, an approved
   treatment for patients with advanced-stage HCC. Our findings strongly
   suggest that UBE2C emerges as a marker for prognosis in HCC, and
   blocking UBE2C may be a novel strategy for HCC therapies.

AB BackgroundThe expression of PD-L1 has been reported in ovarian cancer.
   However, the prognostic role of PD-L1 expression in ovarian carcinoma
   remained controversial. This study was performed to assess the
   prognostic value of PD-L1 expression on ovarian cancer.MethodsThe
   PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to
   identify available publications. The pooled odds ratio (OR) or hazard
   ratios (HRs: multivariate analysis) with their 95% confidence intervals
   (95% CIs) were calculated in this analysis. A bioinformatics study based
   on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sequencing and microarray datasets was
   used to further validate the results of PD-L1 mRNA expression.
   Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were performed to evaluate the
   prognostic effect of PD-L1 mRNA expression.ResultsTwelve studies with
   1630 ovarian cancers regarding PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression were
   identified. Meta-analysis showed that PD-L1 protein expression was not
   associated with tumor grade, clinical stage, lymph node status, tumor
   histology, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).
   TCGA data showed no association between PD-L1 mRNA expression and
   ovarian cancer. Further validation using microarray data suggested that
   no association between PD-L1 mRNA expression and OS was found in large
   independent patient cohorts (1310 cases). PD-L1 mRNA expression was
   significantly linked to worse PFS in 1228 patients with ovarian cancer
   (227458_at: HR=1.55, 95% CI=1.28-1.88, P<0.001; 223834_at: HR=1.41, 95%
   CI=1.14-1.75, P=0.0015).ConclusionsMeta-analysis showed that PD-L1 may
   not be a prognostic factor for ovarian cancer. But a bioinformatics
   study showed that PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with
   worse PFS of ovarian cancer. More clinical studies are needed to further
   validate these findings.

AB Background: Oral cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide.
   Despite that the oral cavity is easily accessible for clinical
   examinations, oral cancers are often not promptly diagnosed.
   Furthermore, to date no effective biomarkers are available for oral
   cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers
   able to improve both diagnostic and prognostic strategies. In this
   context, the development of innovative high-throughput technologies for
   molecular and epigenetics analyses has generated a huge amount of data
   that may be used for the identification of new cancer biomarkers.
   Methods: In the present study, GEO DataSets and TCGA miRNA profiling
   datasets were analyzed in order to identify miRNAs with diagnostic and
   prognostic significance. Furthermore, several computational approaches
   were adopted to establish the functional roles of these miRNAs. Results:
   The analysis of datasets allowed for the identification of 11 miRNAs
   with a potential diagnostic role for oral cancer. Additionally, eight
   miRNAs associated with patients' prognosis were also identified; six
   miRNAs predictive of patients' overall survival (OS) and one,
   hsa-miR-let.7i-3p, associated with tumor recurrence. Conclusion: The
   integrated analysis of different miRNA expression datasets allows for
   the identification of a set of miRNAs that, after validation, may be
   used for the early detection of oral cancers.

AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in colorectal cancer
   (CRC). And lncRNA RP11-138J23.1 (CRCAL-3) was previously reported as a
   candidate regulator of CRC development. But its regulating functions
   have not been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data
   from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 253 CRC patients treated in our
   hospital to assess expression dysregulation of CRCAL-3, and the
   correlation between CRCAL-3 expression and disease progression. Further,
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on different cell lines and
   knockdown experiments by small interfering RNA were performed to assess
   functions of CRCAL-3 in proliferation and migration of CRC cells. As a
   result, analyses on TCGA datasets showed an upregulated CRCAL-3
   expression in 14 solid tumors, including CRC. PCR assay on 253 cases of
   CRC tissue and 114 cases of normal adjacent tissue confirmed this
   expression upregulation. Also, CRCAL-3 expression was exhibited by
   survival analyses on the 253 CRC patients, to have a negative
   correlation with patients' overall and progression-free survivals. PCR
   assay on different cell lines showed that CRC cells expressed a higher
   level of CRCAL-3, compared with normal colonic epithelial cells. In
   vitro knockdown of CRCAL-3 resulted in an obvious retardation of
   proliferation and migration in two CRC cell lines (HCT116 and DLD-1).
   Moreover, CRCAL-3 knockdown was observed in xenograft models to repress
   cell proliferation and enhance cisplatin sensitivity. Taking these
   results together, CRCAL-3 emerged as a biomarker for early diagnosis,
   prognosis prediction, and individualized treatment of CRC.

AB For many complex diseases, gene-environment (G-E) interactions have
   independent contributions beyond the main G and E effects. Despite
   extensive effort, it still remains challenging to identify G-E
   interactions. With the long accumulation of experiments and data, for
   many biomedical problems of common interest, there are existing studies
   that can be relevant and informative for the identification of G-E
   interactions and/or main effects. In this study, our goal is to identify
   G-E interactions (as well as their corresponding main G effects) under a
   joint statistical modeling framework. Significantly advancing from the
   existing studies, a quasi-likelihood-based approach is developed to
   incorporate information mined from the existing literature. A
   penalization approach is adopted for identification and selection and
   respects the "main effects, interactions" hierarchical structure.
   Simulation shows that, when the existing information is of high quality,
   significant improvement can be observed. On the other hand, when the
   existing information is less informative, the proposed method still
   performs reasonably (and hence demonstrates a certain degree of
   "robustness"). The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on
   cutaneous melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme demonstrates the
   practical applicability of the proposed approach and also leads to
   sensible findings.

AB Somatic mutations in cancer can result in neoantigens against which
   patients can be vaccinated. The quest for tumor specific neoantigens has
   yielded no targets that are common to all tumors, yet foreign to healthy
   cells. Single base pair substitutions (SNVs) at best can alter 1 amino
   acid which can result in a neoantigen; with the exception of rare
   site-specific oncogenic driver mutations (such as RAS) such mutations
   are private. Here, we describe a source of common neoantigens induced by
   frame shift mutations, based on analysis of 10,186 TCGA tumor samples.
   We find that these frame shift mutations can produce long neoantigens.
   These are completely new to the body, and indeed recent evidence
   suggests that frame shifts can be highly immunogenic. We report that
   many different frame shift mutations converge to the same small set of
   3' neo open reading frame peptides (NOPs), all encoded by the
   Neo-ORFeome. We find that a fixed set of only 1,244 neo-peptides in as
   much as 30% of all TCGA cancer patients. For some tumor classes this is
   higher; e.g. for colon and cervical cancer, peptides derived from only
   ten genes (saturated at 90 peptides) can be applied to 39% of all
   patients. 50% of all TCGA patients can be achieved at saturation (using
   all those peptides in the library found more than once). A
   pre-fabricated library of vaccines (peptide, RNA or DNA) based on this
   set can provide off the shelf, quality certified, 'personalized'
   vaccines within hours, saving months of vaccine preparation. This is
   crucial for critically ill cancer patients with short average survival
   expectancy after diagnosis.

AB We report here that CYB5D2 is associated with tumor suppression function
   in breast cancer (BC). CYB5D2 expression was significantly reduced in
   tamoxifen resistant MCF7 cells and in MCF7 cell-derived xenografts
   treated with TAM. CYB5D2 overexpression induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells;
   CYB5D2 knockdown enhanced MCF7 cell proliferation. Using the TCGA and
   Curtis datasets within the Oncomine database, CYB5D2 mRNA expression was
   downregulated in primary BCs vs breast tissues and HER2-positive or
   triple negative BCs vs estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BCs. Using the
   TCGA and Metabric datasets (n = 817 and n = 2509) within cBioPortal, 660
   and 4891 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in relation to CYB5D2
   were identified. These DEGs were enriched in pathways governing cell
   cycle progression, progesterone-derived oocyte maturation,
   oocyte-meiosis, estrogen-mediated S-phase entry, and DNA metabolism.
   CYB5D2 downregulation decreased overall survival (OS, p = 0.0408). A
   CYB5D2-derived 21-gene signature was constructed and robustly correlated
   with OS shortening (p = 5.72e-12), and independently predicted BC deaths
   (HR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.08-1.52; p = 0.004) once adjusting for known
   clinical factors. CYB5D2 reductions displayed relationship with
   mutations in PIK3CA, GATA3, MAP3K1, CDH1, TP53 and RB1. Impressively,
   85% (560/659) of TP53 mutations occurred in the 21-gene
   signature-positive BC. Collectively, we provide the first evidence that
   CYB5D2 is a candidate tumor suppressor of BC.

AB Background: Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are a newly identified
   type of regulatory RNA. Accumulating evidence suggests that ceRNAs play
   an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Thus,
   ceRNA dysregulation may represent an important molecular mechanism
   underlying cancer progression and poor prognosis. In this study, we
   aimed to identify ceRNAs that may serve as potential biomarkers for
   early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
   Methods: We performed differential gene expression analysis on TCGA-LUAD
   datasets to identify differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, lncRNAs, and
   miRNAs at different tumor stages. Based on the ceRNA hypothesis and
   considering the synergistic or feedback regulation of ceRNAs, a
   lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. Functional analysis was
   performed using gene ontology term and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
   and KOBAS 2.0 software. Transcription factor (TF) analysis was carried
   out to identify direct targets of the TFs associated with LUAD
   prognosis. Identified DE genes were validated using gene expression
   omnibus (GEO) datasets.
   Results: Based on analysis of TCGA-LUAD datasets, we obtained 2,610 DE
   mRNAs, 915 lncRNAs, and 125 miRNAs that were common to different tumor
   stages (vertical bar log(2)(Fold change)vertical bar >= 1, false
   discovery rate < 0.01), respectively. Functional analysis showed that
   the aberrantly expressed mRNAs were closely related to tumor
   development. Survival analyses of the constructed ceRNA network modules
   demonstrated that five of them exhibit prognostic significance. The five
   ceRNA interaction modules contained one lncRNA (FENDRR), three mRNAs
   (EPAS1, FOXF1, and EDNRB), and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-148a, hsa-miR-195,
   hsa-miR-196b, and hsa-miR-301b). The aberrant expression of one lncRNA
   and three mRNAs was verified in the LUAD GEO dataset. Transcription
   factor analysis demonstrated that EPAS1 directly targeted 13 DE mRNAs.
   Conclusion: Our observations indicate that lncRNA-related ceRNAs and TFs
   play an important role in LUAD. The present study provides novel
   insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying LUAD pathogenesis.
   Furthermore, our study facilitates the identification of potential
   biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognosis of LUAD and therapeutic
   targets for its treatment.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIM: Extensive research has revealed that microRNAs
   (miRNAs) play a principle role in cancer, and miRNAs associated with
   specific cancers have also been identified. The role of microRNA
   (miR)-302b-5p, which is one of the miRNAs reported in association with
   cancer, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. Thus, the
   present study aimed to reveal the expression and potential molecule
   mechanism of miR-302b-5p in HCC.
   METHODS: An extensive meta-analysis of data from real-time reverse
   transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Gene
   Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress microarrays was used to determine
   the expression of miR-302b-5p in HCC tissue samples and non-cancerous
   liver tissue samples. The sensitivity and specificity of miR-302b-5p as
   an indicator of HCC was estimated by plotting the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) and summarized ROC (sROC). Gene Ontology and Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were employed to
   unravel the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of miR-302b-5p
   in HCC. Further, the putative target genes of miR-302b-5p were harvested
   based on the predicted genes and differentially expressed genes in HCC.
   Finally, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built to
   determine the hub genes.
   RESULTS: According to the RT-qPCR results, the expression of miR-302b-5p
   was pronouncedly decreased in 39 HCC tissue samples as compared to 39
   non-cancerous liver tissue samples. The standard mean difference (SMD)
   values of all the samples used in the meta-analysis also indicated lower
   miR-302b-5p expression in the 558 HCC tissue samples than in the 286
   non-cancerous liver tissue samples. ROC and sROC analyses showed that
   miR-302b-5p had good specificity and sensitivity for distinguishing HCC
   tissue from non-cancerous liver tissue. Bioinformatics analyses
   identified 227 putative genes, and these genes were evidently enriched
   in the processes of organelle fission, chromosome and chromatin binding
   and were centralized in a "lysosome" pathway. The PPI network indicated
   that DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) was the most prominent hub gene
   of miR-302b-5p in HCC. Interestingly, according to the TCGA and
   Genotype-Tissue Expression databases, the mRNA and protein expression of
   TOP2A were both elevated in HCC tissue samples as compared to
   non-cancerous liver tissue samples, and the overall survival and
   disease-free survival revealed that a high level of TOP2A might reflect
   poor HCC outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that miR-302b-5p might suppress HCC
   progression, and TOP2A might be a potential target of miR-302b-5p in
   HCC. However, in-depth in vivo and in vitro experiments are required to
   verify these findings and explore the mechanisms involved.

AB The pathological diagnosis of lung cancer has largely been based on the
   morphological features observed microscopically. Recent innovations in
   molecular and genetic technology enable us to compare conventional
   histological classifications, protein expression status, and gene
   abnormalities. The introduction of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   project along with the widespread use of the next-generation sequencer
   (NGS) have facilitated access to enormous data regarding the molecular
   profiles of lung cancer. The World Health Organization classification of
   lung cancer, which was revised in 2015, is based on this progress in
   molecular pathology; moreover, immunohistochemistry has come to play a
   larger role in diagnosis. In this article, we focused on genetic and
   epigenetic abnormalities in non-small cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma and
   squamous cell carcinoma), neuroendocrine tumor (including carcinoids,
   small cell carcinoma, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma), and
   carcinoma with rare histological subtypes. In addition, we summarize the
   therapeutic targeted reagents that are currently available and
   undergoing clinical trials. A good understanding of the morphological
   and molecular profiles will be necessary in routine practice when the
   NGS platform is widely used.

AB PURPOSE: Breast cancer (BC) remains a serious health threat for women
   due to its high incidence and the trend of rejuvenation. Accumulating
   evidence has highlighted that microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs
   (mRNAs) could play important roles in various biological processes
   involved in the pathogenesis of BC. The present study aimed to identify
   potentialprognostic biomarkers associated with BC.
   METHODS: Here, original gene expression profiles of patients with BC was
   downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. TargetScan,
   miRDB, and miRTarBase databases were used to predict the target genes of
   prognostic-related differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). Subsequently,
   functional enrichment analysis and topological analysis were performed
   on the overlaps of target genes and differentially expressed mRNAs
   (DEGs), and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to predict prognosis-related
   target genes to identify prognostic biomarkers.
   RESULTS: A total of 218 DEMs and 2222 DEGs were extracted in which eight
   miRNAs were associated with prognosis, and 278 target DEGs were screened
   out incorporated into functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein
   interaction network visualization studies. Additionally, five hub genes
   (CXCL12, IGF1, LEF1, MMP1, and RACGAP1) were observed as potential
   biomarkers for BC prognosis through survival analysis.
   CONCLUSION: We performed a distinctive correlation analysis of
   miRNA-mRNA in BC patients, and identified eight miRNAs and five hub
   genes may be effective biomarkers for the prognosis of BC patients.

AB Background: This study is aimed to investigate the prognostic
   significance of the expression of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor
   (GPER) in gastric cancer tissue using bioinformatics data and
   immunohistochemistry.
   Material/Methods: Expression of GPER mRNA in gastric cancer tissues and
   normal adjacent tissues was investigated using data from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and Oncomine
   database. Kaplan-Meier Plotter identified the association between GPER
   mRNA and prognosis. Correlation between GPER mRNA and DNA methylation
   used the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and the MethHC website. Genes
   co-expressed with GPER were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   Stomach Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-STAD) underwent FunRich analysis.
   Immunohistochemistry and Western blot evaluated GPER protein expression
   in tissue microarrays (TMAs) and gastric cancer cell lines.
   Results: GPER mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower in
   gastric cancer tissue and cells lined when compared with normal tissues
   and cells. The results from GSE15459 showed that patients with low
   levels of GPER mRNA had a reduced overall survival (OS) (P=0.013) and
   disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.019). A negative correlation (r=-0.611)
   between GPER mRNA and DNA methylation was found using the cBioPortal and
   MethHC. Co-expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) genes
   were enriched with GPER (P<0.0001). Cox regression analysis showed that
   GPER protein expression was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.035)
   Conclusions: Downregulation of GPER predicts poor prognosis in gastric
   cancer. GPER may act as a tumor suppressor through the regulation of EMT
   in gastric cancer.

AB Background and Objective: Endometrial cancer (EC) is a common
   gynecological malignancy worldwide. Despite advances in the development
   of strategies for treating EC, prognosis of the disease remains
   unsatisfactory, especially for advanced EC. The aim of this study was to
   identify novel genes that can be used as potential biomarkers for
   identifying the prognosis of EC and to construct a novel risk
   stratification using these genes.
   Methods and Results: An mRNA sequencing dataset, corresponding survival
   data and expression profiling of an array of EC patients were obtained
   from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus, respectively.
   Common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on
   sequencing and expression as given in the profiling dataset. Pathway
   enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed using the Database for
   Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. The protein-protein
   interaction network was established using the string online database in
   order to identify hub genes. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression
   analyses were used to screen prognostic DEGs and to construct a
   prognostic signature. Survival analysis based on the prognostic
   signature was performed on TCGA EC dataset. A total of 255 common DEGs
   were found and 11 hub genes (TOP2A, CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, AURKA, PCNA,
   CCNA2, BIRC5, NDC80, CDC20, and BUB1BA) that may be closely related to
   the pathogenesis of EC were identified. A panel of 7 DEG signatures
   consisting of PHLDA2, GGH, ESPL1, FAM184A, KIAA1644, ESPL1, and TRPM4
   were constructed. The signature performed well for prognosis prediction
   (p < 0.001) and time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)
   analysis displayed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.797, 0.734, 0.729,
   and 0.647 for 1, 3, 5, and 10-year overall survival (OS) prediction,
   respectively.
   Conclusion: This study identified potential genes that may be involved
   in the pathophysiology of EC and constructed a novel gene expression
   signature for EC risk stratification and prognosis prediction.

AB Quantifying or labeling the sample type with high quality is a
   challenging task, which is a key step for understanding complex
   diseases. Reducing noise pollution to data and ensuring the extracted
   intrinsic patterns in concordance with the primary data structure are
   important in sample clustering and classification. Here we propose an
   effective data integration framework named as HCI (High-order
   Correlation Integration), which takes an advantage of high-order
   correlation matrix incorporated with pattern fusion analysis (PFA), to
   realize high-dimensional data feature extraction. On the one hand, the
   high-order Pearson's correlation coefficient can highlight the latent
   patterns underlying noisy input datasets and thus improve the accuracy
   and robustness of the algorithms currently available for sample
   clustering. On the other hand, the PFA can identify intrinsic sample
   patterns efficiently from different input matrices by optimally
   adjusting the signal effects. To validate the effectiveness of our new
   method, we firstly applied HCI on four single-cell RNA-seq datasets to
   distinguish the cell types, and we found that HCI is capable of
   identifying the prior-known cell types of single-cell samples from
   scRNA-seq data with higher accuracy and robustness than other methods
   under different conditions. Secondly, we also integrated heterogonous
   omics data from TCGA datasets and GEO datasets including bulk RNA-seq
   data, which outperformed the other methods at identifying distinct
   cancer subtypes. Within an additional case study, we also constructed
   the mRNA-miRNA regulatory network of colorectal cancer based on the
   feature weight estimated from HCI, where the differentially expressed
   mRNAs and miRNAs were significantly enriched in well-known functional
   sets of colorectal cancer, such as KEGG pathways and IPA disease
   annotations. All these results supported that HCI has extensive
   flexibility and applicability on sample clustering with different types
   and organizations of RNA-seq data.

AB Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is a common malignancy with
   high mortality and poor prognosis. Alternative splicing (AS) is a
   transcriptional regulation mechanism that generates multiple transcripts
   from same genes, and aberrant AS signatures of cancers can be predictive
   for prognosis. We identified the survival-related AS events and splicing
   factors (SFs) from the RNA sequencing data and the corresponding
   clinical information of an HNSC cohort downloaded from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) and SpliceSeq. The independent prognostic predictors were
   assessed by Cox proportional regression analysis, and the regulatory
   network of SFs and AS events was analyzed by Spearman's test and
   constructed. A total of 4626 survival-related AS events in 3280 genes
   were identified, and most were protective factors. Among the different
   types of splicing events, exon skip was the most frequent. The
   prognostic models were constructed for each type of AS, and the area
   under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of the
   combined prognostic model was 0.765, indicating good predictive
   performance. Finally, a correlation network between SF and AS events was
   constructed. We identified prognostic predictors based on AS events that
   stratified HNSC patients into the high- and low-risk groups, and
   revealed splicing networks that provide insights into the underlying
   mechanisms.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of malignant
   tumor. Many genetic factors have been proved to show high association
   with the occurrence and development of CRC andmany mutations are
   detected in CRC. PTPN4/PTP-MEG1 is a widely expressed non-receptor
   protein tyrosine phosphatase. Over the past three decades, PTPN4 has
   been demonstrated in the literature to participate in many biological
   processes. In this study, we identified a nonsense mutation of PTPN4
   with a mutation ratio of 90.90% from 1 case of rectal cancer, leading to
   loss of function in PTPN4 gene. Several somatic mutations occurred in
   5/137 rectal cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas Rectum
   Adenocarcinoma (TCGA READ) database. Interestingly, we found that PTPN4
   negative cytoplasm staining was more prone to lymphatic metastasis
   (N=50, P=0.0153) and low expression of PTPN4 in rectal cancer was highly
   associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of PTPN4 suppressed the
   cell growth, andmoreover,the loss of PTPN4 accelerated cell growth and
   boosted clonogenicity of CRC cells. Furthermore, we revealed that the
   deletion of PTPN4 promoted the tumor formation of NCM460 cells in vivo.
   In terms of the molecular mechanism, we demonstrated that PTPN4
   dephosphorylates pSTAT3 at the Tyr705 residue with a direct interaction
   and suppresses the transcriptional activity of STAT3. In summary, our
   study revealed a novel mechanism that the tumorigenesis of colorectal
   cancer might be caused by the loss of PTPN4 through activating STAT3,
   which will broaden the therapy strategy for anti-rectal cancer in the
   future.

AB Background: Bladder cancer is a multifactorial disease with increasing
   incidence and mortality. Genetic alterations and altered expressions of
   mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and miRNAs have been shown to
   play important roles in the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer. However,
   the functions of key RNAs and their regulatory network in bladder cancer
   are still to be elucidated.
   Material/Methods: RNA profiles were downloaded from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) database. The differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs, and
   miRNAs in bladder cancer were acquired through analyses of data from 414
   bladder cancer tissues and 19 normal bladder tissues. Gene Ontology and
   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis was performed by using
   "DAVID6.8" and the R package "ClusterProfile". Protein-protein
   interaction and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were
   constructed by using "STRING" database and Cytoscape 3.6.2. Based on the
   clinical data and Cox regression, a prognosis model was established, and
   survival analysis was performed.
   Results: A total of 1819 mRNAs, 659 lncRNAs, and 160 miRNAs were
   identified as significantly differentially expressed in bladder cancer
   of which 52 mRNAs, 58 lncRNAs, and 22 miRNAs were incorporated in the
   ceRNA network. CFL2 and TPM2 were found to be downregulated and showed
   significant correlation to each other in bladder cancer. HOXB5 and 6
   lncRNAs (ADAMTS9-AS1, AC112721.1, LINC00460, AC110491.1, LINC00163, and
   HCG22) were strongly associated with high-grade, disease stages, and
   overall survival.
   Conclusions: In this study, we have identified differentially expressed
   mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs in bladder cancer which were strongly
   associated with oncogenesis and prognosis. Further experimental studies
   are necessary to validate these results.

AB BackgroundBreast cancer angiogenesis is key for metastasis and predicts
   a poor prognosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a member of
   the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), was reported to restrain the
   progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC) through inhibiting angiogenesis. However, the
   relationship between ACE2 and breast cancer angiogenesis remains
   unclear.MethodsThe prognosis and relative gene selection were analysed
   using the GEPIA, GEO, TCGA and STRING databases. ACE2 expression in
   breast cancer tissue was estimated by reverse transcription-quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Breast cancer cell migration,
   proliferation and angiogenesis were assessed by Transwell migration,
   proliferation, tube formation, and wound healing assays. The expression
   of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFa) was detected by qPCR and
   Western blotting. The phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth
   factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2
   (MEK1/2), and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
   was examined by Western blotting. Breast cancer metastasis and
   angiogenesis in vivo were measured using a zebrafish model.ResultsACE2
   was downregulated in breast cancer patients. Patients with higher ACE2
   expression had longer relapse-free survival (RFS). In vitro, ACE2
   inhibited breast cancer migration. Meanwhile, ACE2 in breast cancer
   cells inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC)
   proliferation, tube formation and migration. In the zebrafish model,
   ACE2 inhibited breast cancer cell metastasis, as demonstrated by
   analyses of the number of disseminated foci and the metastatic distance.
   Neo-angiogenesis was also decreased by ACE2. ACE2 downregulated the
   expression of VEGFa in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, ACE2 in breast
   cancer cells inactivated the phosphorylation of VEGFR2, MEK1/2, and
   ERK1/2 in HUVECs.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that ACE2, as a
   potential resister to breast cancer, might inhibit breast cancer
   angiogenesis through the VEGFa/VEGFR2/ERK pathway.Trial

AB Due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of cancer, it is still a
   challenge to predict the prognosis of cancer patients. In this work, we
   used a clustering algorithm to divide patients into different subtypes
   in order to reduce the heterogeneity of the cancer patients in each
   subtype. Based on the hypothesis that the gene co-expression network may
   reveal relationships among genes, some communities in the network could
   influence the prognosis of cancer patients and all the prognosis-related
   communities could fully reveal the prognosis of cancer patients. To
   predict the prognosis for cancer patients in each subtype, we adopted an
   ensemble classifier based on the gene co-expression network of the
   corresponding subtype. Using the gene expression data of ovarian cancer
   patients in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), three subtypes were
   identified. Survival analysis showed that patients in different subtypes
   had different survival risks. Three ensemble classifiers were
   constructed for each subtype. Leave-one-out and independent validation
   showed that our method outperformed control and literature methods.
   Furthermore, the function annotation of the communities in each subtype
   showed that some communities were cancer-related. Finally, we found that
   the current drug targets can partially support our method.

AB Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the leading cause of
   cancer-related mortality worldwide. Molecular characterization-based
   methods hold great promise for improving the diagnostic accuracy and for
   predicting treatment response. The DNA methylation patterns of LUAD
   display a great potential as a specific biomarker that will complement
   invasive biopsy, thus improving early detection.
   Method: In this study, based on the whole-genome methylation datasets
   from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TOGA) and several machine learning
   methods, we evaluated the possibility of DNA methylation signatures for
   identifying lymph node metastasis of LUAD, differentiating between tumor
   tissue and normal tissue, and predicting the overall survival (OS) of
   LUAD patients. Using the regularized logistic regression, we built a
   classifier based on the 3616 CpG sites to identify the lymph node
   metastasis of LUAD. Furthermore, a classifier based on 14 CpG sites was
   established to differentiate between tumor and normal tissues. Using the
   Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression,
   we built a 16-CpG-based model to predict the OS of LUAD patients.
   Results: With the aid of 3616-CpG-based classifier, we were able to
   identify the lymph node metastatic status of patients directly by the
   methylation signature from the primary tumor tissues. The 14-CpG-based
   classifier could differentiate between tumor and normal tissues. The
   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for
   both classifiers achieved values close to 1, demonstrating the robust
   classifier effect. The 16-CpG-based model showed independent prognostic
   value in LUAD patients.
   Interpretation: These findings will not only facilitate future treatment
   decisions based on the DNA methylation signatures but also enable
   additional investigations into the utilization of LUAD DNA methylation
   pattern by different machine learning methods.

AB DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) decitabine and azacytidine are
   approved therapies for myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid
   leukemia, and their combinations with other anticancer agents are being
   tested as therapeutic options for multiple solid cancers such as colon,
   ovarian, and lung cancer. However, the current therapeutic challenges of
   DNMTis include development of resistance, severe side effects and no or
   partial treatment responses, as observed in more than half of the
   patients. Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand the
   mechanisms of action of these drugs. In order to discover molecular
   targets of DNMTi therapy, we identified 638 novel CpGs with an increased
   methylation in response to decitabine treatment in HCT116 cell lines and
   validated the findings in multiple cancer types (e.g., bladder, ovarian,
   breast, and lymphoma) cell lines, bone marrow mononuclear cells from
   primary leukemia patients, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   and ascites from platinum resistance epithelial ovarian cancer patients.
   Azacytidine treatment also increased methylation of these CpGs in colon,
   ovarian, breast, and lymphoma cancer cell lines. Methylation at 166
   identified CpGs strongly correlated (vertical bar r vertical bar >=
   0.80) with corresponding gene expression in HCT116 cell line.
   Differences in methylation at some of the identified CpGs and expression
   changes of the corresponding genes was observed in TCGA colon cancer
   tissue as compared to adjacent healthy tissue. Our analysis revealed
   that hypermethylated CpGs are involved in cancer cell proliferation and
   apoptosis by P53 and olfactory receptor pathways, hence influencing
   DNMTi responses. In conclusion, we showed hypermethylation of CpGs as a
   novel mechanism of action for DNMTi agents and identified 638
   hypermethylated molecular targets (CpGs) common to decitabine and
   azacytidine therapy. These novel results suggest that hypermethylation
   of CpGs should be considered when predicting the DNMTi responses and
   side effects in cancer patients.

AB PURPOSE: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classification has been
   validated for uveal melanoma (UM) prognostication. We applied TCGA
   classification to UM biopsied using fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)
   to determine the predictability for metastasis and death.
   DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
   PARTICIPANTS: Patients with UM treated with plaque radiotherapy at Wills
   Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from October 1, 2008, through
   December 31, 2018, who completed genetic analysis of chromosomes 3 and 8
   after FNAB.
   METHODS: Tumors were classified as A, B, C, or D and were compared using
   the chi-square test, Fisher exact test, analysis of variance, and
   Kaplan-Meier analysis.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Metastasis and death.
   RESULTS: Six hundred fifty-eight UM patients were categorized
   accordingly as TCGA class A (n= 342 [52%]), B (n= 91 [14%]), C (n= 118
   [18%]), and D (n= 107 [16%]). More advanced tumor classification
   revealed older mean patient age (56 vs. 53 vs. 60 vs. 63 years,
   respectively; P < 0.001), worse presenting visual acuity (20/20-20/50:
   81% vs. 67% vs. 71% vs. 66%, respectively; P < 0.001), greater distance
   from the optic disc (3.5vs. 4.9 vs. 5.7 vs. 5.3 mm, respectively; P <
   0.001), larger tumor basal diameter (10.3 vs. 12.9 vs. 13.9 vs. 15.3mm,
   respectively; P < 0.001), and greater tumor thickness (4.3 vs. 6.1 vs.
   6.6 vs. 7.5 mm, respectively; P<0.001). After mean follow-up (47.6 vs.
   47.6 vs. 42.9 vs. 28.7 months, respectively; P < 0.001), more advanced
   TCGA class was associated with increased risk of metastasis (3% vs. 10%
   vs. 25% vs. 41%, respectively; P<0.001) and death (1% vs. 0% vs. 3% vs.
   9%, respectively; P < 0.001). Compared with class A, the 5-year hazard
   ratio for metastasis increased at 4.1 (B vs. A; P= 0.01), 10.1 (C vs. A;
   P < 0.001), and 30.0 (D vs. A; P< 0.001). The 5-year hazard ratio for
   death increased at 3.1 (C vs. A; P= 0.11) and 13.7 (D vs. A; P<0.001)
   with no deaths in class B.
   CONCLUSIONS: Grouping of UM using TCGA classification predicts the risk
   of melanoma-related metastasis and death.

AB Copy number alterations are crucial for the development of colorectal
   cancer (CRC). Our whole genome analysis identified tocopherol alpha
   transfer protein-like (TTPAL) as preferentially amplified in CRC. Here
   we demonstrate that frequent copy number gain of TTPAL leads to gene
   overexpression in CRC from a Chinese cohort (n=102), which was further
   validated by a TCGA cohort (n=376). High expression of TTPAL was
   significantly associated with shortened survival in CRC patients. TTPAL
   promoted cell viability and clonogenicity, accelerated cell cycle
   progression, inhibited cell apoptosis, increased cell migration/invasion
   ability in vitro, and promoted tumorigenicity and cancer metastasis in
   vivo. TTPAL significantly activated Wnt signaling and increased
   beta-catenin activation and protein expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc.
   Co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry identified thyroid
   receptor-interacting protein 6 (TRIP6) as a direct downstream effector
   of TTPAL. Depletion of TRIP6 significantly abolished the effects of
   TTPAL on cell proliferation and Wnt activation. Direct binding of TTPAL
   with TRIP6 in the cytoplasm inhibited ubiquitin-mediated degradation of
   TRIP6; subsequently increased levels of TRIP6 displaced beta-catenin
   from the tumor suppressor MAGI1 via competitive binding. This sequence
   of events allows beta-catenin to enter the nucleus and promote oncogenic
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In conclusion, TTPAL is commonly
   overexpressed in CRC due to copy number gain, which promotes colorectal
   tumorigenesis by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via stabilization
   of TRIP6. TTPAL overexpression may serve as an independent new biomarker
   for the prognosis of CRC patients.

AB We previously reported that ionizing radiation (IR) mediates cell death
   through the induction of CUGBP elav-like family member 2 (CELF2), a
   tumor suppressor. CELF2 is an RNA binding protein that modulates mRNA
   stability and translation. Since IR induces autophagy, we hypothesized
   that CELF2 regulates autophagy-mediated colorectal cancer (CRC) cell
   death. For clinical relevance, we determined CELF2 levels in The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA). Role of CELF2 in radiation response was carried out
   in CRC cell lines by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, autophagic
   vacuole analyses, RNA stability assay, quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction and electron microscopy. In vivo studies were performed in a
   xenograft tumor model. TCGA analyses demonstrated that compared to
   normal tissue, CELF2 is expressed at significantly lower levels in CRC,
   and is associated with better overall 5-year survival in patients
   receiving radiation. Mechanistically, CELF2 increased levels of critical
   components of the autophagy cascade including Beclin-1, ATG5, and ATG12
   by modulating mRNA stability. CELF2 also increased autophagic flux in
   CRC. IR significantly induced autophagy in CRC which correlates with
   increased levels of CELF2 and autophagy associated proteins. Silencing
   CELF2 with siRNA, mitigated IR induced autophagy. Moreover, knockdown of
   CELF2 in vivo conferred tumor resistance to IR. These studies elucidate
   an unrecognized role for CELF2 in inducing autophagy and potentiating
   the effects of radiotherapy in CRC.

AB For women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the

   long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been discovered to be related to
   tumorigenesis, progression, and prognosis. FOXD3-AS1 is a lncRNA and has
   been identified as a cancer-promoting gene in glioma. By analysing the
   FOXD3-AS1 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we
   found that FOXD3-AS1 has significantly high expression in breast cancer
   tumour comparing with the normal tissue. And patients with low FOXD3-AS1
   expression had greater survival probability, smaller tumour size, and
   less distant metastasis. This leads us to peep inquisitively biological
   function of FOXD3-AS1 in breast cancer. Biological assays demonstrated
   that silenced FOXD3-AS1 impaired cell proliferation and inhibited cell
   migration and invasion in breast cancer cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-231).
   These results suggest that FOXD3-AS1 could play a potential diagnostics
   or prognostic biomarker for patients with breast cancer. We demonstrated
   that lncRNA FOXD3-AS1 has significantly high expression in breast cancer
   cell lines comparing with the normal tissue. Besides, our findings
   suggested that lncRNA FOXD3-AS1 could play a potential diagnostics or

AB BackgroundCompelling lines of evidence indicate that DNA methylation of
   non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) plays critical roles in various tumour
   progression. In addition, the differential methylation of ncRNAs can
   predict prognosis of patients. However, little is known about the clear
   relationship between DNA methylation profile of ncRNAs and the prognosis
   of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) patients.MethodsThe data of DNA
   methylation, RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical features of PAC patients
   were collected from TCGA database. The DNA methylation profile was
   obtained using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. LASSO
   regression was performed to construct two methylation-based classifiers.
   The risk score of methylation-based classifiers was calculated for each
   patient, and the accuracy of the classifiers in predicting overall
   survival (OS) was examined by ROC curve analysis. In addition, Cox
   regression models were utilized to assess whether clinical variables and
   the classifiers were independent prognostic factors for OS. The targets
   of miRNA and the genes co-expressed with lncRNA were identified with
   DIANA microT-CDS and the Multi-Experiment Matrix (MEM), respectively.
   Moreover, DAVID Bioinformatics Resources were applied to analyse the
   functional enrichment of these targets and co-expressed genes.ResultsA
   total of 4004 CpG sites of miRNA and 11,259 CpG sites of lncRNA were
   screened. Among these CpG sites, 8 CpG sites of miRNA and 7 CpG sites of
   lncRNA were found with regression coefficients. By multiplying the sum
   of methylation degrees of the selected CpGs with these coefficients, two
   methylation-based classifiers were constructed. The classifiers have
   shown good performance in predicting the survival rate of PAC patients
   at varying follow-up times. Interestingly, both of these two classifiers
   were predominant and independent factors for OS. Furthermore, functional
   enrichment analysis demonstrated that aberrantly methylated miRNAs and
   lncRNAs are related to calcium ion transmembrane transport and MAPK, Ras
   and calcium signalling pathways.ConclusionIn the present study, we
   identified two methylation-based classifiers of ncRNA associated with OS
   in PAC patients through a comprehensive analysis of miRNA and lncRNA
   profiles. We are the first group to demonstrate a relationship between
   the aberrant DNA methylation of ncRNAs and the prognosis of PAC, and
   this relationship would contribute to individualized PAC therapy.

   However, the mechanism of action of ceRNA in LUAD remains elusive. In
   the present study, differentially expressed mRNAs, microRNAs (miRs) and
   long non-coding RNAs from the cancer genome atlas database were

   software. Among the ceRNAs identified, family with sequence similarity
   83 member A (FAM83A), miR-34c-5p, KCNQ1OT1 and FLJ26245 were observed to
   be significantly associated with the overall survival of patients with

AB BackgroundMost methods that integrate network and mutation data to study
   cancer focus on the effects of genes/proteins, quantifying the effect of
   mutations or differential expression of a gene and its neighbors, or
   identifying groups of genes that are significantly up- or
   down-regulated. However, several mutations are known to disrupt specific
   protein-protein interactions, and network dynamics are often ignored by
   such methods. Here we introduce a method that allows for predicting the
   disruption of specific interactions in cancer patients using somatic
   mutation data and protein interaction networks.MethodsWe extend standard
   network smoothing techniques to assign scores to the edges in a protein
   interaction network in addition to nodes. We use somatic mutations as
   input to our modified network smoothing method, producing scores that
   quantify the proximity of each edge to somatic mutations in individual
   samples.ResultsUsing breast cancer mutation data, we show that predicted
   edges are significantly associated with patient survival and known
   ligand binding site mutations. In-silico analysis of protein binding
   further supports the ability of the method to infer novel disrupted
   interactions and provides a mechanistic explanation for the impact of
   mutations on key pathways.ConclusionsOur results show the utility of our
   method both in identifying disruptions of protein interactions from
   known ligand binding site mutations, and in selecting novel clinically
   significant interactions.Supporting website with software and data:

AB Background: Thyroid cancer is a type of endocrine cancers with rapidly
   increased incidence. Recent studies have indicated long non-coding RNAs
   (IncRNAs) played crucial roles in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis and
   progression. However, the roles of most IncRNAs in thyroid cancer were
   still unclear.
   Material/Methods: We used TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), GSE50901,
   GSE29265, and GSE33630 datasets to analyze the ex- pression pattern of
   ZFAS1 (ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1). The correlation between ZFAS1 and
   clinicopathological features in thyroid cancer was analyzed. Cell
   proliferation and cell cycle assays were used to validate the roles of
   ZFAS1 in thyroid cancer cell lines. DAVID (the database for annotation,
   visualization and integrated discover) system was used to perform GO
   (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
   pathway analysis. The starBase datasets and Cytoscape was used to
   perform ceRNA (competitive endogenous RNA) network.
   Results: We demonstrated ZFAS1 was highly expressed in thyroid cancer
   compared to normal samples. Moreover, upregulation of ZFAS1 was
   positively correlated with clinicopathological features and poor
   prognosis in thyroid cancer. Functional validation showed knockdown of
   ZFAS1 suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle in thyroid cancer
   cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed ZFAS1 was associated with
   translation, rRNA processing, intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport,
   ribosome, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.
   Conclusions: Our study suggested ZFAS1 could serve as a biomarker for
   thyroid cancer.

AB Ovarian cancer is one of the most common female reproductive system
   malignancies worldwide. Recently, the aberrant long noncoding RNAs
   (lncRNAs) expression has been identified in multiple cancers. Emerging
   evidence has highlighted the critical roles of lncRNAs in carcinogenesis
   and tumor progression, including ovarian cancer. The objective of this
   study is to comprehensively analyze lncRNAs expression pattern, and
   explore their clinical significance and underlying mechanism in human
   ovarian cancer. In this study, we found hundreds of dysregulated lncRNAs
   in ovarian cancer by performing genome-wide analysis using RNA
   sequencing data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and three microarray datasets from Gene
   Expression Omnibus (GEO). Moreover, our results revealed that up- or
   down-regulation of some lncRNAs expression in ovarian cancer is
   accompanied by their genomic loci copy number amplification or deletion.
   Importantly, some lncRNAs expression levels are significantly associated
   with ovarian cancer patients' poor prognosis. Further experimental
   validation and mechanistic investigation indicate that LINC00511 exerts
   oncogenic function in ovarian cancer cells through interacting with EZH2
   and repressing P21 expression. Taken together, the findings in the
   current study may provide a useful resource of novel ovarian cancer
   associated lncRNAs and potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic
   targets for ovarian cancer.

AB In addition to being refractory to treatment, melanoma cancer stem cells
   (CSC) are known to suppress host anti-tumor immunity, the underlying
   mechanisms of which need further elucidation. In this study, we
   established a novel role for microRNA-92 (miR-92) and its associated
   gene networks in immunosuppression. CSCs were isolated from the B16-F10
   murine melanoma cell line based on expression of the putative CSC marker
   CD133 (Prominin-1). CD133+ cells were functionally distinct from CD133-
   cells and showed increased proliferation in vitro and enhanced
   tumorigenesis in vivo. CD133+ CSCs also exhibited a greater capacity to
   recruit immunosuppressive cell types during tumor formation, including
   FoxP3+ Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and M2
   macrophages. Using microarray technology, we identified several miRs
   that were significantly downregulated in CD133+ cells compared to CD133-
   cells, including miR-92. Decreased expression of miR-92 in CSCs led to
   higher expression of target molecules integrin alphaV and alpha5
   subunits, which in turn enhanced TGF-beta activation as evidenced by
   increased phosphorylation of SMAD2. CD133+ cells transfected with
   miR-92a mimic and injected in vivo showed significantly decreased tumor
   burden, which was associated with reduced immunosuppressive phenotype
   intratumorally. Using the TCGA database of melanoma patients, we also
   noted a positive correlation between integrin alpha5 and TGF-beta1
   expression levels and an inverse association between miR-92 expression
   and integrin alpha subunit expression. Collectively, the current study
   suggests that a miR-92-driven signaling axis involving integrin
   activation of TGF-beta in CSCs promotes enhanced tumorigenesis through
   induction of intratumoral immunosuppression.

AB AIMS: DNA methylation has been found to regulate microRNAs (miRNAs)
   expression, but the prognostic value of miRNA-related DNA methylation
   aberration remained largely elusive in cancers including glioblastomas
   (GBMs). This study aimed to investigate the clinical and biological
   feature of miRNA methylation in GBMs of non-glioma-CpG island methylator
   phenotype (non-G-CIMP).
   METHODS: Prognostic miRNA methylation loci were analyzed, with TCGA and
   Rennes cohort as training sets, and independent datasets of GBMs and
   low-grade gliomas (LGGs) were obtained as validation sets. Different
   statistical and bioinformatic analysis and experimental validations were
   performed to clinically and biologically characterize the signature.
   RESULTS: We identified and validated a risk score based on methylation
   status of five miRNA-associated CpGs which could predict survival of GBM
   patients in a series of training and validation sets. This signature was
   independent of age and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
   promoter methylation status. The risk subgroup was associated with
   angiogenesis and accordingly differential responses to
   bevacizumab-contained therapy. MiRNA target analysis and in vitro
   experiments further confirmed the accuracy of this signature.
   CONCLUSION: The five-CpG signature of miRNA methylation was biologically
   relevant and was of potential prognostic and predictive value for GBMs.
   It might be of help for improving individualized treatment.

TI Bioinformatics profiling utilized a nine immune-related long noncoding
   RNA signature as a prognostic target for pancreatic cancer.

AB PURPOSE: To identify an immune-related long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)
   signature with potential prognostic value for patients with pancreatic
   cancer.
   METHODS: Pancreatic cancer samples with available clinical information
   and whole genomic mRNA expression data obtained from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) were enrolled in our research. The immune score of each
   sample was calculated according to the expression level of
   immune-related genes and used to identify the most promising
   immune-related lncRNAs. According to the risk score developed from
   screened immune-related lncRNAs, the high- and low-risk groups were
   separated on the basis of the median risk score. The prediction
   reliability was further evaluated in the validation set and combination
   set. Both gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and principal component
   analysis (PCA) were performed for functional annotation, and the
   microenvironment cell population record was applied to evaluate the
   immune composition and purity of the tumor.
   RESULTS: A cohort of 176 samples was included in this study. A total of
   163 immune-related lncRNAs were collected according to Pearson
   correlation analyses between immune score and lncRNA expression |R|>0.5,
   P<0.01). Nine immune-related lncRNAs (AL138966.2, AL133520.1,
   AC142472.1, AC127024.5, AC116913.1, AC083880.1, AC124016.1, AC008443.5,
   and AC092171.5) with the most significant prognostic values (P<0.01)
   were identified. In the training set, it was observed that patients in
   the low-risk group showed longer overall survival (OS) than those in the
   high-risk group (P<0.001); meanwhile, similar results were found in the
   validation set, combination set and various stratified sets (P<0.05,
   P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Moreover, the signature was identified
   as an independent prognostic factor and significantly associated with
   the OS of pancreatic cancer. The area under curve (AUC) of the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) for the nine lncRNA signature
   in predicting the 2-year survival rate was 0.703. In addition, the
   low-risk and high-risk groups displayed different distributed patterns
   in PCA and different immune statuses in the GSEA. The signature
   indicated decreased purity of the tumor by implying a lower proportion
   of cancer cells along with an increasing enrichment of fibroblasts,
   myeloid dendritic cells, and monocytic lineage cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that the immune-related lncRNA
   signature possesses latent prognostic value for patients with pancreatic
   cancer and may provide new information for immunological research and
   treatment in pancreatic cancer.

AB miRNAs may play effective roles in breast cancer so modulating their
   expression levels could have therapeutic benefits. Recent studies have
   found the combination of miRNA-based therapeutics with conventional
   drugs as promising. This study aimed to find drug-responsive miRNAs, and
   explore their anticancer activities in HER2+ breast cancer cells and
   regulatory role in the trastuzumab response. qRT-PCR-array analysis was
   performed with effective concentrations of tamoxifen and trastuzumab
   treated BT-474, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells. Motility and invasion analyses
   were performed with wound healing and xCEL-Ligence impedance-based
   assays respectively. Viability of cells following mimic transfection and
   drug treatment was assessed by WST-1 assay. Western blot analysis was
   used to assess miR-770-5p regulation of proteins and their
   phosphorylated forms. The clinical relevance of miR-770-5p was examined
   by TCGA data analysis. The qRT-PCR-array results indicated that
   miR-770-5p was responsive in a drug and cell line independent manner.
   Overexpression of miR-770-5p inhibited the motility and cell invasion
   through regulation of AKT and ERK proteins. Additionally, miR-770-5p
   potentiated the effectiveness of trastuzumab. Thus, regulating the
   expression level of miR-770-5p in combination with trastuzumab treatment
   may simultaneously inhibit the downstream elements of PI3K and MAPK
   signalling, thereby blocking the proliferation, motility and invasion
   capacities of HER2+ breast cancer cells.

AB Background: Cervical cancer (CC) is a common gynecological malignancy in
   women worldwide. Evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
   can be used as biomarkers in patients with CC. However, prognostic
   biomarkers for CC are still lacking. The aim of our study was to find
   lncRNA biomarkers which are able to predict prognosis in CC based on the
   data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
   Methods: The patients were divided into three groups according to FIGO
   stage. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in CC tissue
   compared to adjacent normal tissues based on a fold change >2 and <0.5
   at P < 0.05 for up- and downregulated lncRNA, respectively. The
   relationship between survival outcome and lncRNA expression was assessed
   with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
   analysis. We constructed a risk score as a method to evaluate prognosis.
   We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under
   curve (AUC) analyses to assess the diagnostic value of a two-lncRNA
   signature. We detected the expression levels of the two lncRNAs in 31
   pairs of newly diagnosed CC specimens and paired adjacent non-cancerous
   tissue specimens, and also in CC cell lines. Finally, the results were
   statistically compared using t-tests.
   Results: In total, 289 RNA sequencing profiles and accompanying clinical
   data were obtained. We identified 49 differentially expressed lncRNAs,
   of which two related to overall survival (OS) in CC patients. These two
   lncRNAs (ILF3-AS1 and RASA4CP) were found together as a single
   prognostic signature. Meanwhile, the prognosis of patients with low-risk
   CC was better and positively correlated with OS (P < 0.001). Further
   analysis showed that the combined two-lncRNA expression signature could
   be used as an independent biomarker to evaluate the prognosis in CC.
   qRT-PCR results were consistent with TCGA, confirming downregulated
   expression of both lncRNAs. Furthermore, upon ROC curve analysis, the
   AUC of the combined lncRNAs was greater than that of the single lncRNAs
   alone (0.723 vs 0.704 and 0.685), respectively; P < 0.05.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that the two-lncRNA signature of ILF3-AS1
   and RASA4CP can be used as an independent biomarker for the prognosis of
   CC, based on bioinformatic analysis.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the genomic
   alterations of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in Chinese patients and to
   evaluate the correlations between significantly mutated genes and tumor
   mutation burden (TMB) levels in RCC.
   Material/Methods: Two batch of specimens were collected from patients
   with RCC. Cohort 1 enrolled 17 RCC patients. Specimens and
   clinicopathological data were collected and the duration of disease-free
   survival were evaluated with a follow-up from 2 weeks to longer than 1
   year. Cohort 2 collected 70 clear cell RCC (ccRCC) tissues and blood
   specimens. Next-generation sequencing were used to detect the genomic
   variations in those specimens in both cohorts and TMB in cohort 2.
   Clinicopathological features of the 2 cohorts were collected and the
   chi(2) test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables
   stratified by TMB values.
   Results: Our present study demonstrated that the top 3 most frequent
   aberrated genes in Chinese ccRCC patients were ABCB1, UGT1A1, and VHL,
   with percentages of 50.00%, 42.86%, and 34.52% respectively. And only 1
   gene, which was ABCB1, showed statistically significant difference
   (P=0.047) stratified by TMB levels. In addition, 6 oncogenic pathways
   were involved in ccRCC cases in the 2 cohorts. Only 5 out of the 8 most
   common altered genes of RCC from COSMIC or TCGA databases were detected
   in our study.
   Conclusions: The genomic alterations of Chinese RCC patients were
   different from that in TCGA and COSMIC. No significant genomic
   alterations were found correlating to TMB levels in ccRCC. Non-silent
   mutation of VHL may be a predictor for the outcome of ccRCC treated with
   axitinib.

TI The Role Played by SLUG, an Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Factor, in

AB In malignant gliomas, invasive phenotype and cancer stemness promoting
   resurgence of residual tumor cells render treatment very difficult.
   Hence, identification of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors
   associated with invasion and stemness of glioma cells is critical. To
   address the issue, we investigated several EMT factors in hypermotile
   U87MG and U251 cells, orthotopic mouse glioma model, and human glioma
   samples. Of several EMT markers, SLUG expression was notably increased
   at the invasive fronts of gliomas, both in mouse tumor grafts and human
   glioma samples. The biological role played by SLUG was investigated
   using a colony-forming assay after chemotherapy and irradiation, and by
   employing a neurosphere culture assay. The effect of SLUG on glioma
   progression was examined in our patient cohort and samples, and compared
   to large public data from the REMBRANDT and TCGA. Genetic upregulation
   of SLUG was associated with increased levels of stemness factors and
   enhanced resistance to radiation and temozolomide. In our cohort,
   patients exhibiting lower-level SLUG expression evidenced longer
   progression-free survival (P=0.042). Also, in the REMBRANDT dataset, a
   group in which SLUG was downregulated exhibited a significant survival
   benefit (P<0.001). Although paired glioblastoma samples from our
   patients did not show a significant increase of SLUG expression,
   increased mRNA levels of SLUG were found in recurrent glioblastoma from
   TCGA (P=0.052), and in temozolomide-treated glioma cells and mouse tumor
   grafts. SLUG may contribute to glioma progression by controlling
   invasion at infiltrating margins, associated with increased stemness and
   therapeutic resistance.

TI Novel RB1-Loss Transcriptomic Signature Is Associated with Poor Clinical

AB Purpose: Rb-pathway disruption is of great clinical interest, as it has
   been shown to predict outcomes in multiple cancers. We sought to develop
   a transcriptomic signature for detecting biallelic RB1 loss (RBS) that
   could be used to assess the clinical implications of RB1 loss on a
   pan-cancer scale.Experimental Design: We utilized data from the Cancer
   Cell Line Encyclopedia (N = 995) to develop the first pan-cancer
   transcriptomic signature for predicting biallelic RB1 loss (RBS). Model
   accuracy was validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer
   dataset (N = 11,007). RBS was then used to assess the clinical relevance
   of biallelic RB1 loss in TCGA Pan-Cancer and in an additional metastatic
   castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cohort.Results: RBS
   outperformed the leading existing signature for detecting RB1 biallelic
   loss across all cancer types in TCGA Pan-Cancer (AUC, 0.89 vs. 0.66).
   High RBS (RB1 biallelic loss) was associated with promoter
   hypermethylation (P = 0.008) and gene body hypomethylation (P = 0.002),
   suggesting RBS could detect epigenetic gene silencing. TCGA Pan-Cancer
   clinical analyses revealed that high RBS was associated with short
   progression-free (P < 0.00001), overall (P = 0.0004), and
   disease-specific (P < 0.00001) survival. On multivariable analyses, high
   RBS was predictive of shorter progression-free survival in TCGA
   Pan-Cancer (P = 0.03) and of shorter overall survival in mCRPC (P =
   0.004) independently of the number of DNA alterations in RB1
   Conclusions: Our study provides the first validated tool to assess RB1
   biallelic loss across cancer types based on gene expression. RBS can be
   useful for analyzing datasets with or without DNA-sequencing results to
   investigate the emerging prognostic and treatment implications of
   Rb-pathway disruption.

AB Recent advancement in understanding cancer etiology has highlighted
   epigenetic deregulation as an important phenomenon leading to poor
   prognosis in glioblastoma (GBM). Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is
   one such important epigenetic modifier reportedly altered in GBM.
   However, its defined mechanism in tumorigenesis still remains elusive.
   In present study, we analyzed our in-house ChIPseq data for H3k27me3
   modified miRNAs and identified miR-490-3p to be the most common target
   in GBM with significantly downregulated expression in glioma patients in
   both TCGA and GBM patient cohort. Our functional analysis delineates for
   the first time, a central role of PRC2 catalytic unit EZH2 in directly
   regulating expression of this miRNA and its host gene CHRM2 in GBM. In
   accordance, cell line treatment with EZH2 siRNA and 5-azacytidine also
   confirmed its coregulation by CpG and histone methylation based
   epigenetic mechanisms. Furthermore, induced overexpression of miR-490-3p
   in GBM cell lines significantly inhibited key hallmarks including
   cellular proliferation, colony formation and spheroid formation, as well
   as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with downregulation of
   multiple EMT transcription factors and promigratory genes (MMP9, CCL5,
   PIK3R1, ICAM1, ADAM17 and NOTCH1). We also for the first time report
   TGFBR1 and TGIF2 as two direct downstream effector targets of miR-490-3p
   that are also deregulated in GBM. TGIF2, a novel target, was shown to
   promote migration and EMT that could partially be rescued by miR-490-3p
   overexpression. Overall, this stands as a first study that provides a
   direct link between epigenetic modulator EZH2 and oncogenic TGF-beta
   signaling involving novel miR-490-3p/TGIF2/TGFBR1 axis, that being
   targetable might be promising in developing new therapeutic intervention
   strategies for GBM.

AB BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a
   heterogeneous disease with high mortality. The identification of
   specific HNSCC biomarkers will increase treatment efficacy and limit the
   toxicity of current therapeutic strategies. Long non-coding RNAs
   (lncRNAs) are promising biomarkers. Accordingly, here we investigate the
   biological role of ZFAS1 and its potential as a biomarker in HNSCC.
   METHODS: The expression level of ZFAS1 in HNSCC cell lines was analyzed
   using qRT-PCR. Based on the HNSCC TCGA data, the ZFAS1 expression
   profile, clinicopathological features, and expression of correlated
   genes were analyzed in patient tissue samples. The selected genes were
   classified according to their biological function using the PANTHER
   tool. The interaction between lncRNA:miRNA and miRNA:mRNA was tested
   using available online tools. All statistical analyses were accomplished
   using GraphPad Prism 5.
   RESULTS: The expression of ZFAS1 was up-regulated in the metastatic FaDu
   cell line relative to the less aggressive SCC-25 and SCC-040 and
   dysplastic DOK cell lines. The TCGA data indicated an up-regulation of
   ZFAS1 in HNSCCs compared to normal tissue samples. The ZFAS1 levels
   typically differed depending on the cancer stage and T-stage. Patients
   with a lower expression of ZFAS1 presented a slightly longer
   disease-free survival and overall survival. The analysis of genes
   associated with ZFAS1, as well its targets, indicate that they are
   linked with crucial cellular processes. In the group of patients with
   low expression of ZFAS1, we detected the up-regulation of suppressors
   and down-regulation of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT) process, metastases, and cancer-initiating cells.
   Moreover, the negative correlation between ZFAS1 and its host gene,
   ZNFX1, was observed. The analysis of interactions indicated that ZFAS1
   has a binding sequence for miR-150-5p. The expression of ZFAS1 and
   miR-150-5p is negatively correlated in HNSCC patients. miR-150-5p can
   regulate the 3'UTR of EIF4E mRNA. In the group of patients with high
   expression of ZFAS1 and low expression of miR-150-5p, we detected an
   up-regulation of EIF4E.
   CONCLUSIONS: In HNSCC, ZFAS1 displays oncogenic properties, regulates
   important processes associated with EMT, cancer-initiating cells, and
   metastases, and might affect patients' clinical outcomes. ZFAS1 likely
   regulates the cell phenotype through miR-150-5p and its downstream
   targets. Following further validation, ZFAS1 might prove a new and
   valuable biomarker.

AB Worldwide, metastatic melanoma of the skin has an aggressive course with
   high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, an increased understanding of
   the pathogenesis of metastatic melanoma has gained increasing attention,
   including the role of epigenetic modification and competing endogenous
   RNA (ceRNA). This study aimed to used bioinformatics data to undertake
   an integrative analysis of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA)
   and mRNA expression to construct a ceRNA network in metastatic melanoma.
   Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Gene Ontology (GO)
   database, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
   were analyzed. There were 471 cases that included 103 primary solid
   tumors and 368 cases of metastatic melanoma that included transcriptome
   sequencing data (including lncRNA and mRNA); 452 cases had miRNA
   sequencing data.
   Analysis of chip data identified 85 6 mRNAs, 67 miRNAs, and 250 lncRNAs
   that were differentially expressed in cases of metastatic melanoma, of
   which 25 miRNAs, 18 lncRNAs, and 18 mRNAs participated in the formation
   of ceRNAs. Survival analysis identified seven differentially expressed
   mRNAs, five differentially expressed miRNAs (miRNA-29c, miRNA-100,
   miR-142-3p, miR-150, miR-516a-2), and six differentially expressed
   lncRNAs (AC068594.1, C7orf71, FAM41C, GPC5-AS1, MUC19, LINC00402) that
   were correlated with survival time in patients with metastatic melanoma.
   Bioinformatics data and integrative analysis identified lncRNA, miRNA,
   and mRNA expression to construct a ceRNA and patient survival network in
   metastatic melanoma. These findings support the need for further studies
   on the mechanisms involved in the regulation of metastatic melanoma by
   ceRNAs.

AB Ajuba dysregulation has been reported in several human cancers. However,
   its expression patterns and biological roles in human gastric cancers
   have not yet been characterized. In the current study, we found that
   Ajuba protein was increased in gastric cancer tissues and in cell lines.
   High Ajuba expression positively correlated with the
   tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis and poor
   prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine microarray data
   mining also suggested that Ajuba mRNA upregulation in gastric cancer
   tissues. We used SGC-7901 and NCI-N87 cell lines for Ajuba
   overexpression and siRNA knockdown respectively. MTT and colony
   formation assays indicated that Ajuba overexpression increased
   proliferation rate and colony formation ability while Ajuba siRNA
   inhibited proliferation rate and colony formation ability. AnnexinV and
   JC1 staining showed that Ajuba downregulated cisplatin induced apoptosis
   while it upregulated mitochondrial membrane potential. Ajuba
   overexpression also inhibited caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, while Ajuba
   depletion showed the opposite effects. Notably, Ajuba enhanced glucose
   metabolism by upregulating glucose uptake, glucose consumption, lactate
   production and ATP production. We further revealed that Ajuba positively
   regulated cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1 at both mRNA and protein levels.
   Analysis of TCGA dataset revealed that there were positive correlations
   between Ajuba and cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, GLUT1 at the mRNA levels. Further
   investigation demonstrated that Ajuba overexpression inhibited Hippo
   signaling by upregulating YAP protein expression. Depletion of YAP by
   siRNA abolished the effect of Ajuba on cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1.
   Together, our study showed that Ajuba was overexpressed in human gastric
   cancers, where it increased cell growth and chemoresistance. Our data
   also identified novel roles of Ajuba in gastric cancer progression
   involving regulating glucose uptake and mitochondrial function through
   the YAP-GLUT1/Bcl-xL axis, making it a potential therapeutic target.

AB The expression and function of CD163 in glioma are not fully understood.
   In this report, we collected totally 1323 glioma samples from the
   Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) dataset, including 325 RNA-seq data
   and 301 mRNA microarray data, and 697 glioma samples from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset to characterize the molecular and clinical
   features of CD163 in glioma by conducting a large-scale study. We found
   that CD163 expression was positively associated with the grade of
   malignancy of glioma. CD163 expression was up-regulated in IDH wild-type
   glioma and mesenchymal subtype. Gene ontology analysis suggested that
   CD163-related genes were more involved in immune response and
   angiogenesis in glioma. Moreover, CD163 showed a positive relationship
   with stromal and immune cell populations. Kaplan-Meier curves analysis
   revealed that higher CD163 expression indicated significantly poor
   survival in glioma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Pearson
   correlation analysis revealed that CD163 was robustly associated with
   the immune checkpoints and other macrophage markers. These results
   demonstrated that CD163 predicts poor prognosis in glioma patients.
   Additionally, combination of CD163 and immune checkpoints may impair
   angiogenesis and reverse dysfunctional phenotypes of T cells, which
   suggest that CD163 may be a promising biomarker and target for
   immunotherapeutic strategies.

AB Dysregulated intratumoral immune reactions are shaped by complex
   networks of cytokines, which coordinate with tumor cells to determine
   tumor progression and aggressiveness. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the
   role of intratumoral cytokine gene expression for stratifying prognosis
   has not been systematically investigated. Using high-dimensional
   datasets of cancer specimens from clinical patients in The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA), we explored the transcript abundance and prognostic impact
   of 27 clinically evaluable cytokines in 500 LUAD tumor samples according
   to clinicopathological features and two common driver mutations (EGFR
   and KRAS). We found that reduced expression of IL12B presented as the
   single prognostic factor for both poor overall survival (OS) and
   recurrence free survival (RFS) with high hazard ratios. Moreover, we
   identified that elevated expression of IL6, CXCL8 and CSF3 were
   additional independent predictors of poor RFS in LUAD patients. Their
   prognostic significance was further strengthened by their ability to
   stratify within clinicopathological factors. Notably, we prioritized
   high risk cytokines for patients with or without mutations in EGFR and
   KRAS. Our results provide integrative associations of cytokine gene
   expression with patient survival and tumor recurrence and demonstrate
   the necessity and validity of relating clinicopathological and genetic
   disposition factors for precise and personalized disease prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the correlation of BRCA2
   gene mutation and prognosis as well as variant genes in patients with
   invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. It predicted and explored
   the possible mechanism and clinical value of BRCA2 in the occurrence and
   development of tumors.
   METHODS: Data sets of patients with bladder cancer were collected from
   the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Also the gene expression
   profile data and clinical information of the BRCA2 mutation group and
   non-BRCA2 mutation group were downloaded.
   RESULTS: The prognosis of the BRCA2 mutation group was better than that
   of the non-mutant group. Among the down-regulated genes, the following
   genes showed significant differences between the two groups: CCL22,
   CYP2B6, CYP2E1, CYP4F2, HTR1E, HTR1F, KLRC1, NAPSA, SELL, SFTPA1,
   SFTPA2, SFTPB, SFTPC and STRA8, while the following genes among the
   up-regulated genes showed significant differences between the two
   groups: ELAVL3, NOTUM, TRH and VIP. Meanwhile, the following gene sets
   were highly enriched in BRCA2: cell cycle, DNA replication, homologous
   recombination, oocyte meiosis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, base
   excision repair, progestin mediated oocyte maturation, basal
   transcription factor, biosynthesis of N polysaccharide, mismatch repair,
   sliceosome, purine metabolism as well as P53 and neurotrophic factor
   signaling pathway, etc.CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that the
   BRCA2 gene mutation is a good prognostic factor and can be used as a
   gene to predict the prognosis in the bladder cancer patients.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second frequently newly diagnosed cancer in
   men. Androgen deprivation therapy has been widely used to inhibit PCa
   growth but eventually fails in many patients. Androgen receptor and its
   downstream molecules like microRNAs could be promising therapeutic
   targets. We aimed to investigate the involvement of miR-21 in PCa
   tumorigenesis. We found that miR-21 was an unfavorable factor and
   correlated positively with tumor grade in PCa patients from TCGA
   database. MiR-21 was more highly expressed in androgen-independent PCa
   cells than in androgen-dependent PCa cells. Overexpression of miR-21
   promoted androgen-dependent and -independent PCa cell proliferation,
   migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, increased
   miR-21 expression promoted mouse xenograft growth. We identified nine
   genes differentially expressed in PCa tumors and normal tissue which
   could be potential targets of miR-21 by bioinformatic analyses. We
   demonstrate that miR-21 directly targeted KLF5 and inhibited KLF5 mRNA
   and protein levels in PCa. STRING and functional enrichment analysis
   results suggest that GSK3B might be regulated by KLF5. Our findings
   demonstrate that miR-21 promotes the tumorigenesis of PCa cells by
   directly targeting KLF5. These biological effects are mediated through
   upregulation of GSK3B and activation of the AKT signaling pathway.

AB BackgroundThe biology function of antisense intronic long noncoding RNA
   (Ai-lncRNA) is still unknown. Meanwhile, cancer patients with paclitaxel
   resistance have limited therapeutic options in the clinic. However, the
   potential involvement of Ai-lncRNA in paclitaxel sensitivity remains
   unclear in human cancer.MethodsWhole transcriptome sequencing of 33
   breast specimens was performed to identify Ai-lncRNA EGOT. Next, the
   role of EGOT in regulation of paclitaxel sensitivity was investigated.
   Moreover, the mechanism of EGOT enhancing autophagy sensitizes
   paclitaxel cytotoxicity via upregulation of ITPR1 expression by RNA-RNA
   and RNA-protein interactions was investigated in detail. Furthermore,
   upstream transcriptional regulation of EGOT expression was also
   investigated by co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin
   immunoprecipitation. Finally, clinical breast specimens in our cohort,
   TCGA and ICGC were applied to validate the role of EGOT in enhancing of
   paclitaxel sensitivity.ResultsEGOT enhances autophagosome accumulation
   via the up-regulation of ITPR1 expression, thereby sensitizing cells to
   paclitaxel toxicity. Mechanistically, on one hand, EGOT upregulates
   ITPR1 levels via formation of a pre-ITPR1/EGOT dsRNA that induces
   pre-ITPR1 accumulation to increase ITPR1 protein expression in cis. On
   the other hand, EGOT recruits hnRNPH1 to enhance the alternative
   splicing of pre-ITPR1 in trans via two binding motifs in EGOT segment 2
   (324-645 nucleotides) in exon 1. Moreover, EGOT is transcriptionally
   regulated by stress conditions. Finally, EGOT expression enhances
   paclitaxel sensitivity via assessment of cancer
   specimens.ConclusionsThese findings broaden comprehensive understanding
   of the biology function of Ai-lncRNAs. Proper regulation of EGOT may be
   a novel synergistic strategy for enhancing paclitaxel sensitivity in
   cancer therapy.

AB Tamoxifen-induced radioresistance, reported in vitro, might pose a
   problem for patients who receive neo-adjuvant tamoxifen treatment and
   subsequently receive radiotherapy after surgery. Previous studies
   suggested that DNA damage repair or cell cycle genes are involved, and
   could therefore be targeted to preclude the occurrence of
   cross-resistance. We aimed to characterize the observed cross resistance
   by investigating gene expression of DNA damage repair genes and cell
   cycle genes in estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells that
   were cultured to tamoxifen resistance. RNA sequencing was performed and
   expression of genes characteristic for several DNA damage repair
   pathways was investigated; as well as expression of genes involved in
   different phases of the cell cycle. The association of differentially
   expressed genes with outcome after radiotherapy was assessed in silico
   in a large breast cancer cohort. None of the DNA damage repair pathways
   showed differential gene expression in tamoxifen resistant cells
   compared to wild-type cells. Two DNA damage repair genes were more than
   2 times upregulated: NEIL1 and EME2; and three DNA damage repair genes
   were more than 2 times downregulated: PCNA, BRIP1, and BARD1. However,
   these were not associated with outcome after radiotherapy in the TCGA
   breast cancer cohort. Genes involved in G1, G1/S, G2, and G2/M phase
   were lower expressed in tamoxifen-resistant cells compared to wild-type
   cells. Individual genes that were more than 2 times upregulated (MAPK13)
   or downregulated (E2F2, CKS2, GINS2, PCNA, MCM5, and EIF5A2) were not
   associated with response to radiotherapy in the patient cohort
   investigated. We assessed the expression of DNA damage repair genes and
   cell cycle genes in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Though
   several genes in both pathways were differentially expressed, these
   could not explain the cross-resistance for irradiation in these cells,
   since no association to response to radiotherapy in the TCGA breast
   cancer cohort was found.

AB RATIONALE: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis occurs either associated with
   Tuberous Sclerosis Complex or as sporadic disease (S-LAM). Risk factors
   for development of S-LAM are unknown.
   OBJECTIVES: We hypothesised that DNA sequence variants outside of
   TSC2/TSC1 might be associated with susceptibility for S-LAM, and
   performed a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS).
   METHODS: Genotyped and imputed data on 5 426 936 SNPs in 426 S-LAM
   subjects were compared, using conditional logistic regression, to
   similar data from 852 females from COPDGene in a matched case-control
   design. For replication studies, genotypes for 196 non-Hispanic white
   (NHW) female S-LAM subjects were compared with three different sets of
   controls. RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry analyses were also performed.
   RESULTS: Two non-coding genotyped SNPs met genome-wide significance;
   rs4544201 and rs2006950 (p-value=4.2*10-8, 6.1*10-9, respectively) which
   are in the same 35 kb linkage disequilibrium block on chr15q26.2. This
   association was replicated in an independent cohort. NR2F2, a nuclear
   receptor and transcription factor, was the only nearby protein-coding
   gene. NR2F2 expression was higher by RNA-seq in one abdominal LAM tumour
   and four kidney angiomyolipomas, a LAM-related tumour, compared to all
   TCGA cancers. Immunohistochemistry showed strong nuclear expression in
   both LAM and angiomyolipoma tumours.
   CONCLUSIONS: SNPs on chr15q26.2 are associated with S-LAM, and chromatin
   and expression data suggest that this association may occur through
   effects on NR2F2 expression, which potentially plays an important role
   in S-LAM development.

AB Transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 3 (TMED3) is a metastatic
   suppressor in colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its
   function in the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
   is unknown. Here, we report that TMED3 could be a new prognostic marker
   for ccRCC. Patient data were extracted from cohorts in the Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC).
   Differential expression of TMED3 was observed between the low stage
   (Stage I and II) and high stage (Stage III and IV) patients in the TOGA
   and ICGC cohorts and between the low grade (Grade I and II) and high
   grade (Grade III and IV) patients in the TOGA cohort. Further, we
   evaluated TMED3 expression as a prognostic gene using Kaplan-Meier
   survival analysis, multivariate analysis, the time-dependent area under
   the curve (AUC) of Uno's C-index, and the AUC of the receiver operating
   characteristics at 5 years. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that
   TMED3 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis for ccRCC
   patients. Analysis of the C-indices and area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve further supported this. Multivariate
   analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of TMED3 expression
   levels (P = 0.005 and 0.006 for TOGA and ICGC, respectively). Taken
   together, these findings demonstrate that TMED3 is a potential
   prognostic factor for ccRCC.

AB Obesity is one of modifiable risk factors for clear cell renal cell
   cancer (ccRCC). We aim to identify the association between
   obesity-driven biomarkers and ccRCC risk. This is a retrospective,
   two-phases, case-control study involving 682 cases and 733 controls.
   Obesity-driven biomarkers (GIP, C-peptide, Insulin, Resistin, Adipsin,
   PYY, PPY, IL-6, TNF-alpha, PAI1, MCP1, Lipocalin2, Leptin, Adiponectin)
   were measured using the Milliplex method. Multivariate logistic
   regression was used to assess the associations between biomarkers and
   ccRCC risk. Results revealed GIP, C-peptide, IL6, and TNF-alpha levels
   were consistently distinct between cases and controls. These markers
   were significantly associated with ccRCC risk in both phases (except
   C-peptide). In the combined population, compared to individuals with low
   levels of the biomarkers, individuals with high level of GIP (OR=0.52,
   95% CI: 0.40-0.67) had lower risk, whereas individuals with high levels
   of C-peptide (OR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.15-1.87), IL-6 (OR=2.20, 95% CI:
   1.50-3.22), TNF-alpha (OR=1.90, 95% CI: 1.49-2.43) had significantly
   higher risk. Stratified analysis showed consistent associations with
   ccRCC risk in most subgroups (P <0.05). The risk score based on the
   IL-6, TNF-alpha and GIP was positively associated with ccRCC risk in a
   dose-response manner (P for trend=2.18E-13). Data from TCGA indicates
   that insulin signaling, IL-6 signaling and TNF-alpha signaling were
   enhanced in tumors. Collectively, our study demonstrates the integrative
   effect of insulin resistance and inflammation in ccRCC development,
   which may elucidate the basis of association between obesity and
   carcinogenesis. Further confirmation in prospective cohort studies are
   warranted for clinical applications in prevention and precision medicine
   of ccRCC.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that dysregulation of Wnt signaling
   by gene mutation and abnormal gene expression is one of the causative
   factors for gastric cancer (GC). So far, a systematic and comprehensive
   analysis of gene mutation, gene expression, and DNA methylation profiles
   of the Wnt pathway associated with gastric carcinogenesis, however, has
   not yet been reported.
   AIMS: To this end, we investigated all the above-mentioned genetic
   alterations associated with the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways
   in GC tumors, in order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying
   gastric carcinogenesis.
   METHODS: The information on gene mutations and expression was obtained
   from data resources, such as TCGA, GSEA, and TCGA-STAD, and was analyzed
   with the cBioPortal platform. We also performed in vitro analysis on
   DDK2 gene, a Wnt inhibitor, to characterize its role in GC tumor cells.
   RESULTS: We found that gene mutations of 43 Wnt genes and abnormal
   expression of 13 Wnt genes occurred at a high frequency in GC tumors,
   and gene amplification and deletion are the major mutation types.
   Clusters of DNA methylation associated with Wnt signaling genes and GC
   tumors were also revealed, and a significant increase in beta-catenin
   activity was found in the hypermethylated group of GC tumors. In
   addition, overexpression of DKK2 gene significantly inhibited multiple
   biological processes of the GC cells, including their growth, clonal
   forming, migration, and invasion ability, and induced apoptosis of the
   GC cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our current study suggested that gene mutation, abnormal
   gene expression, and altered DNA methylation profiles associated with
   the Wnt signaling may play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis,
   and DKK2 gene may act as a tumor suppressor in gastric cells.

AB The changes in cellular metabolism play an important role in promoting
   tumor progression. Recent findings suggested that the mutation of tumor
   suppressor gene p53 promoted lipids synthesis and mutant p53 (mutp53)
   was essential for regulating mevalonate pathway for cholesterol
   synthesis. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A
   (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was found to exhibit therapeutic effects
   against many types of cancers including breast cancer, colon cancer,
   lung cancer, etc. However, the underlying mechanism of the antitumor
   effect of simvastatin still needs to be further investigated. Our data
   demonstrated that suppression of mevalonate pathway by simvastatin
   significantly upregulated Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and
   p21(WAF1)(/CIP1) expression in mutant p53 colon cancer cells SW1116 but
   not in p53 wild type cells HCT116. Meanwhile, we found that
   overexpression of KLF2 could significantly induce p21(WAF1)(/CIP1)
   expression, inhibit Wnt signaling and suppress epithelialmesenchymal
   transition, indicating that KL2 might mediate antitumor effect of
   simvastatin in SW1116 cells. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database indicated that KLF2 were positively
   correlated with CDKN1A (encoding p21(WAF1)(/CIP1)), both of which were
   down-regulated in colon cancer tissue, especially in p53 mutant colon
   cancer tissue. The results showed that KLF2 might be a tumor suppressor
   gene in colon cancer, which was in accordance with our experimental
   data. We also found that CDKNIA expression in mutant p53 colon cancer
   tissue was significant decreased when compared with p53 wild type colon
   cancer tissue, while Wnt ligand Wnt5a exhibited the highest level in p53
   mutant colon cancer tissue. These data provide strong evidences for
   clinical application of simvastatin in treatment of colon cancer with
   p53 mutation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Prognostic markers for glioblastoma are lacking. Both
   intrinsic tumour characteristics and microenvironment could influence
   cancer prognostic. The aim of our study was to generate a pure
   glioblastoma cell lines and immune classification in order to decipher
   the respective role of glioblastoma cell and microenvironment on
   prognosis.
   METHODS: We worked on two large cohorts of patients suffering from
   glioblastoma (TCGA, n = 481 and Rembrandt, n = 180) for which clinical
   data, transcriptomic profiles and outcome were recorded. Transcriptomic
   profiles of 129 pure glioblastoma cell lines were clustered to generate
   a glioblastoma cell lines classification. Presence of subtypes of
   glioblastoma cell lines and immune cells was determined using
   deconvolution.
   RESULTS: Glioblastoma cell lines classification defined three new
   molecular groups called oncogenic, metabolic and neuronal communication
   enriched. Neuronal communication-enriched tumours were associated with
   poor prognosis in both cohorts. Immune cell infiltrate was more frequent
   in mesenchymal classical classification subgroup and metabolic-enriched
   tumours. A combination of age, glioblastoma cell lines classification
   and immune classification could be used to determine patient's outcome
   in both cohorts.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that glioblastoma-bearing patients can be
   classified based on their age, glioblastoma cell lines classification
   and immune classification. The combination of these information improves
   the capacity to address prognosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common brain
   malignancy in adults, is generally aggressive and incurable, even with
   multiple treatment modalities and agents. Filamins (FLNs) are a group of
   actin-binding proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton in cells.
   However, the role of FLNs in malignancies-particularly in GBM-is
   unclear.
   METHODS: The relation between FLNC expression and overall survival in
   GBM was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis using GBM patients from
   the Kagoshima University Hospital (n = 90) and data from the Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 153). To assess FLNC function in GBM, cell
   migration and invasion were examined with Transwell and Matrigel
   invasion assays using FLNC-overexpressing U251MG and LN299 GBM cells,
   and ShRNA-mediated FLNC knocked-down KNS81 and U87MG cells. The gelatin
   zymography assay was used to estimate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2
   activity.
   RESULTS: In silico analysis of GBM patient data from TCGA and
   immunohistochemical analyses of clinical GBM specimens revealed that
   increased FLNC expression was associated with poor patient prognosis.
   FLNC overexpression in GBM cell lines was positively correlated with
   enhanced invasiveness, but not migration, and was accompanied by
   upregulation of MMP2.
   CONCLUSIONS: FLNC is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for
   GBM progression.

AB Background: It is well known that human clear cell renal cell carcinoma
   (ccRCC) is a highly immunogenic and chemo-resistant tumor. Recently,
   emerging data suggest that the immune checkpoint blockade therapy is an
   important breakthrough in the treatment against ccRCC. HHLA2, a recently
   reported member of B7 family, is uniquely expressed in humans but not in
   mice, and it plays an important role in the functional inhibition of CD4
   and CD8 T cells. Herein, we aimed to study the clinical implications of
   HHLA2 expression in human ccRCC and its potential regulatory role in the
   biological functions of the cancer cells.
   Methods: In the present study, we examined HHLA2 expression in human
   ccRCC tissues and analyzed the clinical implications as well as
   prognostic value. The intervention of HHLA2 in human ccRCC cell lines
   ACHN and 786-O was performed and its effect on the cellular function of
   the cells was also analyzed. We also identified the differentially
   expressed genes upon HHLA2 knockdown in ccRCC cell lines by using gene
   microarray analysis.
   Results: We found that higher HHLA2 mRNA expression level in human ccRCC
   tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues based on TCGA
   data, and the HHLA2 expression at mRNA level was positively and
   significantly correlated with PD-L1, PD-L2, B7-H6, but negatively and
   significantly correlated with B7-H3. Moreover, our immunohistochemistry
   study showed that the staining intensity of HHLA2 in human ccRCC tissues
   was significantly higher than that in the adjacent normal tissues, and
   the overall survival rate of ccRCC patients with higher HHLA2 expression
   was significantly poorer than that of the patients with lower HHLA2
   expression. Higher expression of HHLA2 in ccRCC tissues was positively
   and significantly associated with larger tumor size and advanced TNM
   stage. The COX model revealed that the parameters including patient's
   age, TNM stage and HHLA2 expression level could be used as the
   independent risk factors respectively for the prognostic prediction of
   the patients. Our cellular study showed that upon knockdown of HHLA2
   expression in human ccRCC cell lines, the cell viability, the migration
   and the invasion ability were significantly inhibited, while the cell
   cycle arrest at G1 phase was induced and the expressions of Cyclin D1,
   c-Myc and Cyclin E1 were decreased. In addition, according to the
   microarray data, the expressions of epithelia-to-mesenchymal transition
   markers, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin, were significantly
   changed after knockdown of HHLA2 expression.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicated that HHLA2 was involved in the
   progression of human ccRCC and could be used as an important prognostic
   predictor for this malignancy.

AB Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients experiencing lymph node
   metastasis (LNM) always exhibit poor clinical outcomes. A biomarker or
   gene signature that could predict survival in these patients would have
   a substantial clinical impact, allowing for earlier detection of
   mortality risk and for individualized therapy.
   Methods: With the aim to identify a novel mRNA signature associated with
   overall survival, we analysed LUAD patients with LNM extracted from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). LASSO Cox regression was applied to build
   the prediction model. An external cohort was applied to validate the
   prediction model.
   Results: We identified a 4-gene signature that could effectively
   stratify a high-risk subset of these patients, and time-dependent
   receiver operating characteristic (tROC) analysis indicated that the
   signature had a powerful predictive ability. Gene Set Enrichment
   Analysis (GSEA) showed that the high-risk subset was mainly associated
   with important cancer-related hallmarks. Moreover, a predictive nomogram
   was established based on the signature integrated with
   clinicopathological features. Lastly, the signature was validated by an
   external cohort from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
   Conclusion: In summary, we developed a robust mRNA signature as an
   independent factor to effectively classify LUAD patients with LNM into
   low- and high-risk groups, which might provide a basis for personalized
   treatments for these patients.

AB Pancreatic cancer is characterized by its rapid progression and early
   metastasis. This requires further elucidation of the key promoters for
   its progression and metastasis. In this study, we identified REST as the
   hub gene of a gene module which is closely associated with cancer stage
   by weighted gene correlation network analysis. Validation with the TCGA
   database, western blot analysis of human pancreatic cancer cell lines
   (AsPC-1, Capan-2, SW-1990, and PANC-1) and immunohistochemical analysis
   of paraffin-embedded pancreatic cancer tissue sections showed that REST
   was enriched in tissue samples of advanced stage and metastatic
   phenotype cell lines. Survival analysis with the TCGA database and our
   own follow-up data suggested that patients with higher expression level
   of REST showed worse overall survival rate. In vitro functional
   experiments suggested that knockdown of REST suppressed proliferation,
   migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of AsPC-1 and
   PANC-1 cells. In vivo experiments (a subcutaneous BALB/c nude mouse
   model and a superior mesenteric vein injection BALB/c nude mouse model)
   suggested that knockdown of REST suppressed growth and metastasis of
   xenograft tumor. Finally, we investigated the underlying molecular
   mechanism of REST and identified REST as a potential downstream target
   of MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results of bioinformatic
   analysis, in vitro and in vivo functional analysis suggested that REST
   may serve as a promoter of metastasis in pancreatic cancer.

TI Genetic Variants Associated with Cancer Therapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy.

PD 2019-Apr-16
PY 2019
AB BACKGROUND: Cancer therapy-induced cardiomyopathy (CCM) is associated
   with cumulative drug exposures and pre-existing cardiovascular
   disorders. These parameters incompletely account for substantial
   inter-individual susceptibility to CCM. We hypothesized that rare
   variants in cardiomyopathy genes contribute to CCM.
   METHODS: We studied 213 CCM patients from three cohorts: retrospectively
   recruited adults with diverse cancers (n=99), prospectively phenotyped
   breast cancer adults (n=73) and prospectively phenotyped children with
   acute myeloid leukemia (n=41). Cardiomyopathy genes, including nine
   pre-specified genes were sequenced. The prevalence of rare variants was
   compared between CCM cohorts and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   participants (n=2053), healthy volunteers (n=445), and ancestry-matched
   reference population. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were
   assessed, stratified by genotypes. A prevalent CCM genotype was modeled
   in anthracycline-treated mice.
   RESULTS: CCM was diagnosed 0.4-9 years after chemotherapy; 90% of these
   patients received anthracyclines. Adult CCM patients had cardiovascular
   risk factors similar to the U.S.
   POPULATION: Among nine prioritized genes CCM patients had more rare
   protein-altering variants than comparative cohorts (p≤1.98e-04).
   Titin-truncating variants (TTNtv) predominated, occurring in 7.5% CCM
   patients versus 1.1% TCGA participants (p=7.36e-08), 0.7% healthy
   volunteers (p=3.42e-06), and 0.6% reference population (p=5.87e-14).
   Adult CCM patients with TTNtv experienced more heart failure and atrial
   fibrillation (p=0.003) and impaired myocardial recovery (p=0.03) than
   those without. Consistent with human data, anthracycline-treated TTNtv
   mice and isolated TTNtv cardiomyocytes showed sustained contractile
   dysfunction unlike wildtype (p=0.0004 and p<0.002, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Unrecognized rare variants in cardiomyopathy-associated
   genes, particularly TTNtv, increased the risk for CCM in children and
   adults, and adverse cardiac events in adults. Genotype, along with
   cumulative chemotherapy dosage and traditional cardiovascular risk
   factors improves identification of cancer patients at highest risk for
   CCM.

AB Modern methods of acquiring molecular data have improved rapidly in
   recent years, making it easier for researchers to collect large volumes
   of information. However, this has increased the challenge of recognizing
   interesting patterns within the data. Atlas Correlation Explorer (ACE)
   is a user-friendly workbench for seeking associations between attributes
   in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. It allows any combination of
   clinical and genomic data streams to be searched using an evolutionary
   algorithm approach. To showcase ACE, we assessed which RNA sequencing
   transcripts were associated with estrogen receptor (ESR1) in the TCGA
   breast cancer cohort. The analysis revealed already well-established
   associations with XBP1 and FOXA1, but also identified a strong
   association with CT62, a potential immunotherapeutic target with few
   previous associations with breast cancer. In conclusion, ACE can produce
   results for very large searches in a short time and will serve as an
   increasingly useful tool for biomarker discovery in the big data era.
   Significance: ACE uses an evolutionary algorithm approach to perform
   large searches for associations between any combinations of data in the
   TCGA database.

AB Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to play
   an important role in the development and progression of various tumors,
   including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the regulatory molecular
   mechanism by lncRNA in CRC initiation and progression has not been fully
   clarified.
   Methods: TCGA database was used to identify the involvement of LINC01354
   in CRC. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to determine RNA and protein
   expression. The gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to
   explore the function of LINC01354 in the progression of CRC. In order to
   investigate the LINC01354-mediated mRNA in CRC tumorigenesis, we applied
   the profiling analysis as well as GO and KEGG analysis. Pulldown and RIP
   assays were applied to detect the interaction of hnRNP-D with LINC01354
   and beta-catenin.
   Results: The upregulation of LINC01354 in CRC and its prognostic
   significance were identified by TCGA database and confirmed in CRC
   tissues. Functionally, forced expression of LINC01354 promoted, while
   knockdown of LINC01354 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and EMT
   phenotype formation of CRC cells. A significant enrichment of the
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway genes under LINC01354 overexpression.
   In addition, LINC01354 modulated the mRNA stability of beta-catenin
   through interacting with hnRNP-D, thereby activating Wnt/beta-catenin
   signaling pathway.
   Conclusions: Our investigations proposed novel regulatory axis of
   LINC01354/hnRNP-D/Wnt/beta-catenin, which might be in favor of exploring
   novel therapeutic regimens for the clinical treatment of CRC.

AB Background: Metastasis remains the main cause of cancer-related death
   for gastric cancer (GC) patients, but the mechanisms are poorly
   understood. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data base and
   bioinformatics analyses, we identified C12orf59 might act as a potential
   oncogenic protein in GC.
   Methods: We investigate the expression pattern and clinical significance
   of C12orf59 in two independent cohorts of GC samples. In the training
   cohort, we used the X-tile program software to generate the optimal
   cutoff value for C12orf59 expression in order to classify patients
   accurately according to clinical outcome. In the validation cohort, this
   derived cutoff score was applied to exam the association of C12orf59
   expression with survival outcome. A series of in vivo and in vitro
   assays were then performed to investigate the function of C12orf59 in
   GC.
   Results: C12orf59 was significantly upregulated, and associated with
   poor survival outcome in two cohorts of GC samples. Gain- and loss
   of-function studies demonstrated C12orf59 promotes GC cell invasive and
   metastatic capacity both in vitro and in vivo, and induces
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis. Mechanically,
   C12orf59 exerts oncogenic functions by up-regulating CDH11 expression
   via NF-kappa B signaling. Interesting, CDH11 could in turn promote
   NF-kappa B bind to C12orf59's promoter and form a positive feedback loop
   to sustain the metastatic ability of GC cells. Additionally,
   downregulation of miR-654-5p is another important mechanism for C12orf59
   overexpression in GC.
   Conclusion: Our finding suggested the newly identified C12orf59/NF-kappa
   B/CDH11 feedback loop may represent a new strategy for GC treatment.

AB Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents one
   of the most common malignancies worldwide with a high mortality rate
   mainly due to lack of early detection markers, frequent association with
   metastasis and aggressive phenotype. Recently, long non-coding RNAs
   (lncRNAs) have been shown to have important regulatory roles in human
   cancers. The lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript1 (PCAT-1)
   showed potential oncogenic roles in different cancers, however its role
   in HNSCC is not known. In this study, we evaluated the role of the
   PCAT-1 in HNSCC.
   Methods: The expression of PCAT-1 was measured by quantitative real-time
   PCR in 23 paired human HNSCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissue
   specimens. Cell proliferation after depleting PCAT-1 was determined.
   Effect of PCAT-1 depletion in HNSCC cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR
   and Western blot analyses. Finally, JHU029 HNSCC cells was implanted
   subcutaneously into athymic nude mice and therapeutic potential of
   PCAT-1 was investigated.
   Results: Up-regulation of PCAT-1 in TCGA dataset of HNSCC was noted. We
   also observed increased expression of PCAT-1 in archived HNSCC patient
   samples as compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Knockdown of PCAT-1
   significantly reduced cell proliferation in HNSCC cell lines.
   Mechanistic study revealed significant down regulation of c-Myc and AKT1
   gene in both RNA and protein levels upon knockdown of PCAT-1. We
   observed that c-Myc and AKT1 positively correlate with PCAT-1 expression
   in HNSCC. Further, we observed activation of p38 MAPK and apoptosis
   signal-regulating kinase 1 upon knockdown of PCAT-1 which induces
   Caspase 9 and PARP mediated apoptosis. Targeted inhibition of PCAT-1
   regresses tumor growth in nude mice.
   Conclusion: Together our data demonstrated an important role of the
   PCAT-1 in HNSCC and might serve as a target for HNSCC therapy.

   in the process of gastric cancer (GC) and to elucidate its possible
   regulatory mechanism. The expression data of GC tissues and matched
   normal tissues were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database. Survival analysis for GC patients with different levels of
   TCF12 was performed by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. In addition, TCF12 was
   suppressed in human GC cell lines AGS and MKN-45, followed by detecting
   cell biological processes (proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and
   invasion). Moreover, the association between TCF12 and the
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signal was elucidated. Besides,
   the potential micro RNAs that could target TCF12 expression were
   explored. The results showed that TCF12 was highly expressed in GC
   tissues and TCF12 upregulation was associated with poor prognosis of GC
   patients. In addition, suppression of TCF12 significantly inhibited the
   proliferation, migration, and invasion of both AGS and MKN45 cells, as
   well as induced apoptosis of the two cell lines. Moreover, suppression
   of TCF12 significantly decreased the expression of p-AKT, cyclin D1,
   p-P70, and beta-catenin in both AGS and MKN45 cells. Besides, TCF12 was
   target regulated by miR-183 in GC cells. Our findings reveal that TCF12
   is upregulated in GC and its upregulation is associated with poor
   prognosis of GC patients. To sum up, downregulation of TCF12 may inhibit
   GC development via being target regulated by miR-183 and inhibiting the
   PI3K/AKT signal. TCF12 may function as a potential therapeutic target
   for GC.

AB Background: The current study aimed to identify potential diagnostic and
   prognostic gene biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) based on the Gene
   Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   dataset.
   Methods: Microarray data of gene expression profiles of CRC from GEO and
   RNA-sequencing dataset of CRC from TCGA were downloaded. After screening
   overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by R software,
   functional enrichment analyses of the DEGs were performed using the
   DAVID database. Then, the STRING database and Cytoscape were used to
   construct a protein protein interaction (PPI) network and identify hub
   genes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted
   to assess the diagnostic values of the hub genes. Cox proportional
   hazards regression was performed to screen the potential prognostic
   genes. Kaplan-Meier curve and the time-dependent ROC curve were used to
   assess the prognostic values of the potential prognostic genes for CRC
   patients.
   Results: Integrated analysis of GEO and TCGA databases revealed 207
   common DEGs in CRC. A PPI network consisted of 70 nodes and 170 edges
   were constructed and top 10 hub genes were identified. The area under
   curve (AUC) of the ROC curves of the hub genes were 0.900, 0.927, 0.869,
   0.863, 0.980, 0.682, 0.903, 0.790, 0.995, and 0.989 for CCL19, CXCL1,
   CXCL5, CXCL11, CXCL12, GNG4, INSL5, NMU, PYY, and SST, respectively. A
   prognostic gene signature consisted of 9 genes including SLC4A4, NFE2L3,
   GLDN, PCOLCE2, TIMP1, CCL28, SCGB2A1, AXIN2, and MMP1 was constructed
   with a good performance in predicting overall survivals of CRC patients.
   The AUC of the time-dependent ROC curve was 0.741 for 5-year survival.
   Conclusion: The results in this study might provide some directive
   significance for further exploring the potential biomarkers for
   diagnosis and prognosis prediction of CRC patients.

AB The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays key roles in promoting disease
   progression in the aggressive triple-negative subtype of breast cancer
   (TNBC; Basal/Basal-like). Here, we took an integrative approach and
   determined the impact of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks on
   pro-metastatic phenotypes in TNBC. With the TOGA dataset we found that
   the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)
   and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), as well as their target
   pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL2 (MCP-1), and CCL5 (RANTES)
   were expressed at significantly higher levels in basal patients than
   luminal-A patients. Then, we found that TNF alpha- or IL-1
   beta-stimulated co-cultures of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468,
   BT-549) with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressed significantly
   higher levels of CXCL8 compared to non-stimulated co-cultures or each
   cell type alone, with or without cytokine stimulation. CXCL8 was also
   up-regulated in TNBC co-cultures with breast cancer-associated
   fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from patients. CM and CCL5 also reached the
   highest expression levels in TNF alpha/IL-1 beta-stimulated TNBC:MSC/CAF
   co-cultures. The elevations in CXCL8 and CCL2 expression partly depended
   on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the MSCs/CAFs,
   whereas CCL5 up-regulation was entirely dependent on cell-to-cell
   contacts. Supernatants of TNF alpha-stimulated TNBC:MSC "Contact"
   co-cultures induced robust endothelial cell migration and sprouting.
   TNBC cells co-cultured with MSCs and TNF alpha gained migration-related
   morphology and potent migratory properties; they also became more
   invasive when co-cultured with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of TNF alpha.
   Using siRNA to CXCL8, we found that CXCL8 was significantly involved in
   mediating the pro-metastatic activities gained by TNF alpha-stimulated
   TNBC:MSC "Contact" co-cultures: angiogenesis, migration-related
   morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and
   invasion. Importantly, TNF alpha stimulation of TNBC:MSC "Contact"
   co-cultures in vitro has increased the aggressiveness of the tumor cells
   in vivo, leading to higher incidence of mice with lung metastases than
   non-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures. Similar tumor-stromal-inflammation
   networks established in-culture with luminal-A cells demonstrated less
   effective or differently-active pro-metastatic functions than those of
   TNBC cells. Overall, our studies identify novel
   tumor-stroma-inflammation networks that may promote TNBC aggressiveness
   by increasing the pro-malignancy potential of the TME and of the tumor
   cells themselves, and reveal key roles for CXCL8 in mediating these
   metastasis-promoting activities.

AB DEP domain containing 1 (DEPDC1) is a novel tumor-associated gene, which
   is aberrantly expressed in multiple types of cancer and involves in
   tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Here, we examined the functional
   involvement and underlying mechanism of DEPDC1 in breast cancer. In this
   study, the immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that DEPDC1 was
   high-expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with the paired
   adjacent normal breast tissues, and its tendency at protein level was
   consistent with mRNA level from TCGA data. Moreover, DEPDC1 mRNA level
   revealed the strongest association with poor prognosis and development
   in breast cancer. In vitro assays showed that DEPDC1 overexpression
   resulted in significant promotion of proliferation by regulating cell
   cycle in MCF-7 cells, whilst an opposite effect was found in the
   MDA-MB-231 cells with DEPDC1 deletion. Notably, further investigation
   indicated DEPDC1's ability of promoting breast cancer cells migration
   and invasion. In addition, we discovered that DEPDC1 caused
   hyper-activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in breast cancer cells.
   Therefore, the increased DEPDC1 expression in breast cancer is
   correlated with disease progression and poor survival, which suggested
   that DEPDC1 might be a potential therapeutic target against this
   disease.

AB Cancers converge onto shared patterns that arise from constraints placed
   by the biology of the originating cell lineage and microenvironment on
   programs driven by oncogenic events. Here we define consistent
   expression modules reflecting this structure in colon and breast cancer
   by exploiting expression data resources and a new computationally
   efficient approach that we validate against other comparable methods.
   This approach, Parsimonious Gene Correlation Network Analysis (PGCNA),
   allows comparison of network structures between these cancer types
   identifying shared modules of gene co-expression reflecting: cancer
   hallmarks, functional and structural gene batteries, copy number
   variation and biology of originating lineage. These networks along with
   the mapping of outcome data at gene and module level provide an
   interactive resource that generates context for relationships between
   genes within and between such modules. Assigning module expression
   values (MEVs) provides a tool to summarize network level gene expression
   in individual cases illustrating potential utility in classification and
   allowing analysis of linkage between module expression and mutational
   state. Exploiting TCGA data thus defines both recurrent patterns of
   association between module expression and mutation at data-set level,
   and exemplifies the polarization of mutation patterns with the leading
   edge of module expression at individual case level. We illustrate the
   scalable nature of the approach within immune response related modules,
   which in the context of breast cancer demonstrates the selective
   association of immune subsets, in particular mast cells, with the
   underlying mutational pattern. Together our analyses provide evidence
   for a generalizable framework to enhance molecular stratification in
   cancer.

AB Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as microRNA (miRNA)
   sponges to regulate protein-coding gene expression; therefore, lncRNAs
   are considered a major part of the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA)
   network and have attracted growing attention. The present study explored
   the regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of lncRNAs as ceRNAs in
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their potential impact on HCC patient
   prognosis.
   Methods: In this study, we systematically studied the expression
   profiles and prognostic value of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA from a total of
   838 HCC patients from five HCC cohorts (TCGA, GSE54236, GSE76427,
   GSE64041 and GSE14520). The TCGA, GSE54236 and GSE76427 HCC cohorts were
   utilized to establish a prognosis-related network of dysregulated ceRNAs
   by bioinformatics methods. The GSE64041 and GSE14520 HCC cohorts were
   utilized to verify the expression of candidate genes.
   Results: In total, 721 lncRNAs, 73 miRNAs, and 1563 mRNAs were
   aberrantly expressed in HCC samples. A ceRNA network including 26
   lncRNAs, four miRNAs, and six mRNAs specific to HCC was established. The
   survival analysis showed that four lncRNAs (MYCNOS, DLX6-AS1, LINC00221,
   and CRNDE) and two mRNAs (CCNB1 and SHCBP1) were prognostic biomarkers
   for patients with HCC in both the TCGA and GEO databases.
   Conclusion: The proposed ceRNA network may help elucidate the regulatory
   mechanism by which lncRNAs function as ceRNAs and contribute to the
   pathogenesis of HCC. Importantly, the candidate lncRNAs, miRNAs, and
   mRNAs involved in the ceRNA network can be further evaluated as
   potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for HCC.

AB Background: The homeodomain transcription factor, PITX2 is associated
   with tumorigenesis of multiple cancers. In this research, we aimed to
   study the expression, function and mechanism of PITX2 in lung
   adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
   Methods: The TCGA dataset was used to analyze the expression and
   clinical significance of PITX2 in LUAD. The expression of PITX2 in tumor
   samples and LUAD cell lines was examined by quantitative real-time PCR
   (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were
   constructed to knockdown PITX2 and to determine the physiological
   function of PITX2 in vitro. Xenograft model was used to confirm the role
   of PITX2 in vivo.
   Results: PITX2 was overexpressed in LUAD and patients with high level of
   PITX2 had a worse overall survival and an advanced clinical stage.
   Knockdown of PITX2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion
   of LUAD cells. Further study revealed that the oncogenic role of PITX2
   was dependent on activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway,
   especially by transcriptionally regulating the Wnt gene family member,
   WNT3A. Lastly, we identified miR-140-5p as a negative mediator of PITX2
   by binding its 3'UTR and ectopic expression of miR-140-5p inhibited
   progression of LUAD cells via suppressing the expression of PITX2.
   Conclusions: Up-regulation of PITX2 acts as an oncogene in LUAD by
   activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting that PITX2 may
   serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in LUAD.

AB Metastasis to distant organs is a major cause for solid cancer
   mortality, and the acquisition of migratory and invasive phenotype is a
   key factor in initiation of malignancy. In this study we investigated
   the contribution of Mixed-Lineage Kinase 4 (MLK4) to aggressive
   phenotype of breast cancer cells. Our TCGA cancer genomic data analysis
   revealed that amplification or mRNA upregulation of MLK4 occurred in 23%
   of invasive breast carcinoma cases. To find the association between MLK4
   expression and the specific subtype of breast cancer, we performed a
   transcriptomic analysis of multiple datasets, which showed that MLK4 is
   highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer compared to other
   molecular subtypes. Depletion of MLK4 in cell lines with high MLK4
   expression impaired proliferation and anchorage-dependent colony
   formation. Moreover, silencing of MLK4 expression significantly reduced
   the migratory potential and invasiveness of breast cancer cells as well
   as the number of spheroids formed in 3D cultures. These in vitro
   findings translate into slower rate of tumor growth in mice upon MLK4
   knock-down. Furthermore, we established that MLK4 activates NF-kappa B
   signaling and promotes a mesenchymal phenotype in breast cancer cells.
   Immunohistochemical staining of samples obtained from breast cancer
   patients revealed a strong positive correlation between high expression
   of MLK4 and metastatic potential of tumors, which was predominantly
   observed in TNBC subgroup. Taken together, our results show that high
   expression of MLK4 promotes migratory and invasive phenotype of breast
   cancer and may represent a novel target for anticancer treatment.

AB The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with the
   pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the
   mechanisms by which miR-516a-5p contributes to NSCLC remain unclear. The
   association between miR-516a-5p expression and the clinicopathological
   characteristics and prognosis in patients with NSCLC was analyzed by The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set. The targets of miR-516a-5p were
   identified by bioinformatic analysis and luciferase report assay. MTT
   and soft agar assays were conducted to investigate the function of
   miR-516a-5p in NSCLC cells. We found that the expression of miR-516a-5p
   was decreased in NSCLC tissues and associated with the age, pathological
   stage, and tumor size, acting as an independent prognostic factor of
   tumor recurrence in patients with NSCLC. Restoration of miR-516a-5p
   inhibited the cell viability and anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC
   cells, but its inhibitor had the opposite effects. Histone cluster 3 H2A
   (HIST3H2A) was further identified as a direct target of miR-516a-5p and
   displayed a negative correlation with miR-516a-5p expression in NSCLC
   tissues. Overexpression of HIST3H2A reversed the anti-proliferation
   effects induced by miR-516a-5p and acted as an independent prognostic
   factor of poor survival in patients with NSCLC. Altogether, our findings
   demonstrate that miR-516a-5p may function as a tumor suppressive factor
   in NSCLC cells by targeting HIST3H2A and might represent a potential
   indicator of tumor recurrence in patients with NSCLC.

AB Although the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is useful in the
   treatment of several cancers, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is refractory to
   this drug. Among other mechanisms of chemoresistance, impaired uptake
   through human organic cation transporter type 1 (hOCT1) (gene SLC22A1)
   has been suggested. Here we have investigated the events accounting for
   this phenotypic characteristic and have evaluated the interest of
   selective gene therapy strategies to overcome this limitation. Gene
   expression and DNA methylation of SLC22A1 were analyzed using
   intrahepatic (iCCA) and extrahepatic (eCCA) biopsies (Copenhagen and
   Salamanca cohorts; n=132) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-CHOL
   (n=36). Decreased hOCT1 mRNA correlated with hypermethylation status of
   the SLC22A1 promoter. Treatment of CCA cells with decitabine
   (demethylating agent) or butyrate (histone deacetylase inhibitor)
   restored hOCT1 expression and increased sorafenib uptake. MicroRNAs able
   to induce hOCT1 mRNA decay were analyzed in paired samples of TCGA-CHOL
   (n=9) and Copenhagen (n=57) cohorts. Consistent up-regulation in tumor
   tissue was found for miR-141 and miR-330. High proportion of aberrant
   hOCT1 mRNA splicing in CCA was also seen. Lentiviral-mediated
   transduction of eCCA (EGI-1 and TFK-1) and iCCA (HuCCT1) cells with
   hOCT1 enhanced sorafenib uptake and cytotoxic effects. In chemically
   induced CCA in rats, reduced rOct1 expression was accompanied by
   impaired sorafenib uptake. In xenograft models of eCCA cells implanted
   in mouse liver, poor response to sorafenib was observed. However, tumor
   growth was markedly reduced by cotreatment with sorafenib and adenoviral
   vectors encoding hOCT1 under the control of the BIRC5 promoter, a gene
   highly up-regulated in CCA. Conclusion: The reason for impaired
   hOCT1-mediated sorafenib uptake by CCA is multifactorial. Gene therapy
   capable of selectively inducing hOCT1 in tumor cells can be considered a
   potentially useful chemosensitization strategy to improve the response
   of CCA to sorafenib.

   relations. Furthermore, 6 of 10 lncRNAs in TCGA database were consistent
   with GEO database, and expressions of 10 mRNAs in TCGA database all
   exhibited the same tendency with GEO database. Notably, we found 8
   lncRNAs (WDFY3-AS2, CASC8, UGDH-AS1, RAP2C-AS1, AC007128.1, AC016205.1,
   AC092803.2 and AC079949.2) were correlated with overall survival of the
   patients with ESCA. The key differentially expressed genes participate
   in the development and progression of ESCA, and thus the elucidation of
   functions of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA will provide new novel therapeutic target
   for the patients with ESCA.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of transcripts, which can
   regulate the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
   According to the data of TCGA, Ladybird homeobox 2 antisense RNA 1
   (LBX2-AS1) is a highly expressed lncRNA in ESCC samples. Herein, we
   chose it for further study. Furtherly, dysregulation of LBX2-AS1 was
   identified in ESCC tissues with metastasis. Loss-of function assays were
   conducted and revealed that LBX2-AS1 knockdown suppressed ESCC cell
   migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Zinc finger E-box
   binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2
   (ZEB2) are two EMT-related transcription factors. Since LBX2-AS1
   promoted the EMT progress and simultaneously enhanced the level of ZEB1
   and ZEB2, we further investigated whether LBX2-AS1 promoted cell
   migration and EMT in ESCC by regulating ZEB1 and ZEB2. Mechanism
   investigations revealed that RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear
   ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC) could interact with LBX2-AS1, ZEB1 and
   ZEB2, simultaneously. The similar function of HNRNPC in regulating
   migration and EMT process was demonstrated. ZEBI has been reported as a
   positive transcriptional regulator of lncRNA. Therefore, further
   mechanism analysis was made to demonstrate whether ZEB1 could regulate
   the transcription of LBX2-AS1. Collectively, our data showed that
   ZEB1-induced upregulation of LBX2-AS1 promoted cell migration and EMT
   process in ESCC via enhancing the stability of ZEB1 and ZEB2. (C) 2019

AB Background: CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is found in 15-20% of
   malignant colorectal tumors and is characterized by strong CpG
   hypermethylation over the genome. The molecular mechanisms of this
   phenomenon are not still fully understood. The development of CIMP is
   followed by global gene expression alterations and metabolic changes. In
   particular, CIMP-low colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), predominantly
   corresponded to consensus molecular subtype 3 (CMS3, "Metabolic")
   subgroup according to COAD molecular classification, is associated with
   elevated expression of genes participating in metabolic pathways.
   Methods: We performed bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project for CIMP-high and non-CIMP COAD
   samples with DESeq2, clusterProfiler, and topGO R packages. Obtained
   results were validated on a set of fourteen COAD samples with matched
   morphologically normal tissues using quantitative PCR (qPCR).
   Results: Upregulation of multiple genes involved in glycolysis and
   related processes (ENO2, PFKP, HK3, PKM, ENO1, HK2, PGAM1, GAPDH, ALDOA,
   GPI, TPI1, and HK1) was revealed in CIMP-high tumors compared to
   non-CIMP ones. Most remarkably, the expression of the PKLR gene,
   encoding for pyruvate kinase participating in gluconeogenesis, was
   decreased approximately 20-fold. Up to 8-fold decrease in the expression
   of OGDHL gene involved in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was observed in
   CIMP-high tumors. Using qPCR, we confirmed the increase (4-fold) in the
   ENO2 expression and decrease (2-fold) in the OGDHL mRNA level on a set
   of COAD samples.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated the association between CIMP-high status
   and the energy metabolism changes at the transcriptomic level in
   colorectal adenocarcinoma against the background of immune pathway
   activation. Differential methylation of at least nine CpG sites in OGDHL
   promoter region as well as decreased OGDHL mRNA level can potentially
   serve as an additional biomarker of the CIMP-high status in COAD.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary CNS cancer and
   has a poor prognosis. This study searched for significant genes and the
   mechanisms involved in GBM.
   We used the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to test the WHO normal and IV
   glioma database, used R tool to identify the significant gene, and
   finally, combined these with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to verify
   the significant genes. Subsequently, we explored the biological
   mechanisms involved.
   Phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase-interacting protein-like gene (PHYHIPL) is
   downregulated in grade IV glioma (GBM). The downregulation of PHYHIPL in
   GBM is accompanied by poor overall survival in the TCGA database, which
   indicates that PHYHIPL is a protection gene in GBM development.
   Bioinformatics analysis shows that the poor prognosis with downregulated
   PHYHIPL may be the result of the TNF signaling pathway and the IL-17
   signaling pathway, but good prognosis accompanied by upregulated PHYHIPL
   may be the result of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and the cAMP
   signaling pathway. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) net indicated that
   PHYHIPL may play a vital role in cell metabolism, and we hypothesize
   that the downregulation mechanism may be the result of mutations of the
   beta-catenin gene and the endogenous siRNA, as shown in previous
   studies.
   PHYHIPL may be a target gene for the treatment and prognosis of GBM.

AB Background: More and more recent studies have clearly shown that long
   non-coding RNA (lncRNA) should be considered as a fundamental part of
   the ceRNA network, mainly because lncRNA can act as miRNA sponges to
   regulate the protein-coding gene expression. Nevertheless, it is still
   not clear how lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs function in cervical squamous cell
   carcinoma (CESC). Moreover, information about the ceRNA regulatory
   mechanism is also remarkably limited; thus, prediction of CESC prognosis
   using ceRNA-related information remains challenging.
   Material/Methods: We collected 306 RNA (lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA)
   expression profile datasets obtained from cervical squamous cancer
   tissues plus 3 more from adjacent cervical tissues via the TCGA
   database. Subsequently, we constructed a lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs CESC ceRNA
   network, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was carried out.
   Results: We identified a total of 30 DElncRNAs, 70 DEmiRNAs, and 1089
   DEmRNAs in CESC. Subsequently, to reveal the expression patterns of
   dysregulated genes, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was
   carried out, resulting in 3 co-expression modules with significantly
   related clinical properties. The constructed aberrant
   lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs CESC ceRNA network was composed of 17 DEmiRNAs, 5
   DElncRNAs, and 7 DEmRNAs. Moreover, the survival analysis was performed
   for DElncRNAs, DEmiRNAs, and DEmRNAs.
   Conclusions: The present study shows the involvement of the
   lncRNA-related ceRNA network in the pathogenesis of CESC. We believe the
   newly generated ceRNA network will provide more insights into the
   lncRNA-mediated ceRNA regulatory mechanisms.

AB Our previous work demonstrated cancer-testis (CT) genes as a new source
   of candidate driver of cancer. Recently, mounting evidence indicates
   that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with CT expression pattern could play
   a pivotal role in cancer biology. Here, we characterized a conserved CT
   long noncoding RNA (CT-lncRNA), PCAT6, which is expressed exclusively in
   the testis and is reactivated in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC)
   tissues due to the highly frequent amplification. The expression in LIHC
   was correlated with clinical prognosis in TCGA data. Knockdown of PCAT6
   could inhibit cell proliferation and migration in hepatocellular
   carcinoma (LIHC) cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on
   coexpression network revealed that PCAT6 was involved in similar
   cilium-related pathways in the testis and LIHC tissues. However, PCAT6
   was mainly positively correlated with gametogenesis-related pathways in
   the testis but was coexpressed with mitotic cell cycle genes in LIHC.
   Together, our data demonstrated that CT-lncRNA PCAT6 represents the
   similarity and difference between tumorigenesis and gametogenesis. The
   CT expression pattern and important role in LIHC oncogenesis make PCAT6
   an ideal target for LIHC diagnosis and therapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Genetic risk score (GRS) is an odds ratio (OR)-weighted and
   population-standardized method for measuring cumulative effect of
   multiple risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We
   hypothesize that GRS is a valid tool for risk assessment of most common
   cancers.
   METHODS: Utilizing genotype and phenotype data from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) and Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), we
   tested 11 cancer-specific GRSs (bladder, breast, colorectal, glioma,
   lung, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, and thyroid
   cancer) for association with the respective cancer type. Cancer-specific
   GRSs were calculated, for the first time in these cohorts, based on
   previously published risk-associated SNPs using the Caucasian subjects
   in these two cohorts.
   RESULTS: Mean cancer-specific GRS in the population controls of eMERGE
   approximated the expected value of 1.00 (between 0.98 and 1.02) for all
   11 types of cancer. Mean cancer-specific GRS was consistently higher in
   respective cancer patients than controls for all 11 types of cancer
   (P<0.05). When subjects were categorized into low-, average-, and
   high-risk groups based on cancer-specific GRS (<0.5, 0.5-1.5, and >1.5,
   respectively), significant dose-response associations of higher
   cancer-specific GRS with higher OR of respective type of cancer were
   found for nine types of cancer (P-trend <0.05). More than 64% subjects
   in the population controls of eMERGE can be classified as high risk for
   at least one type of these cancers.
   CONCLUSION: Validity of GRS for predicting cancer risk is demonstrated
   for most types of cancer. If confirmed in larger studies,
   cancer-specific GRS may have the potential for developing personalized
   cancer screening strategy.

AB The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway is a central
   regulator of metabolism in all cells. It senses intracellular and
   extracellular signals and nutrient levels, and coordinates the metabolic
   requirements for cell growth, survival, and proliferation. Genetic
   alterations that deregulate mTOR signalling lead to metabolic
   reprogramming, resulting in the development of several cancers including
   those of the head and neck. Gain-of-function mutations in EGFR, PIK3CA,
   and HRAS, or loss-of-function in p53 and PTEN are often associated with
   mTOR hyperactivation, whereas mutations identified from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset that potentially lead to aberrant mTOR
   signalling are found in the EIF4G1, PLD1, RAC1, and SZT2 genes. In this
   review, we discuss how these mutant genes could affect mTOR signalling
   and highlight their impact on metabolic processes, as well as suggest
   potential targets for therapeutic intervention, primarily in head and

   worldwide and the 8th most common in women. The aim of this study was to
   diagnose the potential importance of, as well as novel genes linked
   with, EOC and to provide valid biological information for further
   research. The gene expression profiles of E-MTAB-3706 which contained
   four high-grade ovarian epithelial cancer samples, four normal fallopian
   tube samples and four normal ovarian epithelium samples were downloaded
   from the ArrayExpress database. Pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology
   (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
   performed, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network,
   microRNA-target gene regulatory network and TFs (transcription factors )
   -target gene regulatory network for up- and down-regulated were analyzed
   using Cytoscape. In total, 552 DEGs were found, including 276
   up-regulated and 276 down-regulated DEGs. Pathway enrichment analysis
   demonstrated that most DEGs were significantly enriched in chemical
   carcinogenesis, urea cycle, cell adhesion molecules and creatine
   biosynthesis. GO enrichment analysis showed that most DEGs were
   significantly enriched in translation, nucleosome, extracellular matrix
   organization and extracellular matrix. From protein-protein interaction
   network (PPI) analysis, modules, microRNA-target gene regulatory network
   and TFs-target gene regulatory network for up- and down-regulated, and
   the top hub genes such as E2F4, SRPK2, A2M, CDH1, MAP1LC3A, UCHL1, HLA-C
   (major histocompatibility complex, class I, C) , VAT1, ECM1 and SNRPN
   (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N) were associated in
   pathogenesis of EOC. The high expression levels of the hub genes such as
   CEBPD (CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta) and MID2 in stages 3 and 4
   were validated in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. CEBPD
   andMID2 were associated with the worst overall survival rates in EOC. In
   conclusion, the current study diagnosed DEGs between normal and EOC
   samples, which could improve our understanding of the molecular
   mechanisms in the progression of EOC. These new key biomarkers might be
   used as therapeutic targets for EOC.

AB Non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) protein plays an important role in cell
   cytokinesis and cell migration. The role and underlying regulatory
   mechanisms of NMIIA in pancreatic cancer (PC) remain elusive. We found
   that NMIIA is highly expressed in PC tissues and contributes to PC poor
   progression by using open microarray datasets from the Gene Expression
   Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and PC tissue arrays.
   NMIIA regulates beta-catenin mediated EMT to promote the proliferation,
   migration, invasion, and sphere formation of PC cells in vitro and in
   vivo. NMIIA controls the beta-catenin transcriptional activity by
   interacting with beta-catenin. Moreover, MEK/ERK signaling is critical
   in MLC2 (Ser19) phosphorylation, which can mediate NMIIA activity and
   regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. These findings highlight the
   significance of NMIIA in tumor regression and implicate NMIIA as a
   promising candidate for PC treatment.

AB Murine liver tumors often fail to recapitulate the complexity of human
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which might explain the difficulty to
   translate preclinical mouse studies into clinical science. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate a subtyping approach for murine liver cancer
   models with regard to etiology-defined categories of human HCC,
   comparing genomic changes, histomorphology, and IHC profiles. Sequencing
   and analysis of gene copy-number changes [by comparative genomic
   hybridization (CGH)] in comparison with etiology-dependent subsets of
   HCC patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were conducted
   using specimens (75 tumors) of five different HCC mouse models:
   diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treated wild-type C57BL/6 mice, c-Myc and
   AlbLTalphabeta transgenic mice as well as TAK1LPC-KO and Mcl-1Deltahep
   mice. Digital microscopy was used for the assessment of morphology and
   IHC of liver cell markers (A6-CK7/19, glutamine synthetase) in mouse and
   n = 61 human liver tumors. Tumor CGH profiles of DEN-treated mice and
   c-Myc transgenic mice matched alcohol-induced HCC, including morphologic
   findings (abundant inclusion bodies, fatty change) in the DEN model.
   Tumors from AlbLTalphabeta transgenic mice and TAK1LPC-KO models
   revealed the highest overlap with NASH-HCC CGH profiles. Concordant
   morphology (steatosis, lymphocyte infiltration, intratumor
   heterogeneity) was found in AlbLTalphabeta murine livers. CGH profiles
   from the Mcl-1Deltahep model displayed similarities with
   hepatitis-induced HCC and characteristic human-like phenotypes (fatty
   change, intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity).Implications: Our
   findings demonstrate that stratifying preclinical mouse models along
   etiology-oriented genotypes and human-like phenotypes is feasible. This
   closer resemblance of preclinical models is expected to better
   recapitulate HCC subgroups and thus increase their informative value.

AB The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a rich resource that can be used
   to understand how genes interact in cancer cells and has collected
   RNA-Seq gene expression data for many types of human cancer. However,
   mining the data to uncover the hidden gene-interaction patterns remains
   a challenge. Gaussian graphical model (GGM) is often used to learn
   genetic networks because it defines an undirected graphical structure,
   revealing the conditional dependences of genes. In this study, we focus
   on inferring gene interactions in 15 specific types of human cancer
   using RNA-Seq expression data and GGM with graphical lasso. We take
   advantage of the corresponding Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
   pathway maps to define the subsets of related genes. RNA-Seq expression
   levels of the subsets of genes in solid cancerous tumor and normal
   tissues were extracted from TCGA. The gene expression data sets were
   cleaned and formatted, and the genetic network corresponding to each
   cancer type was then inferred using GGM with graphical lasso. The
   inferred networks reveal stable conditional dependences among the genes
   at the expression level and confirm the essential roles played by the
   genes that encode proteins involved in the two key signaling pathway
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK in human
   carcinogenesis. These stable dependences elucidate the expression level
   interactions among the genes that are implicated in many different human
   cancers. The inferred genetic networks were examined to further identify
   and characterize a collection of gene interactions that are unique to
   cancer. The cross-cancer genetic interactions revealed from our study
   provide another set of knowledge for cancer biologists to propose strong
   hypotheses, so further biological investigations can be conducted
   effectively.

   leading to abnormal expression of different genes as important
   regulators of disease onset and progression in HCC. Here, using systems
   biology approaches, we aimed to integrate methylation, miRNA profiling
   and gene expression data into a regulatory methylation-miRNA-mRNA
   (meth-miRNA-mRNA) network to better understand the onset and progression
   of the disease.MethodsPatients' gene methylation, miRNA expression and
   gene expression data were retrieved from the NCBI GEO and TCGA
   databases. Differentially methylated genes, and differentially expressed
   miRNAs and genes were identified by comparing respective patients' data
   using two tailed Student's t-test. Functional annotation and pathway
   enrichment, miRNA-mRNA inverse pairing and gene set enrichment analyses
   (GSEA) were performed using DAVID, miRDIP v4.1 and GSEA tools
   respectively. meth-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape
   v3.5.1. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed using R script and
   significance was calculated by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.ResultsWe
   identified differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and differentially
   methylated genes in HCC as compared to normal adjacent tissues by
   analyzing gene expression, miRNA expression, and methylation profiling
   data of HCC patients and integrated top miRNAs along with their mRNA
   targets and their methylation profile into a regulatory meth-miRNA-mRNA
   network using systems biology approach. Pathway enrichment analyses of
   identified genes revealed suppressed metabolic pathways and hyperactive
   cell cycle signaling as key features of HCC onset and progression which
   we validated in 10 different HCC patients' datasets. Next, we confirmed
   the inverse correlation between gene methylation and its expression, and
   between miRNA and its targets' expression in various datasets.
   Furthermore, we validated the clinical significance of identified
   methylation, miRNA and mRNA signatures by checking their association
   with clinical features and survival of HCC patients.ConclusionsOverall,
   we suggest that simultaneous (1) reversal of hyper-methylation and/or
   oncogenic miRNA driven suppression of genes involved in metabolic
   pathways, and (2) induction of hyper-methylation and/or tumor suppressor
   miRNA driven suppression of genes involved in cell cycle signaling have
   potential of inhibiting disease aggressiveness, and predicting good
   survival in HCC.

AB Long non-coding RNA FOXD2 Adjacent Opposite Strand RNA 1 (FOXD2-AS1) has
   been widely reported to be implicated in the progression and recurrence
   of several cancers. The clinical significance and functional role of
   FOXD2-AS1 in thyroid carcinoma remain unknown. FOXD2-AS1 expression was
   evaluated by analyzing thyroid cancer RNA sequencing dataset from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In vitro and in vivo assays were performed
   to assess the biological roles of FOXD2-AS1 in thyroid cancer cells.
   Western blot, luciferase, immunoprecipitation (IP), and RNA
   immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to identify the underlying
   miRNA and mRNA target mediating the biological roles of FOXD2-AS1 in
   thyroid cancer cells. FOXD2-AS1 was upregulated in thyroid carcinoma
   tissues and cells. High expression of FOXD2-AS1 significantly correlated
   with clinical stage, recurrence of thyroid carcinoma. Silencing
   FOXD2-AS1 inhibited cancer stem cell-like phenotypes and attenuates the
   anoikis resistance in vitro. Downregulating FOXD2-AS1 represses the
   tumorigenesis of thyroid carcinoma cells in vivo. FOXD2-AS1 acts as a
   competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-7-5p, up-regulating the
   expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which further
   promotes the cancer stem cells features and anoikis resistance in
   thyroid cancer cells. Our findings indicate that FOXD2-AS1 functions as
   an oncogenic regulator in the development of thyroid cancer,
   contributing to early recurrence of thyroid cancer.

AB Background: With the rapid development of the high throughput detection
   techniques, tumor-related Omics data has become an important source for
   studying the mechanism of tumor progression including breast cancer, one
   of the major malignancies worldwide. A previous study has shown that the
   G2 and S phase-expressed-1 (GTSE1) can act as an oncogene in several
   human cancers. However, its functional roles in breast cancer remain
   elusive.
   Method: In this study, we analyzed breast cancer data downloaded from
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and other online database
   including the Oncomine, bc-GenExMiner and PROGgeneV2 database to
   identify the molecules contributing to the progression of breast cancer.
   The GTSE1 expression levels were investigated using qRT-PCR,
   immunoblotting and IHC. The biological function of GTSE1 in the growth,
   migration and invasion of breast cancer was examined in MDA-MB-231,
   MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cell lines. The in vitro cell proliferative,
   migratory and invasive abilities were evaluated by MTS, colony formation
   and transwell assay, respectively. The role of GTSE1 in the growth and
   metastasis of breast cancer were revealed by in vivo investigation using
   BALB/c nude mice.
   Results: We showed that the expression level of GTSE1 was upregulated in
   breast cancer specimens and cell lines, especially in triple negative
   breast cancer (TNBC) and p53 mutated breast cancer cell lines.
   Importantly, high GTSE1 expression was positively correlated with
   histological grade and poor survival. We demonstrated that GTSE1 could
   promote breast cancer cell growth by activating the AKT pathway and
   enhance metastasis by regulating the Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition
   (EMT) pathway. Furthermore, it could cause multidrug resistance in
   breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that GTSE1 could regulate
   the p53 function to alter the cell cycle distribution dependent on the
   mutation state of p53.
   Conclusion: Our results reveal that GTSE1 played a key role in the
   progression of breast cancer, indicating that GTSE1 could serve as a
   novel biomarker to aid in the assessment of the prognosis of breast
   cancer.

AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of brain cancer.
   Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy against glioblastoma depends on
   the effectiveness of loaded antigens. Sphere-inducing culture conditions
   are being studied by many as a potential antigen source. Here, we
   investigated two different in vitro conditions (spheroid culture versus
   adherent culture) in relation to DC immunotherapy: (1) We studied the
   specific spheroid-culture proteome and assessed the clinical importance
   of spheroid proteins. (2) We evaluated the immunogenicity of spheroid
   lysate - both compared to adherent conditions.
   METHODS: We used seven spheroid culture systems, three of them
   patient-derived. Stemness-related markers were studied in those three
   via immunofluorescence. Spheroid-specific protein expression was
   measured via quantitative proteomics. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   survival data was used to investigate the clinical impact of spheroid
   proteins. Immunogenicity of spheroid versus adherent cell lysate was
   explored in autologous ELISPOT systems (DCs and T cells from the three
   patients).
   RESULTS: (1) The differential proteome of spheroid versus adherent
   glioblastoma culture conditions could successfully be established. The
   top 10 identified spheroid-specific proteins were associated with
   significantly decreased overall survival (TCGA MIT/Harvard cohort;
   n = 350, P = 0.014). (2) In exploratory experiments, immunogenicity of
   spheroid lysate vis-a-vis interferon (IFN)gamma production was lower
   than that of adherent cell lysate (IFNgamma ELISPOT; P = 0.034).
   CONCLUSIONS: Spheroid culture proteins seem to represent
   survival-relevant targets, supporting the use of spheroid culture
   conditions as an antigen source for DC immunotherapy. However,
   immunogenicity enhancement should be considered for future research.
   Transferability of our findings in terms of clinical impact and
   regarding different spheroid-generation techniques needs further
   validation.

PY 2019
AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is the third most common reason of cancer-related
   deaths in men. Accumulating evidence has shown that dysregulation of
   long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is closely related to cancer initiation
   and development. Although large numbers of lncRNAs have been discovered,
   knowledge regarding their function and physiological/pathological
   significance remains limited. In this study, we aimed to reveal
   functional lncRNAs and identify prognosis-related RNAs in PCa by
   analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To achieve this, an
   lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network was constructed by weighted correlation
   network analysis. Additionally, a subnetwork was extracted from this
   weighted correlation network, and seven lncRNAs were identified as core
   nodes. Further Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that three lncRNAs
   (LINC00683, LINC00857, and FENDRR) were significantly downregulated in
   PCa samples, and there was a strong positive correlation with patient
   survival. Importantly, LINC00683 has not been fully reported as related
   with PCa. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis indicated that
   LINC00683 might be involved in cancer-related pathways such as the Wnt
   pathway. Based on the findings of this study, lncRNA LINC00683 is likely
   to provide a new diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for future
   PCa treatments.

AB Current studies suggest that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with
   prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In this paper, we
   aimed to identify a miRNAs signature to improve prognostic prediction
   for ccRCC patients. Using ccRCC RNA-Seq data of The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) database, we identified 177 differentially expressed miRNAs
   between ccRCC and paracancerous tissue. Then all the ccRCC tumor samples
   were divided into training set and validation set randomly. Three-miRNA
   signature including miR130b, miR-18a, and miR-223 were constructed by
   the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox
   regression model in training set. According to optimal cut-off value of
   three-miRNA signature risk score, all the patients could be classified
   into high-risk group and low-risk group significantly. Survival of
   patients was significantly different between two groups (hazard ratio,
   5.58, 95% confidence interval, 3.17-9.80; P<0.0001), and three-miRNA
   signature performed favorably prognostic and predictive accuracy. The
   results were further validated in the validation set and total set.
   Multivariate Cox regression analyses and subgroup analyses showed that
   three-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. Two
   nomograms that integrated three-miRNA signature and three
   clinicopathological risk factors were constructed to predict overall
   survival and disease-free survival after surgery for ccRCC patients.
   Functional enrichment analysis showed the possible roles of three-miRNA
   signature in some cancer-associated biological processes and pathways.
   In conclusion, we developed a novel three-miRNA signature that performed
   reliable prognostic for patient survival with ccRCC, it might facilitate
   ccRCC patients counseling and individualize management.

AB Purpose: Melanoma is the most aggressive and life-threatening cutaneous
   cancer. To explore new treatment strategies, it is essential to identify
   the mechanisms underlying melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis.
   Methods: In the current study, we demonstrated altered expression of
   long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in melanoma using
   data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Gene Ontology (GO),
   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were conducted. We also
   constructed a functional lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network and Kaplan-Meier
   analysis.
   Results: We identified 246 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 856
   DEmRNAs. A total of 184 DElncRNAs and 428 DEmRNAs were upregulated in
   metastatic melanoma, while all others were downregulated. Additionally,
   we investigated the co-expression pattern of 363 genes, among which 26
   upregulated lncRNAs, 9 downregulated lncRNAs, 49 upregulated mRNAs and
   151 downregulated mRNAs were identified as being co-expressed with
   others. Survival analysis suggested high levels of 14 lncRNAs and 10
   mRNAs may significantly increase or decrease overall survival. These
   differentially expressed genes are also potentially prognostic in
   melanoma.
   Conclusion: Our findings observe potential roles for lncRNAs and mRNAs
   during melanoma progression and provide candidate biomarkers for further

   is the bromodomain (BRD) family of proteins. In this work, we aimed to
   explore the expression of the BRD family at a transcriptomic level in
   breast cancer, and its association with patient survival. mRNA level
   data from normal breast and tumor tissues were extracted from public
   datasets. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify
   relevant biological functions. The KM Plotter Online tool was used to
   evaluate the relationship between the presence of different genes and
   patient clinical outcome. mRNA level data from HER2+ breast cancer
   patients sensible and resistant to trastuzumab were also evaluated. The
   BRD family was an enriched function. In HER2 positive tumors the
   combined analyses of BRD2, BAZ1A, TRIM33 and ZMYND8 showed a detrimental
   relapse free survival (RFS). Similarly, the combined analysis of BRD2,
   BAZ1A, PHIP, TRIM33, KMT2A, ASH1L, PBRM1, correlated with an extremely
   poor overall survival (OS). The prognosis was confirmed using an
   independent dataset from TCGA. Finally, no relation between expression
   of BRD genes and response to trastuzumab was observed in the HER2
   population. Upregulation of some BRD genes is associated with
   detrimental outcome in HER2 positive tumors, regardless trastuzumab
   treatment.

AB Background: Cancer cells evolve and constitute heterogeneous populations
   that fluctuate in space and time and are subjected to selection
   generating intratumor heterogeneity. This phenomenon is determined by
   the acquisition of genetic/epigenetic alterations and their selection
   over time which has clinical implications on drug resistance.
   Methods: DNA extracted from different tumor cell populations (breast
   carcinomas, cancer cell lines and cellular clones) were analyzed by
   MS-MLPA. Methylation profiles were used to generate a heterogeneity
   index to quantify the magnitude of epigenetic heterogeneity in these
   populations. Cellular clones were obtained from single cells derived of
   MDA-MB 231 cancer cell lines applying serial limiting dilution method
   and morphology was analyzed by optical microscopy and flow cytometry.
   Clones characteristics were examined through cellular proliferation,
   migration capacity and apoptosis. Heterogeneity index was also
   calculated from beta values derived from methylation profiles of TCGA
   tumors.
   Results: The study of methylation profiles of 23 fresh breast carcinomas
   revealed heterogeneous allele populations in these tumor pieces. With
   the purpose to measure the magnitude of epigenetic heterogeneity, we
   developed an heterogeneity index based on methylation information and
   observed that all tumors present their own heterogeneity level. Applying
   the index calculation in pure cancer cell populations such as cancer
   cell lines (MDA-MB 231, MCF-7, T47D, HeLa and K-562), we also observed
   epigenetic heterogeneity. In addition, we detected that clones obtained
   from the MDA-MB 231 cancer cell line generated their own new
   heterogeneity over time. Using TCGA tumors, we determined that the
   heterogeneity index correlated with prognostic and predictive factors
   like tumor size (p=0.0088), number of affected axillary nodes (p=0.007),
   estrogen receptor expression (p<0.0001) and HER2 positivity (p=0.0007).
   When we analyzed molecular subtypes we found that they presented
   different heterogeneity levels. Interestingly, we also observed that all
   mentioned tumor cell populations shared a similar Heterogeneity index
   (HI) mean.
   Conclusions: Our results show that each tumor presents a unique
   epigenetic heterogeneity level, which is associated with prognostic and
   predictive factors. We also observe that breast tumor subtypes differ in
   terms of epigenetic heterogeneity, which could serve as a new
   contribution to understand the different prognosis of these groups.

AB Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common cause of lung
   cancer-related deaths. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play an essential
   role in cancer development and progression. In this study, we identified
   PILAR1, a prognostic and overexpressed LncRNA, using multiple
   independent datasets of LUAD patients. Higher expression of PILAR1 was
   associated with survival in Dhanasekaran et al. (HR = 2.29, p-value =
   0.017), TCGA (HR = 1.51, p-value = 0.017) and KM plotter (HR = 2.67,
   p-value <= 0.0001) cohorts. Mutational landscape of LUAD showed that
   KEAP1 mutation was exclusively present in PILAR1 expressing samples.
   Further, knockdown of PILAR1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation,
   colony formation and migration of A549 cells. Importantly, inhibition of
   PILAR1 made the A549 cells more sensitive to etoposide. Furthermore,
   pathway analysis using differentially expressed genes in PILAR1
   knockdown cells compared to control cells identified enrichment of DNA
   repair genes suggesting towards the mechanism of PILAR1 mediated
   etoposide sensitivity. Taken together, we identified a prognostically
   robust LncRNA, PILAR1, which also regulates cell growth in lung cancer
   cells. PILAR1 expression identified a novel subtype of LUAD patients
   with the exclusive KEAP1 mutation.

AB BackgroundSingle Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in the genome has become
   crucial information for clinical use. For example, the targeted cancer
   therapy is primarily based on the information which clinically important
   SNPs are detectable from the tumor. Many hospitals have developed their
   own panels that include clinically important SNPs. The genome
   information exchange between the patient and the hospital has become
   more popular. However, the genome sequence information is innate and
   irreversible and thus its leakage has serious consequences. Therefore,
   protecting one's genome information is critical. On the other side,
   hospitals may need to protect their own panels. There is no known secure
   SNP panel scheme to protect both.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a
   secure SNP panel scheme using homomorphically encrypted K-mers without
   requiring SNP calling on the user side and without revealing the panel
   information to the user. Use of the powerful homomorphic encryption
   technique is desirable, but there is no known algorithm to efficiently
   align two homomorphically encrypted sequences. Thus, we designed and
   implemented a novel secure SNP panel scheme utilizing the
   computationally feasible equality test on two homomorphically encrypted
   K-mers. To make the scheme work correctly, in addition to SNPs in the
   panel, sequence variations at the population level should be addressed.
   We designed a concept of Point Deviation Tolerance (PDT) level to
   address the false positives and false negatives. Using the TCGA BRCA
   dataset, we demonstrated that our scheme works at the level of over a
   hundred thousand somatic mutations. In addition, we provide a
   computational guideline for the panel design, including the size of
   K-mer and the number of SNPs.ConclusionsThe proposed method is the first
   of its kind to protect both the user's sequence and the hospital's panel
   information using the powerful homomorphic encryption scheme. We
   demonstrated that the scheme works with a simulated dataset and the TCGA
   BRCA dataset. In this study, we have shown only the feasibility of the
   proposed scheme and much more efforts should be done to make the scheme
   usable for clinical use.

AB Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) acts as a tumor suppressor and

   Moreover, loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies showed that IRF6
   was negatively regulated by ZEB1 but positively regulated by ELF3.
   Additionally, transcription factor ZEB1 and ELF3 could directly bind on
   IRF6 promoter, which suggested that transcription factor IRF6 is
   transcriptionally regulated by ZEB1 and ELF3. Nevertheless, we found
   that IRF6 expression was negatively related to its promoter methylation
   in TCGA stomach cancer cohorts. The downregulation of IRF6 in GC might
   be due to the overexpression of ZEB1 and the DNA methylation of IRF6
   promoter.

AB Intestinal-type gastric cancer (GC) of the Lauren classification system
   has specific epidemiological characteristics and carcinogenesis
   patterns. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have prognostic significance, and some can
   be used as prognostic biomarkers in GC. In this study, we identified
   miR-1224 as a potential survival-related miRNA in intestinal-type GC
   patients by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TOGA) analysis. Using quantitative
   real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we showed that the relative expression of
   miR-1224 was significantly decreased in intestinal-type GC tissues
   compared to matched adjacent normal mucosa tissues (p < 0.01). We found
   that high miR-1224 expression was associated with no lymph-node
   metastasis (p < 0.05) and good prognosis (p = 0.028) in 90
   intestinal-type GC tissues. Transfection of intestinal-type GC cells
   with miR-1224 mimics showed that miR-1224 suppressed cell migration in
   vitro (wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay), whereas the
   transfection of cells with miR-1224 inhibitor promoted cell migration in
   vitro. miR-1224 also suppressed intestinal-type GC cell metastasis in a
   xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, bioinformatics, luciferase reporter,
   Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies demonstrated
   that miR-1224 directly bound to the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) gene,
   and downregulated its expression, which decreased STAT3 and NF-kappa B
   signaling and subsequent the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
   Repression of FAK is required for the miR-1224-mediated inhibition of
   cell migration in intestinal-type GC. The present study demonstrated
   that miR-1224 is downregulated in intestinal-type GC. miR-1224 inhibits
   the metastasis of intestinal-type GC by suppressing FAK-mediated
   activation of the STAT3 and NF-kappa B pathways, and subsequent EMT
   miR-1224 could represent an important prognostic factor in
   intestinal-type GC.

AB OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the world, and
   lung adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer subtype.
   Identification and determination of relevant prognostic markers are the
   key steps to personalized cancer management.
   METHOD: We collected the gene expression profiles from 265 tumor tissues
   of stage I patient from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Using
   Cox regression model, we evaluated the association between gene
   expression and the overall survival time of patients adjusting for
   gender and age at initial pathologic diagnosis.
   RESULTS: Age at initial pathologic diagnosis was identified to be
   associated with the survival, while gender was not. We identified that
   15 genes were significantly associated with overall survival time of
   patients (FDR < 0.1). The 15-mRNA signature- based risk score was
   helpful to distinguish patients of high-risk group from patients of
   low-risk group.
   CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal novel genes associated with lung
   adenocarcinoma survival and extend our understanding of how gene
   expression contributes to lung adenocarcinoma survival. These results
   are helpful for prediction of the prognosis and personalized cancer
   management.

AB BACKGROUND: Germline DNA copy number variation (CNV) is a ubiquitous
   source of genetic variation and remains largely unexplored in
   association with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk.
   METHODS: CNV was quantified in the DNA of approximately 3500 cases and
   controls genotyped with the Illumina 610k and HumanOmni2.5M arrays. We
   performed a genome-wide association study of common (>1%) CNV regions
   (CNVRs) with EOC and high-grade serous (HGSOC) risk and, using The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), performed in silico analyses of tumor-gene
   expression.
   RESULTS: Three CNVRs were associated (P<0.01) with EOC risk: two large
   (~100kb) regions within the 610k set and one small (<5kb) region with
   the higher resolution 2.5M data. Large CNVRs included a duplication at
   LILRA6 (OR=2.57, P=0.001) and a deletion at CYP2A7 (OR=1.90, P=0.007)
   that was strongly associated with HGSOC risk (OR=3.02, P=8.98x10-5).
   Somatic CYP2A7 alterations correlated with EGLN2 expression in tumors
   (P=2.94x10-47). An intronic ERBB4/HER4 deletion was associated with
   reduced EOC risk (OR=0.33, P=9.5x10-2) and somatic deletions correlated
   with ERBB4 downregulation (P=7.05x10-5). Five CNVRs were associated with
   HGSOC including two reduced-risk deletions: one at 1p36.33 (OR=0.28,
   P=0.001) that correlated with lower CDKIIA expression in TCGA tumors
   (P=2.7x10-7), and another at 8p21.2 (OR=0.52, P=0.002) that was present
   somatically where it correlated with lower GNRH1 expression
   (P=5.9x10-5).
   CONCLUSIONS: Though CNV appears to not contribute largely to EOC
   susceptibility, a number of low-to-common frequency variants may
   influence the risk of EOC and tumor gene expression.
   IMPACT: Further research on CNV and EOC susceptibility is warranted,
   particularly with CNVs estimated from high-density arrays.

AB Integrating protein-coding gene (PCG) with long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)
   expression profiles, our aim is to identify a multidimensional
   transcriptome model that can predict individual prognosis of patients
   with breast cancer (BRCA). After diverse bioinformatics and statistical
   analyses, we obtained gene expression profiles of 1,016 BRCA samples
   from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   database, and constructed a prognostic signature, which is composed of
   four PCGs (TFCP2, LRRC75B, PROSER2, and STOML1) and one lncRNA
   (AL355592.1). In the training set, the multidimensional transcriptome
   signature could part patients withBRCA into two groups with different
   survival, defined as high- and low-risk group by Kaplan-Meier (KM)
   analysis (p<0.001). In the other five validation datasets, the
   PCG-lncRNA signature showed a similar predictive performance in BRCA by
   KM (p<0.05). The prognostic independence for the PCG-lncRNA model was
   verified by the multivariable Cox regression analysis. Because
   Chi-squared test showed the signature was associated with lymph node
   metastasis status, stratification analysis found that it could further
   subdivide lymph node metastasis status more precisely in BRCA. The
   function analysis suggested that the genes from the signature were
   associated with immunity-related pathways. In summary, we constructed a
   PCG-lncRNA signature, which could accurately predict survival in
   patients with BRCA.

TI A synonymous VHL variant in exon 2 confers susceptibility to familial

SO The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism
DI 10.1210/jc.2019-00235
PD 2019-Apr-04
PY 2019
AB CONTEXT: von Hippel-Lindau disease, comprising renal cancer,
   hemangioblastoma and/or pheochromocytoma (PHEO) is caused by missense or
   truncating variants of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, which is involved
   in degradation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). However, the role of
   synonymous VHL variants in the disease is unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: We evaluated a synonymous VHL variant in patients with
   familial PHEO or VHL disease without a detectable pathogenic VHL
   mutation.
   DESIGN: We performed genetic and transcriptional analyses of leukocytes
   and/or tumors from affected and unaffected individuals and evaluated VHL
   splicing in existing cancer databases.
   RESULTS: We identified a synonymous VHL variant(c.414A>G, p.Pro138Pro)
   as the driver event in five independent individuals/families with PHEOs
   or VHL syndrome. This variant promotes exon 2 skipping and, hence,
   abolishes expression of the full-length VHL transcript. Exon 2 spans the
   HIF binding domain, required for HIF degradation by VHL. Accordingly,
   PHEOs carrying this variant display HIF hyperactivation typical of VHL
   loss. Moreover, other exon 2 VHL variants from the TCGA pan-cancer
   datasets are biased toward expression of a VHL transcript that excludes
   this exon, supporting a broader impact of this spliced variant.
   CONCLUSION: A recurrent synonymous VHL variant (c.414A>G, p.Pro138Pro)
   confers susceptibility to PHEO and VHL disease through splice
   disruption, leading to VHL dysfunction. This finding indicates that
   certain synonymous VHL variants may be clinically relevant and should be
   considered in genetic testing and surveillance settings. The observation
   that other coding VHL variants can exclude exon 2 suggests that
   dysregulated splicing may be an underappreciated mechanism in
   VHL-mediated tumorigenesis.

AB Background and Objective: As a common cancer type in women, cervical
   cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-associated
   mortalities word wide. Recent evidence has demonstrated the regulatory
   role of a large number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cervical
   cancer. Here, we aimed to identify new biomarkers that related with the
   recurrence through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.
   Methods: Firstly, we collected online lncRNA expression data of cervical
   cancer patients which were divided into training, validation, and test
   set. Then we developed a nine-lncRNA signature from training set by
   conducting LASSO Cox regression model along with 10-fold cross
   validation. The prognostic value of this risk score was validated in all
   the three sets using Kaplan-Meier analysis, C-index, time-dependent ROC
   curves and dynamic AUC. Biological function of these lncRNAs in cervical
   cancer cells were evaluated by performing gene ontology biological
   process enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling
   pathways analysis.
   Results: According to the results, a higher predict accuracy was
   observed in the nine-lncRNA signature than that of FIGO stage in all the
   three sets. Stratified analysis also demonstrated that the nine-lncRNA
   signature can predict the recurrence of cervical cancer within FIGO
   stage. The potential mechanisms underlying the nine-lncRNAs from the
   signature were also identified according to the gene enrichment
   analysis.
   Conclusion: In the present article, we provided a reliable prognostic
   tool to facilitate the individual management of patients with cervical
   cancer after treatment.

AB BackgroundUpregulation of SLC2A genes that encode glucose transporter
   (GLUT) protein is associated with poor prognosis in many cancers. In
   colorectal cancer, studies reporting the association between
   overexpression of GLUT and poor clinical outcomes were flawed by small
   sample sizes or subjective interpretation of immunohistochemical
   staining. Here, we analyzed mRNA expressions in all 14 SLC2A genes and
   evaluated the association with prognosis in colorectal cancer using data
   from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.MethodsIn the present
   study, we analyzed the expression of SLC2A genes in colorectal cancer
   and their association with prognosis using data obtained from the TCGA
   for the discovery sample, and a dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus
   for the validation sample.ResultsSLC2A3 was significantly associated
   with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in both the
   discovery sample (345 patients) and validation sample (501 patients).
   High SLC2A3 expression resulted in shorter OS and DFS. In multivariate
   analyses, high SLC2A3 levels predicted unfavorable OS (adjusted HR 1.95,
   95% CI 1.22-3.11; P=0.005) and were associated with poor DFS (adjusted
   HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.10-3.12; P=0.02). Similar results were found in the
   discovery set.ConclusionUpregulation of the SLC2A3 genes is associated
   with decreased OS and DFS in colorectal cancer patients. Therefore,
   assessment of SLC2A3 gene expression may useful for predicting prognosis
   in these patients.

AB BackgroundThe dynein axonemal heavy chain (DNAH) family of genes encode
   the dynein axonemal heavy chain, which is involved in cell motility.
   Genomic variations of DNAH family members have been frequently reported
   in diverse kinds of malignant tumors. In this study, we analyzed the
   genomic database to evaluate the mutation status of DNAH genes in
   gastric adenocarcinoma and further identified the significance of mutant
   DNAH genes as effective molecular biomarkers for predicting chemotherapy
   response in gastric cancer patients.MethodsWe analyzed the clinical and
   genomic data of gastric cancer patients published in The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) project. Data on chemotherapy response, overall survival
   (OS) and chemotherapy-free survival were retrieved. Then, we verified
   the results via targeted sequencing of gastric cancer patients with
   similar clinical characteristics but different chemotherapeutic
   outcomes.ResultsIn total, 132 gastric adenocarcinoma patients undergoing
   chemotherapy treatment from TCGA were included in our study. Somatic
   mutations in all 13 members of the DNAH family of genes were associated
   with different chemotherapy responses. Compared with patients with
   wild-type DNAH genes (n=59), a significantly higher proportion of those
   with mutations in DNAH genes (n=73) (55.9% vs 80.8%) responded to
   chemotherapy (P=0.002). Moreover, DNAH mutations were correlated with
   significantly better OS (P=0.027), chemotherapy-free survival (P=0.027),
   fluoropyrimidine-free survival (P=0.048) and platinum-free survival
   (P=0.014). DNAH mutation status was an independent risk factor for OS
   (P=0.015), chemotherapy-free survival (P=0.015) and platinum-free
   survival (P=0.011). We identified somatic mutations in 27 (42.2%) of the
   64 stage III gastric adenocarcinoma patients receiving
   fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy by targeted exon sequencing with
   strict screening conditions. In our own cohort, a significantly higher
   proportion of patients (n=32) with DNAH mutations than patients with
   wild-type DNAH genes (n=32) had a good prognosis (OS>48months) (70.4% vs
   35.1%) (P=0.005).ConclusionsDynein axonemal heavy chain gene mutations
   contribute positively to chemotherapy sensitivity in gastric cancer
   patients.

AB Introduction: Anticancer chemotherapy often faces the problem of
   intrinsic or acquired drug refractoriness due in part to efficient
   mechanisms of defense present or developed, respectively, in cancer
   cells. Owing to their polarity and/or high molecular weight, many
   cytostatic agents cannot freely cross the plasma membrane by simple
   diffusion and hence depend on SLC proteins to enter cancer cells. The
   downregulation of these transporters and the appearance of either
   inactivating mutations or aberrant splicing, hamper the possibility of
   anticancer drugs to interact with their intracellular targets. Areas
   covered: In addition to specific literature, we have revised Gene
   database of the NCBI PubMed resources and information publicly available
   at NIH 'The Cancer Genome Atlas' (TCGA) (update November 2018) to
   evaluate the relationship between the profile of expression of SLC
   transporters playing a major role in the transportome and accounting for
   drug uptake, in healthy and tumor tissue, and their ability to recognize
   as substrate several antitumor drugs frequently used in the treatment of
   different types of cancer, which could affect the overall response to
   chemotherapy based on regimens including these drugs. Expert commentary:
   Changes in the transportome may affect the overall response to
   chemotherapy based on drugs taken up by SLC transporters.

AB CONTEXT: Metabolic reprogramming is a common feature of tumorigenesis.
   It remains unknown concerning expression pattern of
   metabolism-associated genes in dedifferentiated thyroid cancer (DDTC).
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify a useful signature to indicate
   dedifferentiation of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).
   DESIGN AND SETTING: We utilized one discovery and two validation cohorts
   to screen out aberrant metabolic genes in DDTC, and further used The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort to search for independent risk factors
   for the low-differentiated phenotype of PTC as a signature of
   dedifferentiation. The prediction of the signature for DDTC was
   validated in the TCGA cohort and the combined Gene Expression Omnibus
   (GEO) cohort. We also analyzed the correlations of the signature risk
   score with clinicopathological features of PTC. Gene set enrichment
   analyses were performed in the TCGA cohort.
   RESULTS: Significant enrichment of metabolic pathways correlated with
   differentiation status of PTC. A signature of metabolic genes including
   LPCAT2, ACOT7, HSD17B8, PDE8B and ST3GAL1 was discovered and validated
   across three cohorts. The signature was not only predictive of DDTC but
   also significantly associated with BRAFV600E mutation (p<0.001), T3/T4
   stage (p<0.001), extrathyroidal extension (p<0.001), lymph node
   metastasis (p<0.001) and III/IV stage (p<0.001) in PTC. Downregulations
   of LPCAT2 expression (p=0.009) and ST3GAL1 expression (p=0.005)
   increased risks of decreased disease-free survival for patients.
   Furthermore, the signature was implicated in a number of oncogenic
   biological pathways.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest metabolic deregulations mediate
   dedifferentiation of PTC, and the metabolic gene signature can be used
   as a biomarker for DDTC.

AB Accumulative reports have documented the critical functions of long
   non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the progression of malignant tumors,
   including bladder cancer (BCa). LncRNA ARAP1-AS1 was chosen to be the
   object of this study due to it was significantly upregulated in the BCa
   samples of TCGA database. qRT-PCR further validated the dysregulation of
   ARAP1-AS1 in 88 pairs of BCa tissues and six BCa cells. Kaplan Meier
   analysis was utilized to analyze the prognostic value of ARAP1-AS1 for
   patients with BCa. To evaluate the oncogenic property of ARAP1-AS1 in
   bladder cancer, loss-of-function assays were conducted in two BCa cells
   in which ARAP1-AS1 was expressed highest. Mechanically, ARAP1-AS1 was
   enriched in the cytoplasm of BCa cells, suggesting that ARAP1-AS1 might
   act as a ceRNA to regulate gene expression and biological processes in
   bladder cancer. It was certified that ARAP1-AS1 can bind with
   miR-4735-3p in BCa cells. Moreover, functional assays supported the
   hypothesis that miR-4735-3p is a tumor suppressor in BCa. Additionally,
   NOTCH2 mRNA could be targeted by miR-4735-3p in BCa cells. The results
   of all mechanism experiments indicated that ARAP1-AS1 regulated
   miR-4735-3p/NOTCH2 axis in BCa by acting as a ceRNA. All our research

AB DUSP6/MKP3 is a dual-specific phosphatase that regulates extracellular
   regulated kinase ERK1/2 and ERK5 activity, with an increasingly
   recognized role as tumor suppressor. In silico studies from Gene
   expression Omnibus (GEO) and Cancer Genome atlas (TCGA) databases reveal
   poor prognosis in those Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with
   low expression levels of DUSP6. In agreement with these data, here we
   show that DUSP6 plays a major role in the regulation of cell migration,
   motility and tumor growth. We have found upregulation in the expression
   of several genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
   in NSCLC-DUSP6 depleted cells. Data obtained in RNA-seq studies carried
   out in DUSP6 depleted cells identified EGFR, TGF- and WNT signaling
   pathways and several genes such as VAV3, RUNXR2, LEF1, FGFR2 whose
   expression is upregulated in these cells and therefore affecting
   cellular functions such as integrin mediated cell adhesion, focal
   adhesion and motility. Furthermore, EGF signaling pathway is activated
   via ERK5 and not ERK1/2 and TGF- via SMAD2/3 in DUSP6 depleted cells. In
   summary DUSP6 is a tumor suppressor in NSCLC and re-establishment of its
   expression may be a potential strategy to revert poor outcome in NSCLC
   patients.

AB Since the advent of cetuximab, clinical cancer treatment has evolved
   from the standard, relatively nonspecific chemo- and radiotherapy with
   significant cytotoxic side effects towards immunotherapeutic approaches
   with selective, target-mechanism-based effects. Antibody therapies as
   the most successful form of cancer immunotherapy led to approved
   treatments for specific cancer types with increased patient survival.
   Thus, the identification of tumor antigens with high immunogenicity is
   in central focus now. In this study, we applied computational methods to
   comprehensively discover overexpressed molecular targets with high
   therapeutic relevance for clinical, immunotherapeutic cancer treatment
   in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). By actively modeling potential
   negative side effects utilizing expression data of 29 different, normal
   human tissues, we were able to develop a highly-specific coverage of
   TNBC patients with RNA targets. We identified here more than 400
   potential tumor-specific antigens suitable for targeted therapy,
   including several already identified as potential targets for TNBC and
   other solid tumors. A specific cocktail of MAGEB4, CT83, TLX3, ACTL8,
   PRDM13 achieved almost 94% patient coverage in TNBC. Overall, these
   results show that our approach can identify and prioritize TNBC targets
   suitable for targeted therapy. Therefore, our method has the potential
   to lead to new and more effective immunotherapeutic cancer treatment.

AB BackgroundInvasion and metastasis are determinant events in the
   prognosis of Colorectal cancer (CRC), a common neoplasm worldwide. An
   important factor for metastasis is the acquired capacity of the cell to
   proliferate and invade adjacent tissues. In this paper, we explored the
   role of micro-RNA-26a in the regulation of proliferation and migration
   in CRC-derived cells through the negative regulation of PTEN, a key
   negative regulator of the AKT pathway.MethodsExpression levels of PTEN
   and mir-26a were surveyed in normal and CRC-derived cell lines; paraffin
   embedded human tissues, TCGA CRC expression data and a Balb/c mice
   orthotopic induced CRC model. CRC was induced by an initial
   intraperitoneal dose of the colonic carcinogen Azoxymethane followed by
   inflammatory promoter Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt. Luciferase assays
   provide information about miR-26a-PTEN 3UTR interaction. Proliferation
   and migration by real time cell analysis and wound-healing functional
   analyses were performed to assess the participation of mir-26a on
   important hallmarks of CRC and its regulation on the PTEN gene.ResultsWe
   observed a negative correlation between PTEN and mir-26a expression in
   cell lines, human tissues, TCGA data, and tissues derived from the CRC
   mouse model. Moreover, we showed that negative regulation of PTEN
   exerted by miR-26a affected AKT phosphorylation levels directly.
   Functional assays showed that mir-26a directly down-regulates PTEN, and
   that mir-26a over-expressing cells had higher proliferation and
   migration rates.ConclusionsAll this data proposes an important role of
   mir-26a as an oncomir in the progression and invasion of CRC. Our data
   suggested that mir-26a could be used as a biomarker of tumor development
   in CRC patients, however more studies must be conducted to establish its
   clinical role.

AB Background: LncRNA MIR4435-2HG is observed in a variety of cancers,
   while its role in colorectal cancer is unknown. We aimed to demonstrate
   the relationship between MIR4435-2HG and colorectal cancer based on The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
   Materials and Methods: Patients with colorectal cancer were collected
   from TCGA. We compared the expression of MIR4435-2HG in colorectal
   cancer and normal tissues with Wilcoxon rank sum test, and logistic
   regression was used to evaluate the relationship between MIR4435-2HG and
   clinicopathological characters. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier and Cox
   regression was performed to evaluate the correlation between MIR4435-2HG
   and survival rate. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was also
   conducted to annotate biological function of MIR4435-2HG.
   Results: MIR4435-2HG level was elevated in colorectal cancer tissues.
   Increased level of MIR4435-2HG was significantly correlated with TNM
   stage (OR = 1.66 for T1/T2 vs. T3/T4; OR = 1.68 for N0 vs. N1/N2), stage
   (OR = 1.66 for stage 1/2 vs. stage 3/4), and carcinoembryonic antigen
   level before treatment (OR = 1.70 for <5 vs. >= 5) (all P-value <0.05).
   High MIR4435-2HG expression had a poorer progression-free survival (p =
   0.048), and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.028), which were validated in
   the GSE92921 and GSE29621 datasets. MIR4435-2HG expression (P = 0.040,
   HR = 1.955 (95% CI [1.031-3.710])) was independently correlated with OS.
   GSEA demonstrated that the P38/MAPK pathway, the VEGF pathway, the cell
   adhesion molecules cams, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the
   cell surface interactions at the vascular wall, and integrin cell
   surface interactions were differentially enriched in MIR4435-2HG high
   expression phenotype.
   Conclusions: Increased MIR4435-2HG might be a potential biomarker for
   the diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer. Moreover, MIR4435-2HG
   might participate in the development of colorectal cancer via the
   P38/MAPK and VEGF pathway.

AB BackgroundPapillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most frequent type of
   thyroid malignancy. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms
   whereby long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with PTC
   pathogenesis.MethodsMicroarray analysis was used to determine
   differentially expressed lncRNAs between paired PTC tissues and normal
   adjacent thyroid tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR was used for validation in
   86 PTC cases. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection assays were
   then performed to assess how a novel lncRNA affected key proliferation
   and cell death pathways in IHH4 PTC cells.ResultsWe identified 1878
   differentially expressed lncRNAs versus matched control samples (fold
   change 2.0, P<0.05), of which 429 were upregulated and 1449 were
   downregulated. ENST00000539653.1 (ENS-653), one of the top hits in this
   microarray, was selected for further study. Higher ENS-653 expression
   was observed in PTC tissue samples versus adjacent normal tissues, and
   was associated with a larger tumor size and a more advanced clinical
   stage. In the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PTC cohort, higher ENS-653
   expression was correlated with more frequent BRAF (V600E) mutation and
   poorer disease-free survival. Furthermore, ENS-653 downregulation
   reduced the proliferation of PTC cells and led to G1-S arrest, but had
   no impact on apoptosis. ENS-653 downregulation also inactivated ERK1/2
   and ERK5, causing partial MAPK cascade suppression.ConclusionENS-653
   exhibits oncogenic properties in PTC, and could be a diagnostic and/or
   prognostic PTC biomarker, in addition to possibly being a future target
   for therapy.

AB Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly heterogeneous and has a
   poor prognosis. It is therefore important to identify the underlying
   molecular mechanisms in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
   Although emerging research has revealed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as
   vital to carcinogenesis and cancer progression, their functional
   involvement in TNBC has not been well defined. In this study, we
   utilized the TCGA database and analysed clinical samples to show that
   the long non-coding antisense transcript of NAMPT, NAMPT-AS, is
   upregulated in TNBC and is associated with poor prognosis, lymph node
   involvement, metastasis, and advanced stage. NAMPT-AS was co-transcribed
   with NAMPT from a bidirectional promoter, where the distributions of
   H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac chromatin modifications were enriched based on
   ENCODE and FANTOM5, suggesting the potential enhancer-RNA
   characteristics of NAMPT-AS. NAMPT-AS epigenetically regulated the
   expression of NAMPT in two divergent ways: NAMPT-AS recruited POU2F2 to
   activate the transcription of NAMPT, and NAMPT-AS acted as a competing
   endogenous RNA to rescue NAMPT degradation from miR-548b-3p.
   NAMPT-AS/NAMPT promoted tumor progression and regulated autophagy
   through the mTOR pathway in vitro and in vivo. In a cohort of 480 breast
   cancer patients, NAMPT was associated with breast cancer-specific
   survival and overall survival. These results demonstrate that NAMPT-AS
   is an oncogenic lncRNA in TNBC that epigenetically activates NAMPT to
   promote tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, these data
   identify NAMPT-AS/NAMPT as promising therapeutic targets in TNBC
   patients.

AB Purpose: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy induces durable tumor
   regressions in a minority of patients with cancer. In this study, we
   aimed to identify kinase inhibitors that were capable of increasing the
   antimelanoma immunity.Experimental Design: Flow cytometry-based
   screening was performed to identify kinase inhibitors that can block the
   IFNgamma-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells. The pharmacologic
   activities of regorafenib alone or in combination with immunotherapy in
   vitro and in vivo were determined. The mechanisms of regorafenib were
   explored and analyzed in melanoma patients treated with or without
   anti-PD-1 using The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) datasets.Result: Through screening of a kinase inhibitor
   library, we found approximately 20 agents that caused more than half
   reduction of cell surface PD-L1 level, and regorafenib was one of the
   most potent agents. Furthermore, our results showed that regorafenib, in
   vitro and in vivo, strongly promoted the antitumor efficacy when
   combined with IFNgamma or ICB. By targeting the RET-Src axis,
   regorafenib potently inhibited JAK1/2-STAT1 and MAPK signaling and
   subsequently attenuated the IFNgamma-induced PD-L1 and IDO1 expression
   without affecting MHC-I expression much. Moreover, RET and Src co-high
   expression was an independent unfavorable prognosis factor in melanoma
   patients with or without ICB through inhibiting the antitumor immune
   response.Conclusions: Our data unveiled a new mechanism of alleviating
   IFNgamma-induced PD-L1 and IDO1 expression and provided a rationale to
   explore a novel combination of ICB with regorafenib clinically,
   especially in melanoma with RET/Src axis activation.

AB Background: The complexity of breast cancer at the clinical,
   morphological and genomic levels has been extensively studied in the
   western population. However, the mutational genomic profiles in Chinese
   breast cancer patients have not been explored in any detail.
   Methods: We performed targeted sequencing using a panel consisting of 33
   breast cancer-related genes to investigate the genomic landscape of 304
   consecutive treatment-naive Chinese breast cancer patients at Guangdong
   Provincial People's Hospital (GDPH), and further compared the results to
   those in 453 of Caucasian breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA).
   Results: The most frequently mutated gene was TP53 (45%), followed by
   PIK3CA (44%), GATA3 (18%), MAP3K1 (10%), whereas the copy-number
   amplifications were frequently observed in genes of ERBB2 (24%), MYC
   (23%), FGFR1 (13%) and CCND1 (10%). Among the 8 most frequently mutated
   or amplified genes, at least one driver was identifiable in 87.5%
   (n=267) of our GDPH cohort, revealing the significant contribution of
   these known driver genes in the development of Chinese breast cancer.
   Compared to TCGA data, the median age at diagnosis in our cohort was
   significantly younger (48 vs. 58 years; P<0.001), while the distribution
   of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human
   epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) statuses were similar. The
   largest difference occurred in HR+/HER2- subtype, where 8 of the 10
   driver genes compared had statistically significant differences in their
   frequency, while there were differences in 2 of 10 driver genes among
   the TNBC and HR+/HER2+ group, but none in the HR-/HER2+ patients in our
   cohort compared to the TCGA data. Collectively, the most significant
   genomic difference was a significantly higher prevalence for TP53 and
   AKT1 in Chinese patients. Additionally, more than half of TP53-mutation
   HR+/HER2- Chinese patients (similar to 60%) are likely to harbor more
   severe mutations in TP53, such as nonsense, indels, and splicing
   mutations.
   Conclusions: We elucidated the mutational landscape of cancer genes in
   Chinese breast cancer and further identified significant genomic
   differences between Asian and Caucasian patients. These results should
   improve our understanding of pathogenesis and/or metastatic behavior of
   breast cancer across races/ethnicities, including a better selection of
   targeted therapies.

AB Objective To investigate the mechanism of serine hydroxymethyl
   transferase 2 (SHMT2) inducing autophagy and promoting chemotherapy
   resistance in colon cancer cells. Methods TCGA database and real-time
   quantitative PCR were used to analyze the level of SHMT2 mRNA in colon
   cancer tissues. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used
   to detect the expression and distribution of SHMT2 in colon cancer
   tissues. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the SHMT2 protein
   levels of SW480, SW620, HCT116, CACO2, RKO, HCT8, HT15 and HT29 cells.
   After over-expression of SHMT2 in CACO2 colon cancer cells, MTT assay
   was used to detect cell viability, and annexin V-FITC/PI double labeling
   was used to detect the apoptosis of colon cancer cells induced by
   5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). The autophagosomes of colon cancer cells were
   observed by transmission electron microscopy. The protein levels of LC3
   II/I, P62, cleaved PARP (c-PARP), and cleaved caspase-3 (c-caspase-3)
   were examined by Western blot analysis. Signaling Phospho-Antibody Array
   and Western blot analysis were applied to analyze the phosphorylation
   level of AMPK/mTOR. Results SHMT2 was highly expressed in colon cancer
   tissues and cells. Over-expression of SHMT2 significantly increased cell
   viability and the ratio of LC3 II/ LC3 I. It was found that the
   phosphorylation level of AMPK was raised and the phosphorylation level
   of mTOR was reduced after the over-expression of SHMT2. Conclusion SHMT2
   may induce autophagy by promoting AMPK phosphorylation and directly or
   indirectly inhibiting mTOR activity, thus leading to
   chemotherapy-induced apoptosis tolerance and resistance to
   chemotherapeutics.

AB Previous studies have revealed that dysregulation of long non-coding
   RNAs (lncRNAs) can facilitate carcinogenesis. This study aims to
   investigate the biological role of a certain lncRNA in cutaneous
   squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). According to the data of TCGA database,
   high expression of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1048
   (LINC01048) is an unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with CSCC.
   Therefore, we further detected the expression pattern of LINC01048 in
   CSCC tissues. Obviously, LINC01048 was expressed higher in the CSCC
   tissues and recurrence tissues compared with that in adjacent normal
   tissues and non-recurrence tissues. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis
   revealed the negative correlation between LINC01048 expression and the
   overall survival and disease-free survival of CSCC patients.
   Subsequently, functional assays were conducted to prove the inhibitory
   effect of silenced LINC01048 on the proliferation and apoptosis of CSCC
   cells. Mechanistically, LINC01048 was proved to be transcriptionally
   activated by USF1. Pathway analysis and western blot assay showed that
   knockdown of LINC01048 led to the activation of Hippo pathway. Moreover,
   YAP1, a Hippo pathway factor, was positively regulated by LINC01048.
   Further mechanism investigation revealed that LINC01048 increased the
   binding of TAF15 to YAP1 promoter to transcriptionally activate YAP1 in
   CSCC cells. Finally, rescue assays demonstrated that YAP1 involved in
   LINC01048-mediated CSCC cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion,
   USF1-induced upregulation of LINC01048 promoted CSCC by interacting with
   TAF15 to upregulate YAP1.

AB Nucleoside analog, cytarabine (ara-C) is the mainstay of acute myeloid
   leukemia (AML) chemotherapy. Cytarabine and other nucleoside analogs
   require activation to the triphosphate form (ara-CTP). Intracellular
   ara-CTP levels demonstrate significant inter-patient variation and have
   been related to therapeutic response in AML patients. Inter-patient
   variation in expression levels of drug transporters or enzymes involved
   in the activation or inactivation of cytarabine and other analogs is a
   prime mechanism contributing to development of drug resistance. Since
   microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to regulate gene-expression, the aim of
   this study was to identify miRNAs involved in regulation of messenger
   RNA expression levels of cytarabine pathway genes. We evaluated miRNA
   and gene-expression levels of cytarabine metabolic pathway genes in 8
   AML cell lines and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data base. Using
   correlation analysis and functional validation experiments, our data
   demonstrates that miR-34a-5p and miR-24-3p regulate DCK, an enzyme
   involved in activation of cytarabine and DCTD, an enzyme involved in
   metabolic inactivation of cytarabine expression, respectively. Further
   our results from gel shift assays confirmed binding of these mRNA-miRNA
   pairs. Our results show miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression
   levels of nucleoside metabolic pathway genes can impact interindividual
   variation in expression levels which in turn may influence treatment
   outcomes.

AB The yolk is the main energy source for eggs and marine fish larvae.
   Temperature is a key factor in determining the efficiency of yolk
   conversion into body tissues, which can affect the size larvae at first
   feeding. In this work, the effect of different temperatures on the yolk
   sac consumption and oil droplet by the spotted rose snapper, Lutjanus
   guttatus was evaluated, in order to determine the adequate culture
   temperature during the first days after hatch. The fertilized eggs were
   placed in 20 L plastic tanks at different temperatures (22, 25, 28 and
   31 degrees C) with three replicates per treatment. The time and
   percentage of hatching, larvae total length, yolk consumption (TCV) and
   oil droplet (TCGA) rates at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after hatching (HDE) were
   determined. Eggs incubated at 22 degrees C did not hatch, while hatching
   time in eggs incubated at 31 degrees C decreased significantly. No
   differences were observed in hatching percentage between treatments of
   temperature. Larvae reared at 31 degrees C obtained the higher length
   value than those reared at 25 degrees C at 0 and 24 HDE. The yolk and
   oil droplet were consumed faster by larvae reared at 31 degrees C at 0
   and 24 HDE. Total mortality was registered for larvae reared at 25 and
   31 degrees C at 48 and 72 HDE, respectively. The optimal temperature for
   egg incubation and newly-hatched L. guttatus larvae was 28 degrees C,
   which would favorably impel the consumption of energy reserves for its
   growth and survival.

AB Background Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most biologically aggressive
   subtype of gliomas with an average survival of 10 to 12 months.
   Considering that the overall survival (OS) of each GBM patient is a key
   factor in the treatment of individuals, it is meaningful to predict the
   survival probability for GBM patients newly diagnosed in clinical
   practice. Material and Methods Using the TCGA dataset and two
   independent GEO datasets, we identified genes that are associated with
   the OS and differentially expressed between GBM tissues and the adjacent
   normal tissues. A robust likelihood-based survival modeling approach was
   applied to select the best genes for modeling. After the prognostic
   nomogram was generated, an independent dataset on different platform was
   used to evaluate its effectiveness. Results We identified 168
   differentially expressed genes associated with the OS. Five of these
   genes were selected to generate a gene prognostic nomogram. The external
   validation demonstrated that 5-gene prognostic nomogram has the
   capability of predicting the OS of GBM patients. Conclusion We developed
   a novel and convenient prognostic tool based on five genes that
   exhibited clinical value in predicting the survival probability for
   newly diagnosed GBM patients, and all of these five genes could
   represent potential target genes for the treatment of GBM. The
   development of this model will provide a good reference for cancer
   researchers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Increasing studies reported that the serum- and
   glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (SGKs) contributed to the tumorigenesis
   of various cancer. In this article, we are aiming to explore the
   function of SGK2 in renal cell cancer (RCC).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, the SGK2 expression was quantified
   by Western blot (WB) in multiple RCC cell lines. And in vitro SGK2
   knockdown and overexpression experiments were also performed. In
   addition, molecular function analysis was performed using FunRich
   software V3. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was retrieved to
   verify the association between the SGK2 expression and the prognosis of
   RCC patients.
   RESULTS: We found that SGK2 was up-regulated in RCC tissues compared
   with adjacent normal tissues, and the SGK2 expression also increased in
   various RCC cell lines compared to that in the normal epithelial cell
   line HK-2. Meanwhile, the SGK2 expression was significantly associated
   with the survival rate of RCC patients. Functional experiments showed
   that silencing SGK2 expression inhibited RCC cells proliferation,
   migration, colony formation and invasion abilities in vitro, whereas
   opposite results were uncovered after overexpressing SGK2 in RCC cells.
   Furthermore, functional analyses showed that SGK2 related genes were
   associated with protein serine/threonine kinase activity, guanosine
   triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor
   activity, and motor activity. Protein interaction analysis identified
   that growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), one of the most
   important upstream components in the growth factor signaling pathway,
   was significantly enriched in SGK2 related genes. In addition, the WB
   assay validated that SGK2 could promote the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2
   and AKT.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that SGK2 promoted RCC progression by
   mediating the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases
   (ERK) 1/2 and Protein kinase B (AKT/PKB), indicating that SGK2 might
   serve as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for renal
   cancer patients.

AB MicroRNA regulation is crucial for gene expression and cell functions.
   It has been linked to tumorigenesis, development and metastasis in
   colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, the let-7 family has been identified
   as a tumor suppressor in different types of cancers. However, the
   function of the let-7 family in CRC metastasis has not been fully
   investigated. Here, we focused on analyzing the role of let-7g in CRC.
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) genomic datasets of CRC and detailed data
   from a Taiwanese CRC cohort were applied to study the expression pattern
   of let-7g. In addition, in vitro as well as in vivo studies have been
   performed to uncover the effects of let-7g on CRC. We found that the
   expression of let-7g was significantly lower in CRC specimens. Our
   results further supported the inhibitory effects of let-7g on CRC cell
   migration, invasion and extracellular calcium influx through
   store-operated calcium channels. We report a critical role for let-7g in
   the pathogenesis of CRC and suggest let-7g as a potential therapeutic
   target for CRC treatment.

AB The aim of this study was to identify relevant biomarkers for the

   mutation and 1p19q deletion. Gene expression profiling was performed
   using the TaqMan Low Density Array and hierarchical clustering using 96
   selected genes in 64 patients with newly diagnosed glioma. The
   expression dataset was validated on a large independent cohort from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A differential expression panel of
   26 genes discriminated two prognostic groups regardless of grade and
   molecular groups of tumors: Patients having a poor prognosis with a
   median overall survival (OS) of 23.0 +/- 9.6 months (group A) and
   patients having a good prognosis with a median OS of 115.0 +/- 6.6
   months (group B) (p = 0.007). Hierarchical clustering of the glioma TCGA
   cohort supported the prognostic value of these 26 genes (p < 0.0001).
   Among these genes, CHI3L1 and NTRK2 were identified as factors that can
   be associated with IDH status and 1p/19q co-deletion to distinguish
   between prognostic groups of glioma from the TCGA cohort. Therefore,
   CHI3L1 associated with NTRK2 seemed to be able to provide new
   information on glioma prognosis.

AB It is well-known that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is
   critical for breast cancer (BC) development and progression. Several
   studies have revealed the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS)
   in cancer. In this study, we investigated the expression level of
   Proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 3 (PSMD3) in BC using BC cell lines,
   human BC tissue samples, Oncomine, and TCGA databases and studied the
   PSMD3-HER2 protein interaction. PSMD3 was upregulated in BC,
   particularly in the HER2+ subtype. PSMD3 immunostaining was detected in
   the cytoplasm and nucleus of BC tumor tissues. Strong interaction
   between PSMD3 and HER2 at the protein level was observed. Knockdown of
   PSMD3 significantly impaired the stability of HER2, inhibited BC cell
   proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell apoptosis.
   Ubiquitination process was strongly enhanced after knockdown of PSMD3 in
   association with decreased HER2 level. Accumulation and Localization of
   LAMP-1 in the cell membrane with decreased HER2 immunostaining was
   observed after knockdown of PSMD3. High expression level of PSMD3 was
   associated with HER2 expression (p < 0.001), tumor size (p < 0.001), and
   clinical stage (p = 0.036). High expression level of PSMD3 predicted a
   short overall survival (OS), particularly for HER2+. Overall, we provide
   a novel function for PSMD3 in stabilizing HER2 from degradation in HER2+
   BC, which suggests that PSMD3 is a novel target for HER2+ BC.

   Ca2+-dependent channels are now considered key regulators of tumor
   progression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of

   (KCa) with CRC using the transcriptional profile of their genes.
   Methods: We selected a total of 35 genes covering KCa channels KCNN1-4,
   KCNMA1 and their subunits KCNMB1-4, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium
   sensors STIM1 and STIM2, Ca2+ channels ORAI1-3 and the family of cation
   channels TRP (TRPC1-7, TRPA1, TRPV1/2,4-6 and TRPM1-8). We analyzed
   their expression in two public CRC datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) and GSE39582. Results: KCNN4 and TRPM2 were induced while KCNMA1
   and TRPM6 were downregulated in tumor tissues comparing to normal
   tissues. In proximal tumors, STIM2 and KCNN2 were upregulated while
   ORAI2 and TRPM6 were downregulated. ORAI1 decreased in lymph node
   metastatic tumors. TRPC1 and ORAI3 predicted poor prognosis in CRC
   patients. Moreover, we found that ORAI3/ORAI1 ratio is increased in CRC
   progression and predicted poor prognosis. Conclusions: KCa and Ca2+
   channels could be important contributors to CRC initiation and
   progression. Our results provide new insights on KCa and Ca2+ channels
   remodeling in CRC.

AB Artificial intelligence-based unsupervised deep learning (DL) is widely
   used to mine multimodal big data. However, there are few applications of
   this technology to cancer genomics. We aim to develop DL models to
   extract deep features from the breast cancer gene expression data and
   copy number alteration (CNA) data separately and jointly. We hypothesize
   that the deep features are associated with patients' clinical
   characteristics and outcomes. Two unsupervised denoising autoencoders
   (DAs) were developed to extract deep features from TCGA (The Cancer
   Genome Atlas) breast cancer gene expression and CNA data separately and
   jointly. A heat map was used to view and cluster patients into subgroups
   based on these DL features. Fisher's exact test and Pearson' Chi-square
   test were applied to test the associations of patients' groups and
   clinical information. Survival differences between the groups were
   evaluated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. Associations between each of the
   features and patient's overall survival were assessed using Cox's
   proportional hazards (COX-PH) model and a risk score for each feature
   set from the different omics data sets was generated from the survival
   regression coefficients. The risk scores for each feature set were
   binarized into high- and low-risk patient groups to evaluate survival
   differences using KM curves. Furthermore, the risk scores were traced
   back to their gene level DAs weights so that the three gene lists for
   each of the genomic data points were generated to perform gene set
   enrichment analysis. Patients were clustered into two groups based on
   concatenated features from the gene expression and CNA data and these
   two groups showed different overall survival rates (p-value = 0.049) and
   different ER (Estrogen receptor) statuses (p-value = 0.002, OR (odds
   ratio) = 0.626). All the risk scores from the gene expression and CNA
   data and their concatenated one were significantly associated with
   breast cancer survival. The patients with the high-risk group were
   significantly associated with patients' worse outcomes (p-values
   0.0023). The concatenated risk score was enriched by the AMP-activated
   protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, the regulation of DNA-templated
   transcription, the regulation of nucleic acid-templated transcription,
   the regulation of apoptotic process, the positive regulation of gene
   expression, the positive regulation of cell proliferation, heart
   morphogenesis, the regulation of cellular macromolecule biosynthetic
   process, with FDR (false discovery rate) less than 0.05. We confirmed
   DAs can effectively extract meaningful genomic features from genomic
   data and concatenating multiple data sources can improve the
   significance of the features associated with breast cancer patients'
   clinical characteristics and outcomes.

AB Removal of the proliferation component of gene expression by
   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) adjustment via statistical
   methods has been addressed in numerous survival prediction studies for
   breast cancer and all cancers in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These
   studies indicate that the removal of proliferation in gene expression by
   PCNA adjustment removes the statistical significance for predicting
   overall survival (OS) when gene selection is performed on a genome-wide
   basis. Since cancers become addicted to DNA repair as a result of forced
   cellular replication, increased oxidation, and repair deficiencies from
   oncogenic loss or genetic polymorphisms, we hypothesized that PCNA
   adjustment of DNA repair gene expression does not remove statistical
   significance for OS prediction. The rationale and importance of this
   translational hypothesis is that new lists of repair genes which are
   predictive of OS can be identified to establish new targets for
   inhibition therapy. A candidate gene approach was employed using TCGA
   RNA-Seq data for 121 DNA repair genes in 8 molecular pathways to predict
   OS for 18 cancers. Statistical randomization test results indicate that
   after PCNA adjustment, OS could be predicted significantly by sets of
   DNA repair genes for 61% (11/18) of the cancers. These findings suggest
   that removal of the proliferation signal in expression by PCNA
   adjustment does not remove statistical significance for predicting OS.
   In conclusion, it is likely that previous studies on PCNA adjustment and
   survival were biased because genes identified through a genome-wide
   approach are strongly co-regulated by proliferation.

   progression has not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, we sought
   to systematically investigate the expression of C1QBP to evaluate the
   change of C1QBP expression and the relationship with patient survival
   and affected pathways in breast, lung, colon, and bladder cancers as
   well as lymphoma. Relative expression levels of C1QBP were analyzed
   using the Oncomine, Gene Expression Across Normal and Tumor Tissue
   (GENT), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Mutations and copy
   number alterations in C1QBP were also analyzed using cBioPortal, and
   subsequently, the relationship between C1QBP expression and survival
   probability of cancer patients was explored using the PrognoScan
   database and the R2: Kaplan Meier Scanner. Additionally, the relative
   expression of C1QBP in other cancers, and correlation of C1QBP
   expression with patient survival were investigated. Gene ontology and
   pathway analysis of commonly differentially coexpressed genes with C1QBP
   in breast, lung, colon, and bladder cancers as well as lymphoma revealed
   the C1QBP-correlated pathways in these cancers. This data-driven study
   demonstrates the correlation of C1QBP expression with patient survival
   and identifies possible C1QBP-involved pathways, which may serve as
   targets of a novel therapeutic modality for various human cancers.

AB M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) infiltration contributes to
   cancer malignant progression. However, the mechanisms for controlling
   recruitment and M2 polarization of macrophages by cancer cells are
   largely unclear. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is abundantly expressed in
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mediates cancer progression. NOXs
   are in close relation with cancer-related inflammation, nevertheless,
   whether tumoral NOXs influence microenvironmental macrophages remains
   undentified. This study found that there was a close association between
   NOX4 expression and macrophage chemotaxis in patients with NSCLC
   analyzed using TCGA RNA-sequencing data. NOX4 in NSCLC cells (A549 and
   Calu-1 cell lines) efficiently enhanced murine peritoneal macrophage
   migration and induces M2 polarization. Immunohistochemical analysis of
   clinical specimens confirmed the positive correlation of NOX4 and CD68
   or CD206. The mechanical study revealed that tumoral NOX4-induced
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulated various cytokine production,
   including CCL7, IL8, CSF-1 and VEGF-C, via PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent
   manner. Blockade of the function of these cytokines reversed NOX4 effect
   on macrophages. Specifically, the results showed that tumoral
   NOX4-educated M2 macrophages exhibited elevated JNK activity, expressed
   and released HB-EGF, thus facilitating NSCLC proliferation in vitro.
   Pretreatment of macrophages with JNK inhibitor blocked tumoral
   NOX4-induced HB-EGF production in M2 macrophages. Finally, in a
   xenograft mouse model, overexpression of NOX4 in A549 cells enhanced the
   tumor growth. Elimination of ROS by NAC or inhibition of NOX4 activity
   by GKT137831 suppressed tumor growth accompanied by reduction in
   macrophage infiltration and the percentage of M2 macrophages. In
   conclusion, our study indicates that tumoral NOX4 recruits M2 TAMs via
   ROS/PI3K signaling-dependent various cytokine production, thus
   contributing NSCLC cell growth.

AB Phosphoinositide signaling pathway orchestrates primordial molecular and
   cellular functions in both healthy and pathologic conditions.
   Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 lipid kinase (PIP4K2)
   family, which compromises PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B and PIP4K2C, has drawn the
   attention in human cancers. Particularly in hematological malignancies,
   PIP4K2A was already described as an essential protein for a malignant
   phenotype, although the clinical and biological impact of PIP4K2B and
   PIP4K2C proteins have not being explored in the same extent. In the
   present study, we investigated the impact on clinical outcomes and gene
   network of PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B and PIP4K2C mRNA transcripts in acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML) patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (2013) study. Our results indicate that PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C, but not
   PIP4K2B, mRNA levels were significantly reduced in AML patients assigned
   to the favorable risk group (p<0.05) and low levels of PIP4K2A and
   PIP4K2C positively affect clinical outcomes of AML patients (p<0.05).
   Gene set enrichment analyses indicate that the expression of PIP4K2
   genes is associated with biological process such as signal transduction,
   metabolism of RNA and genomic instability related-gene sets. In summary,
   our study provides additional evidence of the involvement of members of
   the PIP4K2 family, in particular PIP4K2A and PIP4K2C, in AML.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cell division cycle 25C (CDC25C) is involved in the
   regulation of the G2/M phase transition and is associated with various
   cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer. We evaluated its
   prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) based on data from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
   METHODS: Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and logistic
   regression were used to evaluate relationships between
   clinical-pathologic features and CDC25C expression. Cox regression
   analyses and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to evaluate factors
   contributing to prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was
   performed.
   RESULTS: High CDC25C expression in LUAD was associated with a high tumor
   extent (odds ratio (OR) = 2.23 (1.52-3.29), P < 0.001), regional lymph
   node invasion (OR=2.18 (1.48-3.22), P < 0.001), OR=advanced stage
   (OR = 2.47 (1.72-3.59), P < 0.001), and poor status (OR = 1.87
   (1.19-2.96), P = 0.007). A univariate analysis showed that high CDC25C
   expression is associated with a short overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.873;
   95% CI: 1.385-2.535; P < 0.001) and poor progression-free survival (HR:
   1.503; 95% CI: 1.173-1.926; P = 0.0012). In a multivariate analysis,
   high CDC25C expression was associated with poor OS (HR = 2.193; CI:
   1.394-3.452, P = 0.001). GSEA showed the enrichment of cell cycle,
   apoptosis, p53-dependent G1 DNA damage response, S-phase, mitotic M-M G1
   phases, and FA-mediated cell death in the CDC25C high-expression
   phenotype.
   CONCLUSIONS: CDC25C predicts poor prognosis in LUAD and may function in
   cell cycle regulation and FAS-mediated apoptosis.

AB Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of
   kidney cancer, comprising approximately 75% of all kidney tumors. Recent
   the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome
   Consortium (ICGC) studies have significantly advanced the molecular
   characterization of RCC and facilitated the development of targeted
   therapies. Such advances have improved the median survival of patients
   with advanced disease from less than 10 months prior to 2004 to 30
   months by 2011. However, approximately 30% of localized ccRCC patients
   will nevertheless develop recurrence or metastasis after surgical
   resection of their tumor. Therefore, it is critical to further analyze
   potential tumor-associated proteins and their profiles during disease
   progression. Over the past decade, tremendous effort has been focused on
   the study of molecular pathways, including genomics, transcriptomics,
   and proteomics in order to identify potential molecular biomarkers, as
   well as to facilitate early detection, monitor tumor progression and
   uncover potentially therapeutic targets. In this review, we focus on
   recent advances in the proteomic analysis of ccRCC, current strategies
   and challenges, and perspectives in the field. This insight will
   highlight the discovery of tumor-associated proteins, and their
   potential clinical impact on personalized precision-based care in ccRCC.

AB Malignancy of the pancreas is a leading cause of cancer-related
   mortality, with the highest case-fatality of all cancers. Nevertheless,
   the lack of sensitive biomarkers and presence of biological
   heterogeneity precludes its early detection and effective treatment. The
   recent introduction of next-generation sequencing allows
   characterization of multiple driver mutations at genome- and exome-wide
   levels. Sequencing of DNA and RNA from circulating tumour cells has also
   opened an exciting era of non-invasive procedures for tumour detection
   and prognostication. This massively-parallel sequencing technology has
   uncovered the previously obscure molecular mechanisms, providing clues
   for better stratification of patients and identification of druggable
   targets for the disease. Identification of active oncogenic pathways and
   gene-gene interactions may reveal oncogene addiction and synthetic
   lethality. Relevant findings can be extrapolated to develop targeted and
   personalized therapeutic interventions. In addition to known mutational
   events, the role of chromosomal rearrangements in pancreatic neoplasms
   is gradually uncovered. Coupled with bioinformatics pipelines and
   epidemiological analyses, a better framework for risk stratification and
   prognostication of pancreatic cancer will be possible in the near
   future. In this review, we discuss how translational genomic studies
   facilitate our understanding of pathobiology, and development of novel
   diagnostics and therapeutics for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with
   emphases on whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and liquid
   biopsies. We have also re-analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   dataset to look for genetic features associated with altered survival in
   patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
