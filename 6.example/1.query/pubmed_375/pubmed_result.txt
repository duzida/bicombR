AB  - BACKGROUND: Many new medicines have been derived from natural sources such as
      plants, which have a long history of being used for disease treatment. Thus,
      their benefits and side effects have been studied, and plant-related information 
      including plant and disease relations have been accumulated in Medline articles. 
      Because numerous articles are available in Medline and are written in natural
      language, text-mining is important. However, a corpus of plant and disease
      relations is not available yet. Thus, we aimed to construct such a corpus.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we designed and annotated a plant-disease
      relations corpus, and proposed a computational model to predict plant-disease
      relations using the corpus. We categorized plant and disease relations into four 
      types: treatments of diseases, causes of diseases, associations, and negative
      relations. To construct a corpus of plant-disease relations, we first created its
      annotation guidelines and randomly selected 200 Medline abstracts. From these
      abstracts, we identified 1,405 and 1,755 plant and disease mentions, annotated to
      105 and 237 unique plant and disease identifiers, respectively. When we selected 
      sentences containing at least one plant and one disease mention, we extracted 878
      plant and 1,077 disease entities, which finally generated a corpus of
      plant-disease relations including 1,309 relations from 199 abstracts. To verify
      the effectiveness of the corpus, we proposed a convolutional neural network model
      with the shortest dependency path (SDP-CNN) and applied it to the constructed
      corpus. The micro F-score with ten-fold cross-validation was found to be 0.764.
      We also applied the proposed SDP-CNN model to all Medline abstracts. When we
      measured its performance for 483 randomly selected plant-disease co-occurring
      sentences, the model showed a precision of 0.707. CONCLUSION: The plant-disease
      relations corpus is unique and represents an important resource for biomedical
      text-mining. The corpus of plant and disease relations is available at
      http://gcancer.org/pdr/.

AB  - Salmonella, an Enterobacteria is a therapeutically important pathogen for the
      host. The advancement of genome sequencing of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis
      have identified a distinct ROD9 pathogenic island, imparting virulence. The
      occurrence of 17 ROD9 hypothetical proteins, necessitates subsequent
      bioinformatics approach for structural and functional aspects of protein-protein 
      relations or networks in different pathogenic phenotypes express. A collective
      analysis using predictive bioinformatics tools that includes NCBI-BLASTp and
      BLAST2GO annotated the motif patterns and functional significance. The VFDB
      identified 10 virulence proteins at both genomic and metagenomic level.
      Phylogenetic analysis revealed a divergent and convergent relationship between 17
      ROD9 and 41 SP-1 proteins. Here, combining a comprehensive approach from sequence
      based, motif recognitions, domain identification, virulence ability to structural
      modelling provides a precise function to ROD9 proteins biological network, for
      which no experimental information is available.

      Fusion Proteins.
PG  - e1007239
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007239 [doi]
AB  - Tailored therapy aims to cure cancer patients effectively and safely, based on
      the complex interactions between patients' genomic features, disease pathology
      and drug metabolism. Thus, the continual increase in scientific literature drives
      the need for efficient methods of data mining to improve the extraction of useful
      information from texts based on patients' genomic features. An important
      application of text mining to tailored therapy in cancer encompasses the use of
      mutations and cancer fusion genes as moieties that change patients' cellular
      networks to develop cancer, and also affect drug metabolism. Fusion proteins,
      which are derived from the slippage of two parental genes, are produced in cancer
      by chromosomal aberrations and trans-splicing. Given that the two parental
      proteins for predicted fusion proteins are known, we used our previously
      developed method for identifying chimeric protein-protein interactions (ChiPPIs) 
      associated with the fusion proteins. Here, we present a validation approach that 
      receives fusion proteins of interest, predicts their cellular network alterations
      by ChiPPI and validates them by our new method, ProtFus, using an online
      literature search. This process resulted in a set of 358 fusion proteins and
      their corresponding protein interactions, as a training set for a Naive Bayes
      classifier, to identify predicted fusion proteins that have reliable evidence in 
      the literature and that were confirmed experimentally. Next, for a test group of 
      1817 fusion proteins, we were able to identify from the literature 2908 PPIs in
      total, across 18 cancer types. The described method, ProtFus, can be used for
      screening the literature to identify unique cases of fusion proteins and their
      PPIs, as means of studying alterations of protein networks in cancers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to reveal the regulatory roles of microRNAs in head 
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through comprehensive ceRNA,
      miRNA-transcription factor (TF)-hub gene network and survival analysis. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Expression analysis was performed using the 'edgeR' package based on
      The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The ceRNA network was screened by intersecting 
      prediction results from miRcode, miRTarBase, miRDB and TargetScan. GSE30784,
      GSE59102 and GSE107591 from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository were chosen
      for cross-validation. Hub genes were identified using a protein-protein
      interaction network constructed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
      Genes. The Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based
      Text mining (TTRUST) was utilized to map the miRNA-TF-Hub gene network. Patient
      overall survival was analyzed using the 'survival' package in R. Structural and
      functional analysis of miR-204/211 was based on miRbase and RNAstructure.
      RESULTS: A ceRNA network of 178 lncRNAs, 19 miRNAs and 55 mRNAs was generated,
      and a TF regulatory network with 11 miRNAs, 11 TFs and 18 hub genes was
      constructed from the 52 hub genes identified through the protein-protein
      interaction (PPI) network. Survival analysis demonstrated that the dysregulated
      expression of 11 lncRNAs and 14 mRNAs was highly related to overall survival.
      Furthermore, miR-204 and miR-211 were significantly involved in the network with 
      identical mature structures, indicating them as key miRNAs in HNSCC. CONCLUSION: 
      This study reveals the comprehensive molecular regulatory networks centralized by
      miRNAs in HNSCC and uncovers the crucial role of miR-204 and miR-211, which may
      become potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We study the performance of machine learning (ML) methods, including
      neural networks (NNs), to extract mutational test results from pathology reports 
      collected by cancer registries. Given the lack of hand-labeled datasets for
      mutational test result extraction, we focus on the particular use-case of
      extracting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation results in non-small cell
      lung cancers. We explore the generalization of NNs across different registries
      where our goals are twofold: (1) to assess how well models trained on a
      registry's data port to test data from a different registry and (2) to assess
      whether and to what extent such models can be improved using state-of-the-art
      neural domain adaptation techniques under different assumptions about what is
      available (labeled vs unlabeled data) at the target registry site. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We collected data from two registries: the Kentucky Cancer Registry
      (KCR) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FH) Cancer Surveillance
      System. We combine NNs with adversarial domain adaptation to improve
      cross-registry performance. We compare to other classifiers in the standard
      supervised classification, unsupervised domain adaptation, and supervised domain 
      adaptation scenarios. RESULTS: The performance of ML methods varied between
      registries. To extract positive results, the basic convolutional neural network
      (CNN) had an F1 of 71.5% on the KCR dataset and 95.7% on the FH dataset. For the 
      KCR dataset, the CNN F1 results were low when trained on FH data (Positive F1:
      23%). Using our proposed adversarial CNN, without any labeled data, we match the 
      F1 of the models trained directly on each target registry's data. The adversarial
      CNN F1 improved when trained on FH and applied to KCR dataset (Positive F1:
      70.8%). We found similar performance improvements when we trained on KCR and
      tested on FH reports (Positive F1: 45% to 96%). CONCLUSION: Adversarial domain
      adaptation improves the performance of NNs applied to pathology reports. In the
      unsupervised domain adaptation setting, we match the performance of models that
      are trained directly on target registry's data by using source registry's labeled
      data and unlabeled examples from the target registry.

AB  - Under the Safe System framework, Road Authorities have a responsibility to
      deliver inherently safe roads and streets. Addressing this problem depends on
      knowledge of the road network safety conditions and the number of funds available
      for new road safety interventions. It also requires the prioritisation of the
      various interventions that may generate benefits, increasing safety, while
      ensuring that reasonable steps are taken to remedy the deficiencies detected
      within a reasonable timeframe. In this context, Road Safety Inspections (RSI) are
      a proactive tool for identifying safety issues, consisting of a regular,
      systematic, on-site inspection of existing roads, covering the whole road
      network, carried out by trained safety expert teams. This paper aims to describe 
      how topic modelling can be effectively used to identify co-occurrence patterns of
      attributes related to the run-off-road crashes, as well as the corresponding
      patterns of road safety interventions, as described in the RSI reports. We apply 
      latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a widespread method for fitting a topic model,
      to analyse the topics mentioned in RSI reports, divided into two groups: problems
      found; and proposed solutions. For this study, 54 RSI gathered over six years
      (2012-2017) were analysed, covering 4011km of Irish roads. The results indicate
      that important keywords relating to the "forgiving roadside" and "clear zone"
      concepts, as well as the relevant European technical standards (CEN-EN1317 and EN
      12,767), are absent from the extracted latent topics. We also found that the
      frequency of topics related to roadside safety is higher in the problems record
      set than in the solutions record set, meaning that problems are more easily
      identified and related to the roadside area than interventions may be. This paper
      presents methodological empirical evidence that the LDA is appropriate for
      identifying the co-occurrence patterns of attributes related to the ROR crashes
      in road safety inspections' reports, as well as the interventions' patterns
      associated with these crashes. Also, it provides valuable information aimed to
      determine the extent to which national road authorities in Europe and their
      contractors are currently capable of implementing and maintaining compliance with
      roadside standards and guidelines throughout the life cycle of roads.

AB  - MOTIVATION: A biochemical reaction, bio-event, depicts the relationships between 
      participating entities. Current text mining research has been focusing on
      identifying bio-events from scientific literature. However, rare efforts have
      been dedicated to normalize bio-events extracted from scientific literature with 
      the entries in the curated reaction databases, which could disambiguate the
      events and further support interconnecting events into biologically meaningful
      and complete networks. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose BioNorm, a novel method
      of normalizing bio-events extracted from scientific literature to entries in the 
      bio-molecular reaction database, e.g. IntAct. BioNorm considers event
      normalization as a paraphrase identification problem. It represents an entry as a
      natural language statement by combining multiple types of information contained
      in it. Then, it predicts the semantic similarity between the natural language
      statement and the statements mentioning events in scientific literature using a
      long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM). An event will be
      normalized to the entry if the two statements are paraphrase. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first attempt of event normalization in the biomedical
      text mining. The experiments have been conducted using the molecular interaction 
      data from IntAct. The results demonstrate that the method could achieve F-score
      of 0.87 in normalizing event-containing statements. AVAILABILITY AND

TI  - SemNet: Using Local Features to Navigate the Biomedical Concept Graph.
PG  - 156
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00156 [doi]
AB  - Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) aims to connect scientists across silos by
      assembling models of the literature to reveal previously hidden connections.
      Unfortunately, LBD systems have been unable to achieve user adoption on a large
      scale. This work develops opens source software in Python to convert a database
      of semantic predications of all of PubMed's 27.9 million indexed abstracts into a
      semantic inference network and biomedical concept graph in Neo4j. The developed
      software, called SemNet, queries a modified version of the publicly available
      SemMedDB and computes feature vectors on source-target pairs. Each unique United 
      Medical Language System (UMLS) concept is represented as a node and each
      predication as an edge. Each node is assigned one of 132 node labels (e.g., Amino
      Acid, Peptide, or Protein (AAPP); Gene or Genome (GG); etc.) and each edge is
      labeled with one of 58 predications (e.g. treats, causes, inhibits, etc.). SemNet
      computes a single feature value for each metapath, or sequence of node types,
      between a source node and user-specified target node(s). Several different types 
      of metapath-based features (count, degree weighted path count, and HeteSim
      metric) are computed and vectorized. SemNet employs an unsupervised learning
      algorithm for rank aggregation (ULARA) to rank identified source nodes that are
      most relevant to the user-specified target nodes(s). Statistical analysis of
      correlation among identified source nodes or resultant literature network
      features are used to identify patterns that can guide future research. Analysis
      of high residual nodes is used to compare and contrast SemNet rankings between
      different targets of interest. An example SemNet use case is presented to assess 
      "the differential impact of smoking on cognition in males and females" using the 
      following target nodes: nicotine, learning, memory, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
      cigarette smoke, X chromosome, and Y chromosome. Detailed rankings are discussed.
      Overall results suggest a hypothesis where smoking negatively impacts cognition
      to a greater extent in females, but smoking has stronger cardiovascular impacts
      in males. In summary, SemNet provides an adoptable method for efficient LBD of
      PubMed that extends beyond omics-only relationships to true multi-scalar
      connections that can provide actionable insight for predictive medicine, research
      prioritization, and clinical care.

TI  - Deciphering the multicomponent synergy mechanisms of SiNiSan prescription on
      irritable bowel syndrome using a bioinformatics/network topology based strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SiNiSan (SNS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription
      that has been widely used in the clinical treatment of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS). However, the underlying active substances and molecular mechanisms remain 
      obscure. PURPOSE: A bioinformatics/topology based strategy was proposed for
      identification of the drug targets, therapeutic agents and molecular mechanisms
      of SiNiSan against irritable bowel syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this work,
      a bioinformatics/network topology based strategy was employed by integrating ADME
      filtering, text mining, bioinformatics, network topology, Venn analysis and
      molecular docking to uncover systematically the multicomponent synergy
      mechanisms. In vivo experimental validation was executed in a Visceral
      Hypersensitivity (VHS) rat model. RESULTS: 76 protein targets and 109 active
      components of SNS were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 116
      disease pathways associated with IBS therapy could be classified into the 19
      statistically enriched functional sub-groups. The multi-functional co-synergism
      of SNS against IBS were predicted, including inflammatory reaction regulation,
      oxidative-stress depression regulation and hormone and immune regulation. The
      multi-component synergetic effects were also revealed on the herbal combination
      of SNS. The hub-bottleneck genes of the protein networks including PTGS2, CALM2, 
      NOS2, SLC6A3 and MAOB, MAOA, CREB1 could become potential drug targets and
      Paeoniflorin, Naringin, Glycyrrhizic acid may be candidate agents. Experimental
      results showed that the potential mechanisms of SiNiSan treatment involved in the
      suppression of activation of Dopaminergic synapse and Amphetamine addiction
      signaling pathways, which are congruent with the prediction by the systematic
      approach. CONCLUSION: The integrative investigation based on
      bioinformatics/network topology strategy may elaborate the multicomponent synergy
      mechanisms of SNS against IBS and provide the way out to develop new combination 
      medicines for IBS.

TI  - Comprehensive Review of Models and Methods for Inferences in Bio-Chemical
      Reaction Networks.
PG  - 549
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2019.00549 [doi]
AB  - The key processes in biological and chemical systems are described by networks of
      chemical reactions. From molecular biology to biotechnology applications,
      computational models of reaction networks are used extensively to elucidate their
      non-linear dynamics. The model dynamics are crucially dependent on the parameter 
      values which are often estimated from observations. Over the past decade, the
      interest in parameter and state estimation in models of (bio-) chemical reaction 
      networks (BRNs) grew considerably. The related inference problems are also
      encountered in many other tasks including model calibration, discrimination,
      identifiability, and checking, and optimum experiment design, sensitivity
      analysis, and bifurcation analysis. The aim of this review paper is to examine
      the developments in literature to understand what BRN models are commonly used,
      and for what inference tasks and inference methods. The initial collection of
      about 700 documents concerning estimation problems in BRNs excluding books and
      textbooks in computational biology and chemistry were screened to select over 270
      research papers and 20 graduate research theses. The paper selection was
      facilitated by text mining scripts to automate the search for relevant keywords
      and terms. The outcomes are presented in tables revealing the levels of interest 
      in different inference tasks and methods for given models in the literature as
      well as the research trends are uncovered. Our findings indicate that many
      combinations of models, tasks and methods are still relatively unexplored, and
      there are many new research opportunities to explore combinations that have not
      been considered-perhaps for good reasons. The most common models of BRNs in
      literature involve differential equations, Markov processes, mass action
      kinetics, and state space representations whereas the most common tasks are the
      parameter inference and model identification. The most common methods in
      literature are Bayesian analysis, Monte Carlo sampling strategies, and model
      fitting to data using evolutionary algorithms. The new research problems which
      cannot be directly deduced from the text mining data are also discussed.

      estrogen-receptor negative breast tumors using multi-omics data and text mining.
PG  - 3894-3909
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.26995 [doi]
AB  - Estrogen-receptor negative (ERneg) breast cancer is an aggressive breast cancer
      subtype in the need for new therapeutic options. We have analyzed metabolomics,
      proteomics and transcriptomics data for a cohort of 276 breast tumors (MetaCancer
      study) and nine public transcriptomics datasets using univariate statistics,
      meta-analysis, Reactome pathway analysis, biochemical network mapping and text
      mining of metabolic genes. In the MetaCancer cohort, a total of 29% metabolites, 
      21% proteins and 33% transcripts were significantly different (raw p <0.05)
      between ERneg and ERpos breast tumors. In the nine public transcriptomics
      datasets, on average 23% of all genes were significantly different (raw p <0.05).
      Specifically, up to 60% of the metabolic genes were significantly different
      (meta-analysis raw p <0.05) across the transcriptomics datasets. Reactome pathway
      analysis of all omics showed that energy metabolism, and biosynthesis of
      nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids were associated with ERneg status. Text
      mining revealed that several significant metabolic genes and enzymes have been
      rarely reported to date, including PFKP, GART, PLOD1, ASS1, NUDT12, FAR1, PDE7A, 
      FAHD1, ITPK1, SORD, HACD3, CDS2 and PDSS1. Metabolic processes associated with
      ERneg tumors were identified by multi-omics integration analysis of metabolomics,
      proteomics and transcriptomics data. Overall results suggested that TCA
      anaplerosis, proline biosynthesis, synthesis of complex lipids and mechanisms for
      recycling substrates were activated in ERneg tumors. Under-reported genes were
      revealed by text mining which may serve as novel candidates for drug targets in
      cancer therapies. The workflow presented here can also be used for other tumor
      types.

TI  - [Regional Comparison on Recognition of Tasks for a Home Care System-Analysis of
      Medical Plans of 47 Prefectures by Text Mining and GIS].
PG  - 110-112
AB  - A medical plan reflectsthe current state of a region. The purpose of thisres
      earch isto analyze medical plansby text mining and examine geographical features 
      using a geographic information system. From the medical plans of 47 prefectures, 
      nationwide, 6 regional divisions', and four age groups' text fileswere prepared. 
      Further, wordswere extracted and subsequently, their relevance wasanalyzed.
      Additionally, we examined the geographical featuresus ing a color-dividing
      Japanese map by the word appearance rate of"Mitori"(end-of-life care), which is
      an important task. In the aggregate nationwide text files, 214,716 words were
      extracted. The top frequent words were medical care, home, support, nursing care,
      visit, medical treatment, and cooperation. In the co-occurrence network, medical 
      care- home- nursing care- cooperation were connected with organization-
      construction. There was a link between human resources- training in Kanto and
      Kinki."Mitori"frequently occurred in areaswith a high aging rate, and there wasa 
      human resources- training- securing connection in areas with a low aging rate.
      The frequency of"Mitori"was high in western Japan. The results suggested that
      collaboration between medical care and nursing care is emphasized in medical
      planning. Further,"Mitori"was emphasized in western Japan or areas with a high
      aging rate while human resourcesdevelopment wasemphas ized in areaswith a low
      aging rate.

TI  - Analyzing and Visualizing Knowledge Structures of Health Informatics from 1974 to
      2018: A Bibliometric and Social Network Analysis.
PG  - 61-72
LID - 10.4258/hir.2019.25.2.61 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: This paper aims to provide a theoretical clarification of the health 
      informatics field by conducting a quantitative review analysis of the health
      informatics literature. And this paper aims to map scientific networks; to
      uncover the explicit and hidden patterns, knowledge structures, and
      sub-structures in scientific networks; to track the flow and burst of scientific 
      topics; and to discover what effects they have on the scientific growth of health
      informatics. Methods: This study was a quantitative literature review of the
      health informatics field, employing text mining and bibliometric research
      methods. This paper reviews 30,115 articles with health informatics as their
      topic, which are indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection Database from 1974
      to 2018. This study analyzed and mapped four networks: author co-citation
      network, co-occurring author keywords and keywords plus, co-occurring subject
      categories, and country co-citation network. We used CiteSpace 5.3 and VOSviewer 
      to analyze data, and we used Gephi 0.9.2 and VOSviewer to visualize the networks.
      Results: This study found that the three major themes of the literature from 1974
      to 2018 were the utilization of computer science in healthcare, the impact of
      health informatics on patient safety and the quality of healthcare, and decision 
      support systems. The study found that, since 2016, health informatics has entered
      a new era to provide predictive, preventative, personalized, and participatory
      healthcare systems. Conclusions: This study found that the future strands of
      research may be patient-generated health data, deep learning algorithms,
      quantified self and self-tracking tools, and Internet of Things based decision
      support systems.

TI  - Identifying Clinical Terms in Medical Text Using Ontology-Guided Machine
      Learning.
PG  - e12596
LID - 10.2196/12596 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automatic recognition of medical concepts in unstructured text is an 
      important component of many clinical and research applications, and its accuracy 
      has a large impact on electronic health record analysis. The mining of medical
      concepts is complicated by the broad use of synonyms and nonstandard terms in
      medical documents. OBJECTIVE: We present a machine learning model for concept
      recognition in large unstructured text, which optimizes the use of ontological
      structures and can identify previously unobserved synonyms for concepts in the
      ontology. METHODS: We present a neural dictionary model that can be used to
      predict if a phrase is synonymous to a concept in a reference ontology. Our
      model, called the Neural Concept Recognizer (NCR), uses a convolutional neural
      network to encode input phrases and then rank medical concepts based on the
      similarity in that space. It uses the hierarchical structure provided by the
      biomedical ontology as an implicit prior embedding to better learn embedding of
      various terms. We trained our model on two biomedical ontologies-the Human
      Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical
      Terms (SNOMED-CT). RESULTS: We tested our model trained on HPO by using two
      different data sets: 288 annotated PubMed abstracts and 39 clinical reports. We
      achieved 1.7%-3% higher F1-scores than those for our strongest manually
      engineered rule-based baselines (P=.003). We also tested our model trained on the
      SNOMED-CT by using 2000 Intensive Care Unit discharge summaries from MIMIC
      (Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care) and achieved 0.9%-1.3% 
      higher F1-scores than those of our baseline. The results of our experiments show 
      high accuracy of our model as well as the value of using the taxonomy structure
      of the ontology in concept recognition. CONCLUSION: Most popular medical concept 
      recognizers rely on rule-based models, which cannot generalize well to unseen
      synonyms. In addition, most machine learning methods typically require large
      corpora of annotated text that cover all classes of concepts, which can be
      extremely difficult to obtain for biomedical ontologies. Without relying on
      large-scale labeled training data or requiring any custom training, our model can
      be efficiently generalized to new synonyms and performs as well or better than
      state-of-the-art methods custom built for specific ontologies.

TI  - GIDB: a knowledge database for the automated curation and multidimensional
      analysis of molecular signatures in gastrointestinal cancer.
LID - baz051 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/database/baz051 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is common, characterized by high mortality, and
      includes oesophagus, gastric, liver, bile duct, pancreas, rectal and colon
      cancers. The insufficient specificity and sensitivity of biomarkers is still a
      key clinical hindrance for GI cancer diagnosis and successful treatment. The
      emergence of `precision medicine', `basket trial' and `field cancerization'
      concepts calls for an urgent need and importance for the understanding of how
      organ system cancers occur at the molecular levels. Knowledge from both the
      literature and data available in public databases is informative in elucidating
      the molecular alterations underlying GI cancer. Currently, most available cancer 
      databases have not offered a comprehensive discovery of gene-disease
      associations, molecular alterations and clinical information by integrated text
      mining and data mining in GI cancer. We develop GIDB, a panoptic knowledge
      database that attempts to automate the curation of molecular signatures using
      natural language processing approaches and multidimensional analyses. GIDB covers
      information on 8730 genes with both literature and data supporting evidence, 248 
      miRNAs, 58 lncRNAs, 320 copy number variations, 49 fusion genes and 2381 semantic
      networks. It presents a comprehensive database, not only in parallelizing
      supporting evidence and data integration for signatures associated with GI cancer
      but also in providing the timeline feature of major molecular discoveries. It
      highlights the most comprehensive overview, research hotspots and the development
      of historical knowledge of genes in GI cancer. Furthermore, GIDB characterizes
      genomic abnormalities in multilevel analysis, including simple somatic mutations,
      gene expression, DNA methylation and prognosis. GIDB offers a user-friendly
      interface and two customizable online tools (Heatmap and Network) for
      experimental researchers and clinicians to explore data and help them shorten the
      learning curve and broaden the scope of knowledge. More importantly, GIDB is an
      ongoing research project that will continue to be updated and improve the
      automated method for reducing manual work.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For mothers who experience transplants, pregnancy and childcare can
      have significant consequences on their quality of life. This study aims to
      investigate the childcare-related suffering faced by women who gave birth
      following kidney transplantation. METHODS: Data were collected from 65 Japanese
      kidney transplant recipients from 21 hospitals who had given birth after
      transplant. The questionnaire included questions concerning the childcare-related
      suffering of the female kidney transplant recipients. The data were analyzed
      using KH Coder for the qualitative text mining analysis. RESULTS: The results of 
      the co-occurrence network of words and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed 6
      categories that were identified regarding the difficulties in childcare
      experienced by mothers who gave birth after kidney transplantation: comparing
      themselves with healthy mothers, parenting priorities, getting tired, not being
      able to take medicine on time, carefully giving the child a hug, being unable to 
      give breast milk, having regular doctor checkups, and having to leave the child. 
      CONCLUSION: Recipients experience suffering related to the lifestyle changes that
      occur as a matter of course during childcare. Recipients are exhausted because of
      how busy they are with childcare, and they sometimes forget to take their
      medicine. It is necessary to confirm the living situations of recipients after
      birth and provide support for their self-management based on their new
      lifestyles.

TI  - Repurposing drugs to target nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
PG  - 1783-1796
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v25.i15.1783 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disorder that has evolved
      in recent years as the leading global cause of chronic liver damage. The main
      obstacle to better disease management pertains to the lack of approved
      pharmacological interventions for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH) and NASH-fibrosis-the severe histological forms. Over the past decade,
      tremendous advances have been made in NAFLD research, resulting in the discovery 
      of disease mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets. Hence, a large number of
      pharmacological agents are currently being tested for safety and efficacy. These 
      drugs are in the initial pharmacological phases (phase 1 and 2), which involve
      testing tolerability, therapeutic action, and pharmacological issues. It is thus 
      reasonable to assume that the next generation of NASH drugs will not be available
      for clinical use for foreseeable future. The expected delay can be mitigated by
      drug repurposing or repositioning, which essentially relies on identifying and
      developing new uses for existing drugs. Here, we propose a drug candidate
      selection method based on the integration of molecular pathways of disease
      pathogenesis into network analysis tools that use OMICs data as well as multiples
      sources, including text mining from the medical literature.

AB  - PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a common and often stressful
      adverse effect associated with chemotherapy. CIA can cause more psychosocial
      pressure in patients, including effects on sexuality, self-esteem, and social
      relationships. We analyzed publicly available data to identify drugs formulated
      for topical use targeting the relevant CIA molecular pathways by using
      computational tools. METHODS: The genes associated with CIA were determined by
      text mining, and the gene ontology of the gene set was studied using the
      Functional Enrichment analysis tool. Protein-protein interaction network analysis
      was performed using the String database. Enriched gene sets belonging to the
      identified pathways were queried against the Drug-Gene Interaction database to
      find drug candidates for topical use in CIA. FINDINGS: Our analysis identified
      427 genes common to CIA text-mining concepts. Gene enrichment analysis and
      protein-protein interaction analysis yielded 19 genes potentially targetable by a
      total of 29 drugs that could possibly be formulated for topical application.
      IMPLICATIONS: The findings from the present analysis would give a new thought to 
      help discover more effective agents, and present tremendous opportunities to
      study novel target pharmacology and facilitate drug repositioning efforts in the 
      pharmaceutical industry.

TI  - Evaluating alcohol and marijuana use among emerging adult males via analysis of
      text messages.
PG  - 1547-1557
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2019.1594902 [doi]
AB  - Background: Advances in social technologies offer new tools for large scale data 
      collection and analysis of peer influence and social networks on substance use
      attitudes and behaviors. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine 
      if text message content can predict alcohol and marijuana use attitudes and
      behaviors. Methods: Text messages from 91 males ages 18-25 were monitored over a 
      period of 6 months and examined for content related to alcohol and marijuana.
      Self-report data indicating alcohol and marijuana use attitudes and behaviors
      were used to determine relationships between text message content, social network
      structure, and substance use attitudes and behaviors. Results: In total, 23,173
      text messages were analyzed with 166 text messages including alcohol related
      terms and 195 text messages including drug related terms. Individuals who sent
      text messages related to alcohol use were more likely to have problem alcohol use
      and positive attitudes toward alcohol use, and individuals who sent text messages
      related to marijuana use reported higher frequency of marijuana use and more
      positive attitudes toward marijuana use. Individuals with multiple daily
      marijuana use were in positions that had less control over network structure.
      Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that monitoring text message
      content and social network structure among emerging adult males can potentially
      predict alcohol and marijuana use attitudes and behaviors. Text message content
      analysis is a novel technique increasing our understanding of the role of peer
      influence and social network on substance use attitudes and behaviors.

TI  - Profiling Commenters on Mental Health-Related Online Forums: A Methodological
      Example Focusing on Eating Disorder-Related Commenters.
PG  - e12555
LID - 10.2196/12555 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the characteristics of commenters on mental
      health-related online forums is vital for the development of effective
      psychological interventions in these communities. The way in which commenters
      interact can enhance our understanding of their characteristics. OBJECTIVE: Using
      eating disorder-related (EDR) forums as an example, this study detailed a
      methodology that aimed to determine subtypes of mental health-related forums and 
      profile their commenters based on the other forums to which they contributed.
      METHODS: The researchers identified all public EDR forums (with >/=500
      contributing commenters between March 2017 and February 2018) on a large
      Web-based discussion platform (Reddit). A mixed-methods approach comprising
      network analysis with community detection, text mining, and manual review
      identified subtypes of EDR forums. For each subtype, another network analysis
      with community detection was conducted using the EDR forum commenter overlap
      between 50 forums on which the commenters also commented. The topics of forums in
      each detected community were then manually reviewed to identify the shared
      interests of each subtype of EDR forum commenters. RESULTS: Six subtypes of EDR
      forums were identified, to which 14,024 commenters had contributed. The results
      focus on 2 subtypes-proeating disorder and thinspiration-and communities of
      commenters within both subtypes. Within the proeating disorder subtype, 3
      communities of commenters were detected that related to the body and eating,
      mental health, and women, appearance, and mixed topics. With regard to the
      thinspiration group, 78.17% (849/1086) of commenters had also commented on
      pornographic forums and 16.66% (181/1086) had contributed to proeating disorder
      forums. CONCLUSIONS: The article exemplifies a methodology that provides insight 
      into subtypes of mental health-related forums and the characteristics of their
      commenters. The findings have implications for future research and Web-based
      psychological interventions. With the publicly available data and code provided, 
      researchers can easily reproduce the analyses or utilize the methodology to
      investigate other mental health-related forums.

TI  - An efficient algorithm for identifying mutated subnetworks associated with
      survival in cancer.
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2019.2911069 [doi]
AB  - Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network models interconnections between
      protein-encoding genes. Group of proteins that perform similar functions are
      often connected to each other in PPI network. The corresponding genes form
      pathways or functional modules. Mutation in protein-encoding genes affect
      behavior of pathways. This results in initiation, progression and severity of
      diseases that propagates through pathways. In this work, we integrate mutation,
      survival information of patients and PPI network to identify connected
      subnetworks associated with survival. We define computational problem using
      fitness function called log-rank statistic to score subnetworks. Log-rank
      statistic compares the survival between two populations. We propose a novel
      method, Survival Associated Mutated Subnetwork (SAMS) that adopts genetic
      algorithm strategy to find connected subnetwork within PPI network whose mutation
      yields highest log-rank statistic. We test on real cancer and synthetic datasets.
      SAMS generate solutions in negligible time while state-of-art method in
      literature takes exponential time. Log-rank statistic of SAMS selected mutated
      subnetworks are comparable to the method. Our result genesets show significant
      overlap with well-known cancer driver genes derived from curated datasets and
      studies in literature, display high text-mining score in terms of number of
      citations combined with disease-specific keywords in PubMed and identify pathways
      having high biological relevance.

TI  - Lipid Mini-On: Mining and ontology tool for enrichment analysis of lipidomic
      data.
LID - btz250 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz250 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Here we introduce Lipid Mini-On, an open-source tool that performs lipid
      enrichment analyses and visualizations of lipidomics data. Lipid Mini-On uses a
      text-mining process to bin individual lipid names into multiple lipid ontology
      groups based on the classification (e.g., LipidMaps) and other characteristics,
      such as chain length. Lipid Mini-On provides users with the capability to conduct
      enrichment analysis of the lipid ontology terms using a Shiny app with options of
      five statistical approaches. Lipid classes can be added to customize the user's
      database and remain updated as new lipid classes are discovered. Visualization of
      results is available for all classification options (e.g., lipid subclass and
      individual fatty acid chains). Results are also visualized through an editable
      network of relationships between the individual lipids and their associated lipid
      ontology terms. The utility of the tool is demonstrated using biological (e.g,
      human lung endothelial cells) and environmental (e.g., peat soil) samples.

AB  - There exists over 2.5 million publicly available gene expression samples across
      101,000 data series in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Due to the 
      lack of the use of standardised ontology terms in GEO's free text metadata to
      annotate the experimental type and sample type, this database remains difficult
      to harness computationally without significant manual intervention. In this work,
      we present an interactive R/Shiny tool called GEOracle that utilises text mining 
      and machine learning techniques to automatically identify perturbation
      experiments, group treatment and control samples and perform differential
      expression. We present applications of GEOracle to discover conserved signalling 
      pathway target genes and identify an organ specific gene regulatory network.
      GEOracle is effective in discovering perturbation gene targets in GEO by
      harnessing its free text metadata. Its effectiveness and applicability has been
      demonstrated by cross validation and two real-life case studies. It opens up new 
      avenues to unlock the gene regulatory information embedded inside large
      biological databases such as GEO. GEOracle is available at
      https://github.com/VCCRI/GEOracle.

AB  - Objectives: Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning approaches
      were used to build classifiers to identify genomic-related treatment changes in
      the free-text visit progress notes of cancer patients. Methods: We obtained 5889 
      deidentified progress reports (2439 words on average) for 755 cancer patients who
      have undergone a clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) testing in Wake Forest
      Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center for our data analyses. An NLP system was
      implemented to process the free-text data and extract NGS-related information.
      Three types of recurrent neural network (RNN) namely, gated recurrent unit, long 
      short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (LSTM_Bi) were applied to
      classify documents to the treatment-change and no-treatment-change groups.
      Further, we compared the performances of RNNs to 5 machine learning algorithms
      including Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine for
      classification, Random forest, and Logistic Regression. Results: Our results
      suggested that, overall, RNNs outperformed traditional machine learning
      algorithms, and LSTM_Bi showed the best performance among the RNNs in terms of
      accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In addition, pretrained word embedding
      can improve the accuracy of LSTM by 3.4% and reduce the training time by more
      than 60%. Discussion and Conclusion: NLP and RNN-based text mining solutions have
      demonstrated advantages in information retrieval and document classification
      tasks for unstructured clinical progress notes.

TI  - Team Assembly Mechanisms and the Knowledge Produced in the Mexico's National
      Institute of Geriatrics: A Network Analysis and Agent-Based Modeling Approach.
PG  - 9127657
LID - 10.1155/2019/9127657 [doi]
AB  - Mexico's National Institute of Geriatrics (INGER) is the national research center
      of reference for matters related to human aging. INGER scientists perform basic, 
      clinical, and demographic research which may imply different scientific cultures 
      working together in the same specialized institution. In this paper, by a
      combination of text mining, coauthorship network analysis, and agent-based
      modeling, we analyzed and modeled the team assembly practices and the structure
      of the knowledge produced by scientists from INGER. Our results showed a weak
      connection between basic and clinical research and the emergence of a highly
      connected academic leadership. Importantly, basic and clinical-demographic
      researchers exhibited different team assembly strategies: basic researchers
      tended to form larger teams mainly with external collaborators, while clinical
      and demographic researchers formed smaller teams that very often incorporated
      internal (INGER) collaborators. We showed how these two different ways to form
      research teams impacted the organization of knowledge produced at INGER.
      Following these observations, we modeled, via agent-based modeling, the
      coexistence of different scientific cultures (basic and clinical research)
      exhibiting different team assembly strategies in the same institution. Three
      virtual experiments were run in our agent-based model. The three experiments kept
      similar values to the collaborating dynamics of INGER in terms of average team
      size and probabilities of choosing incumbents and external collaborators. The
      only difference among these experiments was the value of homophily defined as the
      trend to collaborate with research studies from the same field (14% corresponding
      to the 46% and 79%). The main result of these experiments is that by modulating
      just one variable (homophily), we could successfully reproduce the current
      situation of INGER (homophily of 79%) and simulate alternative scenarios in which
      interdisciplinary (46%) and transdisciplinary (14%) research could be done.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is among the most common chronic neurologic diseases. There
      is a need for more data on patient perspectives of treatment to guide
      patient-centered care initiatives. Patients with epilepsy share their experiences
      on social media anonymously, but little is known about those discussions. Our aim
      was to learn what patients with epilepsy discuss regarding their condition and
      identify treatment-related themes from online patient support groups. METHODS: A 
      total of 355,838 posts were collected from three online support groups for
      patients with epilepsy through a crawling script, and an analytical pipeline was 
      built to identify patient conversation content through leveraging of multiple
      text mining methods. Results were also displayed by network visualization
      methods. RESULTS: Patients with epilepsy sought information about medical
      treatments, shared their treatment experiences, and sought help from other
      posters. Key themes related to treatments included the search for optimal
      personalized treatment strategies as well as identifying and coping with adverse 
      effects. SIGNIFICANCE: This study showed the feasibility of learning about
      concerns of patients with epilepsy, especially treatment issues, through text
      mining methods. However, some manual selection and filtering were necessary to
      ensure quality results for the treatment analysis. Providers should be aware of
      online discussions and use analyses of such discussions to help guide effective
      patient engagement during care.

TI  - Increased cerebral nuclear factor kappa B in a complex regional pain syndrome rat
      model: possible relationship between peripheral injury and the brain.
PG  - 909-914
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S166270 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare but refractory pain
      disorder. Recent advanced information retrieval studies using text-mining and
      network analysis have suggested nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) as a possible
      central mediator of CRPS. The brain is also known to play important roles in
      CRPS. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in cerebral NFkappaB in rats 
      with CRPS. Materials and methods: The chronic post-ischemia perfusion (CPIP)
      model was used as the CRPS animal model. O-rings were applied to the left hind
      paws of the rats. The rats were categorized into three groups according to the
      results of behavioral tests: the CPIP-positive (A) group, the CPIP-negative (B)
      group, and the control (C) group. Three weeks after the CPIP procedure, the right
      cerebrums of the animals were harvested to measure NFkappaB levels using an
      ELISA. Results: Animals in group A had significantly decreased mechanical pain
      thresholds (P<0.01) and significantly increased cerebral NFkappaB when compared
      to those in groups B and C (P=0.024). Conclusion: This finding indicates that
      peripheral injury increases cerebral NFkappaB levels and implies that minor
      peripheral injury can lead to the activation of pain-related cerebral processes
      in CRPS.

AB  - Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by impaired 
      fear extinction, excessive anxiety, and depression. However, the potential
      pathogenesis and cause of PTSD are not fully understood. Hence, the purpose of
      this study was to identify key genes and pathway involved in PTSD and reveal
      underlying molecular mechanisms by using bioinformatics analysis. Methods: The
      mRNA microarray expression profile dataset was retrieved and downloaded from the 
      Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
      were screened using GEO2R. Gene ontology (GO) was used for gene function
      annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway was
      performed for enrichment analysis. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction
      (PPI) network and module analysis by the plugin MCODE were mapped by Cytoscape
      software. Finally, these key genes were verified in stress-exposed models by
      Real-Time quantitative (qRT-PCR). In addition, we performed text mining among the
      key genes and pathway with PTSD by using COREMINE. Results: A total of 1004 DEGs 
      were identified. Gene functional annotations and enrichment analysis indicated
      that the most associated pathway was closely related to the Wnt signaling
      pathway. Using PPI network and module analysis, we identified a group of "seed"
      genes. These genes were further verified by qRT-PCR. In addition, text mining
      indicated that the altered CYP1A2, SYT1, and NLGN1 affecting PTSD might work via 
      the Wnt signaling pathway. Conclusion: By using bioinformatics analysis, we
      identified a number of genes and relevant pathway which may represent key
      mechanisms associated with PTSD. However, these findings require verification in 
      future experimental studies.

TI  - Automatic Human-like Mining and Constructing Reliable Genetic Association
      Database with Deep Reinforcement Learning.
PG  - 112-123
AB  - The increasing amount of scientific literature in biological and biomedical
      science research has created a challenge in continuous and reliable curation of
      the latest knowledge discovered, and automatic biomedical text-mining has been
      one of the answers to this challenge. In this paper, we aim to further improve
      the reliability of biomedical text-mining by training the system to directly
      simulate the human behaviors such as querying the PubMed, selecting articles from
      queried results, and reading selected articles for knowledge. We take advantage
      of the efficiency of biomedical text-mining, the exibility of deep reinforcement 
      learning, and the massive amount of knowledge collected in UMLS into an
      integrative artificial intelligent reader that can automatically identify the
      authentic articles and effectively acquire the knowledge conveyed in the
      articles. We construct a system, whose current primary task is to build the
      genetic association database between genes and complex traits of human. Our
      contributions in this paper are three-fold: 1) We propose to improve the
      reliability of text-mining by building a system that can directly simulate the
      behavior of a researcher, and we develop corresponding methods, such as
      Bi-directional LSTM for text mining and Deep Q-Network for organizing behaviors. 
      2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with an example in constructing
      a genetic association database. 3) We release our implementation as a generic
      framework for researchers in the community to conveniently construct other
      databases.

TI  - Global Genetics Research in Prostate Cancer: A Text Mining and Computational
      Network Theory Approach.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2019.00070 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common cancer type in men in Finland and second
      worldwide. In this paper, we analyze almost 150, 000 published papers about
      prostate cancer, authored by ten thousands of scientists worldwide, with an
      integrated text mining and computational network theory approach. We demonstrate 
      how to integrate text mining with network analysis investigating research
      contributions of countries and collaborations within and between countries.
      Furthermore, we study the time evolution of individually and collectively studied
      genes. Finally, we investigate a collaboration network of Finland and compare
      studied genes with globally studied genes in prostate cancer genetics. Overall,
      our results provide a global overview of prostate cancer research in genetics. In
      addition, we present a specific discussion for Finland. Our results shed light on
      trends within the last 30 years and are useful for translational researchers
      within the full range from genetics to public health management and health
      policy.

TI  - deepBioWSD: effective deep neural word sense disambiguation of biomedical text
      data.
PG  - 438-446
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy189 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In biomedicine, there is a wealth of information hidden in
      unstructured narratives such as research articles and clinical reports. To
      exploit these data properly, a word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm prevents
      downstream difficulties in the natural language processing applications pipeline.
      Supervised WSD algorithms largely outperform un- or semisupervised and
      knowledge-based methods; however, they train 1 separate classifier for each
      ambiguous term, necessitating a large number of expert-labeled training data, an 
      unattainable goal in medical informatics. To alleviate this need, a single model 
      that shares statistical strength across all instances and scales well with the
      vocabulary size is desirable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Built on recent advances in 
      deep learning, our deepBioWSD model leverages 1 single bidirectional long
      short-term memory network that makes sense prediction for any ambiguous term. In 
      the model, first, the Unified Medical Language System sense embeddings will be
      computed using their text definitions; and then, after initializing the network
      with these embeddings, it will be trained on all (available) training data
      collectively. This method also considers a novel technique for automatic
      collection of training data from PubMed to (pre)train the network in an
      unsupervised manner. RESULTS: We use the MSH WSD dataset to compare WSD
      algorithms, with macro and micro accuracies employed as evaluation metrics.
      deepBioWSD outperforms existing models in biomedical text WSD by achieving the
      state-of-the-art performance of 96.82% for macro accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Apart
      from the disambiguation improvement and unsupervised training, deepBioWSD depends
      on considerably less number of expert-labeled data as it learns the target and
      the context terms jointly. These merit deepBioWSD to be conveniently deployable
      in real-time biomedical applications.

TI  - A text-mining approach to obtain detailed treatment information from free-text
      fields in population-based cancer registries: A study of non-small cell lung
      cancer in California.
PG  - e0212454
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0212454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Population-based cancer registries have treatment information for all
      patients making them an excellent resource for population-level monitoring.
      However, specific treatment details, such as drug names, are contained in a
      free-text format that is difficult to process and summarize. We assessed the
      accuracy and efficiency of a text-mining algorithm to identify systemic
      treatments for lung cancer from free-text fields in the California Cancer
      Registry. METHODS: The algorithm used Perl regular expressions in SAS 9.4 to
      search for treatments in 24,845 free-text records associated with 17,310 patients
      in California diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer between 2012 and
      2014. Our algorithm categorized treatments into six groups that align with
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. We compared results to a manual
      review (gold standard) of the same records. RESULTS: Percent agreement ranged
      from 91.1% to 99.4%. Ranges for other measures were 0.71-0.92 (Kappa),
      74.3%-97.3% (sensitivity), 92.4%-99.8% (specificity), 60.4%-96.4% (positive
      predictive value), and 92.9%-99.9% (negative predictive value). The text-mining
      algorithm used one-sixth of the time required for manual review. CONCLUSION:
      SAS-based text mining of free-text data can accurately detect systemic treatments
      administered to patients and save considerable time compared to manual review,
      maximizing the utility of the extant information in population-based cancer
      registries for comparative effectiveness research.

TI  - Analyzing a co-occurrence gene-interaction network to identify disease-gene
      association.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s12859-019-2634-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the genetic networks and their role in chronic diseases
      (e.g., cancer) is one of the important objectives of biological researchers. In
      this work, we present a text mining system that constructs a
      gene-gene-interaction network for the entire human genome and then performs
      network analysis to identify disease-related genes. We recognize the interacting 
      genes based on their co-occurrence frequency within the biomedical literature and
      by employing linear and non-linear rare-event classification models. We analyze
      the constructed network of genes by using different network centrality measures
      to decide on the importance of each gene. Specifically, we apply betweenness,
      closeness, eigenvector, and degree centrality metrics to rank the central genes
      of the network and to identify possible cancer-related genes. RESULTS: We
      evaluated the top 15 ranked genes for different cancer types (i.e., Prostate,
      Breast, and Lung Cancer). The average precisions for identifying breast,
      prostate, and lung cancer genes vary between 80-100%. On a prostate case study,
      the system predicted an average of 80% prostate-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results show that our system has the potential for improving the prediction
      accuracy of identifying gene-gene interaction and disease-gene associations. We
      also conduct a prostate cancer case study by using the threshold property in
      logistic regression, and we compare our approach with some of the
      state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - A new version of the ANDSystem tool for automatic extraction of knowledge from
      scientific publications with expanded functionality for reconstruction of
      associative gene networks by considering tissue-specific gene expression.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2567-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consideration of tissue-specific gene expression in reconstruction
      and analysis of molecular genetic networks is necessary for a proper description 
      of the processes occurring in a specified tissue. Currently, there are a number
      of computer systems that allow the user to reconstruct molecular-genetic networks
      using the data automatically extracted from the texts of scientific publications.
      Examples of such systems are STRING, Pathway Commons, MetaCore and Ingenuity. The
      MetaCore and Ingenuity systems permit taking into account tissue-specific gene
      expression during the reconstruction of gene networks. Previously, we developed
      the ANDSystem tool, which also provides an automated extraction of knowledge from
      scientific texts and allows the reconstruction of gene networks. The main
      difference between our system and other tools is in the different types of
      interactions between objects, which makes the ANDSystem complementary to existing
      well-known systems. However, previous versions of the ANDSystem did not contain
      any information on tissue-specific expression. RESULTS: A new version of the
      ANDSystem has been developed. It offers the reconstruction of associative gene
      networks while taking into account the tissue-specific gene expression. The
      ANDSystem knowledge base features information on tissue-specific expression for
      272 tissues. The system allows the reconstruction of combined gene networks, as
      well as performing the filtering of genes from such networks using the
      information on their tissue-specific expression. As an example of the application
      of such filtering, the gene network of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway 
      was analyzed. It was shown that considering different tissues can lead to changes
      in gene network structure, including changes in such indicators as betweenness
      centrality of vertices, clustering coefficient, network centralization, network
      density, etc. CONCLUSIONS: The consideration of tissue specificity can play an
      important role in the analysis of gene networks, in particular solving the
      problem of finding the most significant central genes. Thus, the new version of
      ANDSystem can be employed for a wide range of tasks related to biomedical studies
      of individual tissues. It is available at http://www-bionet.sscc.ru/and/cell /.

TI  - OGER++: hybrid multi-type entity recognition.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s13321-018-0326-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present a text-mining tool for recognizing biomedical entities in 
      scientific literature. OGER++ is a hybrid system for named entity recognition and
      concept recognition (linking), which combines a dictionary-based annotator with a
      corpus-based disambiguation component. The annotator uses an efficient look-up
      strategy combined with a normalization method for matching spelling variants. The
      disambiguation classifier is implemented as a feed-forward neural network which
      acts as a postfilter to the previous step. RESULTS: We evaluated the system in
      terms of processing speed and annotation quality. In the speed benchmarks, the
      OGER++ web service processes 9.7 abstracts or 0.9 full-text documents per second.
      On the CRAFT corpus, we achieved 71.4% and 56.7% F1 for named entity recognition 
      and concept recognition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Combining knowledge-based and
      data-driven components allows creating a system with competitive performance in
      biomedical text mining.

TI  - Fuzzy Ontology and LSTM-Based Text Mining: A Transportation Network Monitoring
      System for Assisting Travel.
LID - E234 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s19020234 [doi]
AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) utilize a sensor network-based system
      to gather and interpret traffic information. In addition, mobility users utilize 
      mobile applications to collect transport information for safe traveling. However,
      these types of information are not sufficient to examine all aspects of the
      transportation networks. Therefore, both ITSs and mobility users need a smart
      approach and social media data, which can help ITSs examine transport services,
      support traffic and control management, and help mobility users travel safely.
      People utilize social networks to share their thoughts and opinions regarding
      transportation, which are useful for ITSs and travelers. However, user-generated 
      text on social media is short in length, unstructured, and covers a broad range
      of dynamic topics. The application of recent Machine Learning (ML) approach is
      inefficient for extracting relevant features from unstructured data, detecting
      word polarity of features, and classifying the sentiment of features correctly.
      In addition, ML classifiers consistently miss the semantic feature of the word
      meaning. A novel fuzzy ontology-based semantic knowledge with Word2vec model is
      proposed to improve the task of transportation features extraction and text
      classification using the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)
      approach. The proposed fuzzy ontology describes semantic knowledge about entities
      and features and their relation in the transportation domain. Fuzzy ontology and 
      smart methodology are developed in Web Ontology Language and Java, respectively. 
      By utilizing word embedding with fuzzy ontology as a representation of text,
      Bi-LSTM shows satisfactory improvement in both the extraction of features and the
      classification of the unstructured text of social media.

TI  - BO-LSTM: classifying relations via long short-term memory networks along
      biomedical ontologies.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2584-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have proposed deep learning techniques, namely
      recurrent neural networks, to improve biomedical text mining tasks. However,
      these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources,
      such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set 
      of such resources publicly available, which are continuously being updated.
      Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing
      knowledge about entities, such as genes, chemicals, phenotypes, and disorders.
      These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in 
      training data, particularly in domains with limited labeled data. RESULTS: We
      propose a new model to detect and classify relations in text, BO-LSTM, that takes
      advantage of domain-specific ontologies, by representing each entity as the
      sequence of its ancestors in the ontology. We implemented BO-LSTM as a recurrent 
      neural network with long short-term memory units and using open biomedical
      ontologies, specifically Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI), Human 
      Phenotype, and Gene Ontology. We assessed the performance of BO-LSTM with
      drug-drug interactions mentioned in a publicly available corpus from an
      international challenge, composed of 792 drug descriptions and 233 scientific
      abstracts. By using the domain-specific ontology in addition to word embeddings
      and WordNet, BO-LSTM improved the F1-score of both the detection and
      classification of drug-drug interactions, particularly in a document set with a
      limited number of annotations. We adapted an existing DDI extraction model with
      our ontology-based method, obtaining a higher F1 score than the original model.
      Furthermore, we developed and made available a corpus of 228 abstracts annotated 
      with relations between genes and phenotypes, and demonstrated how BO-LSTM can be 
      applied to other types of relations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that
      besides the high performance of current deep learning techniques, domain-specific
      ontologies can still be useful to mitigate the lack of labeled data.

TI  - Mapping the Literature on Nutritional Interventions in Cognitive Health: A
      Data-Driven Approach.
LID - E38 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu11010038 [doi]
AB  - Manual review of the extensive literature covering nutrition-based lifestyle
      interventions to promote healthy cognitive ageing has proved educational,
      however, data-driven techniques can better account for the large size of the
      literature (tens of thousands of potentially relevant publications to date) and
      interdisciplinary nature, where relevant publications may be found. In this
      study, we present a new way to map the literature landscape, focusing on
      nutrition-based lifestyle interventions to promote healthy cognitive ageing. We
      applied a combination of citation network analysis and text mining to map out the
      existing literature on nutritional interventions and cognitive health. Results
      indicated five overarching clusters of publications, which could be further
      deconstructed into a total of 35 clusters. These could be broadly distinguished
      by the focus on lifespan stages (e.g., infancy versus older age), and specificity
      regarding nutrition (e.g., a narrow focus on iodine deficiency versus a broad
      focus on weight gain). Rather than concentrating into a single cluster,
      interventions were present throughout the majority of the research. We conclude
      that a data-driven map of the nutritional intervention literature can benefit the
      design of future interventions, by highlighting topics and themes that could be
      synthesized across currently disconnected clusters of publications.

TI  - iTextMine: integrated text-mining system for large-scale knowledge extraction
      from the literature.
LID - 10.1093/database/bay128 [doi]
AB  - Numerous efforts have been made for developing text-mining tools to extract
      information from biomedical text automatically. They have assisted in many
      biological tasks, such as database curation and hypothesis generation.
      Text-mining tools are usually different from each other in terms of programming
      language, system dependency and input/output format. There are few previous works
      that concern the integration of different text-mining tools and their results
      from large-scale text processing. In this paper, we describe the iTextMine system
      with an automated workflow to run multiple text-mining tools on large-scale text 
      for knowledge extraction. We employ parallel processing with dockerized
      text-mining tools with a standardized JSON output format and implement a text
      alignment algorithm to solve the text discrepancy for result integration.
      iTextMine presently integrates four relation extraction tools, which have been
      used to process all the Medline abstracts and PMC open access full-length
      articles. The website allows users to browse the text evidence and view
      integrated results for knowledge discovery through a network view. We demonstrate
      the utilities of iTextMine with two use cases involving the gene PTEN and breast 
      cancer and the gene SATB1.

TI  - A neural network approach to chemical and gene/protein entity recognition in
      patents.
PG  - 65

AB  - In biomedical research, patents contain the significant amount of information,
      and biomedical text mining has received much attention in patents recently. To
      accelerate the development of biomedical text mining for patents, the BioCreative
      V.5 challenge organized three tracks, i.e., chemical entity mention recognition
      (CEMP), gene and protein related object recognition (GPRO) and technical
      interoperability and performance of annotation servers, to focus on biomedical
      entity recognition in patents. This paper describes our neural network approach
      for the CEMP and GPRO tracks. In the approach, a bidirectional long short-term
      memory with a conditional random field layer is employed to recognize biomedical 
      entities from patents. To improve the performance, we explored the effect of
      additional features (i.e., part of speech, chunking and named entity recognition 
      features generated by the GENIA tagger) for the neural network model. In the
      official results, our best runs achieve the highest performances (a precision of 
      88.32%, a recall of 92.62%, and an F-score of 90.42% in the CEMP track; a
      precision of 76.65%, a recall of 81.91%, and an F-score of 79.19% in the GPRO
      track) among all participating teams in both tracks.

TI  - Validation study of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the Spanish primary care
      database, BIFAP.
PG  - 209-216
LID - 10.1002/pds.4686 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To define and validate a case-finding algorithm to identify incident
      colorectal cancer (CRC) in the Spanish primary care database BIFAP. METHODS: All 
      potential incident CRC cases recorded during the study period 2001 to 2014 among 
      patients 20 to 89 years old were identified using a defined case-finding
      algorithm tailored to BIFAP database characteristics and based on codes plus text
      mining strategies. Potential CRC cases identified by the algorithm were
      classified into eight homogeneous groups according to recording characteristics. 
      Random samples of 100 cases per group were obtained, and electronic medical
      records were manually reviewed by two independent researchers. Positive
      predictive values (PPVs) were estimated per each group and for the whole sample
      taking into account the stratified sampling. Standardized incidence rate (SIR) of
      CRC was estimated and compared with that reported by the National Cancer
      Registry. Negative predictive value (NPV) was also estimated in a random sample
      of 100 non-CRC patients by the algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 17 008 potential
      CRC cases were identified. Most of them (14793; 87%) were recorded as incident
      diagnosis with linked clinical notes as free text, having this group a PPV of
      92.1% (95%CI: 87.1%-95.3%). The overall PPV including all groups was 87.3%
      (95%CI: 83.3%-90.4%). SIR of CRC was 55.5 per 100.000 person-years. SIR increased
      with age and was higher in men as compared with women (77.7 vs 38.1 per 100.000
      py, respectively) which were in line with those reported by the Network of Cancer
      Registries in Spain. NPV was of 100% (96.3%-100%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows 
      a high validity of the CRC cases identified by the algorithm and a high level of 
      CRC recording in BIFAP database and supports its appropriateness to validly
      identify incident CRC cases in BIFAP.

TI  - PPICurator: A Tool for Extracting Comprehensive Protein-Protein Interaction
      Information.
PG  - e1800291
LID - 10.1002/pmic.201800291 [doi]
AB  - Protein-protein interaction extraction through biological literature curation is 
      widely employed for proteome analysis. There is a strong need for a tool that can
      assist researchers in extracting comprehensive PPI information through literature
      curation, which is critical in research on protein, for example, construction of 
      protein interaction network, identification of protein signaling pathway, and
      discovery of meaningful protein interaction. However, most of current tools can
      only extract PPI relations. None of them are capable of extracting other
      important PPI information, such as interaction directions, effects, and
      functional annotations. To address these issues, this paper proposes PPICurator, 
      a novel tool for extracting comprehensive PPI information with a variety of logic
      and syntax features based on a new support vector machine classifier. PPICurator 
      provides a friendly web-based user interface. It is a platform that automates the
      extraction of comprehensive PPI information through literature, including PPI
      relations, as well as their confidential scores, interaction directions, effects,
      and functional annotations. Thus, PPICurator is more comprehensive than
      state-of-the-art tools. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art tools in the
      accuracy of PPI relation extraction measured by F-score and recall on the widely 
      used open datasets. PPICurator is available at https://ppicurator.hupo.org.cn.

TI  - Embracing the Dark Side: Computational Approaches to Unveil the Functionality of 
      Genes Lacking Biological Annotation in Drug-Induced Liver Injury.
PG  - 527
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2018.00527 [doi]
AB  - In toxicogenomics, functional annotation is an important step to gain additional 
      insights into genes with aberrant expression that drive pathophysiological
      mechanisms. Nevertheless, there exists a gap on annotation of these genes which
      often hampers the interpretation of results and limits their applicability in
      translational medicine. In this study, we evaluated the coverage of functional
      annotations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by 10 selected
      compounds from the TG-GATEs database identified as high- or no-risk in causing
      drug-induced liver injury (most-DILI or no-DILI, respectively) using in vitro
      human data. Functional roles of DEGs not present in the most common biological
      annotation databases - termed "dark genes" - were unveiled via literature mining 
      and via the identification of shared regulatory transcription factors or
      signaling pathways. Our results demonstrated that there were approximately 13% of
      dark genes induced by these compounds in vitro and we were able to obtain
      additional relevant information for up to 76% of those. Using interactome data
      from several sources, we have uncovered genes such as LRBA, and WDR26 as highly
      connected in the protein network that play roles in drug response. Genes such as 
      MALAT1, H19, and MIR29C - whose links to hepatotoxicity have been confirmed -
      were identified as markers for the most-DILI group and appeared as top hits
      across all literature-based mining methods. Furthermore, we investigated the
      potential impact of dark genes on liver toxicity by identifying their rat
      orthologs in combination with their correlation to drug-induced liver pathologies
      observed in vivo following chemical exposure. We identified a set of important
      regulatory transcription factors of dark genes for all most-DILI compounds
      including E2F1 and JUND with supporting evidences in literature and we found
      Magee1 correlated with chemically induced bile duct hyperplasia and adverse
      responses at 29 days in rats in vivo. In conclusion, in this study we show the
      potential role of these poorly annotated genes in mechanisms underlying
      hepatotoxicity and offer a number of computational approaches that may help to
      minimize current gaps in gene annotation and highlight their values as potential 
      biomarkers in toxicological studies.

PG  - D607-D613
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky1131 [doi]
AB  - Proteins and their functional interactions form the backbone of the cellular
      machinery. Their connectivity network needs to be considered for the full
      understanding of biological phenomena, but the available information on
      protein-protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of
      annotation granularity and reliability. The STRING database aims to collect,
      score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein-protein interaction
      information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is 
      to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct
      (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of
      STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The
      most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as
      input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform
      gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis,
      STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and
      KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on
      high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the
      association network itself. The STRING resource is available online at
      https://string-db.org/.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response has a complex pathogenesis; thus, it is a
      critical contributor to the development and complication of many diseases. Zhishi
      and Zhiqiao are famous Citrus herbal medicines that are rich in bioactive
      phenolic constituents with multiple anti-inflammatory activities. PURPOSE:
      Establishment of a multi-component-target-pathway network strategy to investigate
      the usage of Zhishi and Zhiqiao on inflammatory diseases can provide a reference 
      for mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). STUDY DESIGN: A
      multi-component-target-pathway network strategy was constructed to elucidate the 
      various antiinflammatory effects of Zhishi and Zhiqiao by integrating
      multi-constituent determination, network pharmacology, molecular mechanisms in
      cells and integrated metabolomics in animals. METHODS: Based on the
      quantitatively determined global and characteristic chemical profiles of Zhishi
      and Zhiqiao, the component-target-pathway network was predicted by network
      pharmacology coupled with text mining and docking. The potential antiinflammatory
      mechanism of the various components in Zhishi and Zhiqiao were verified using
      LPS-induced inflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 cells. The different metabolic
      regulating effects of Zhishi and Zhiqiao against an LPS-induced inflammation
      model were investigated using a plasma metabolomics strategy. RESULTS: The
      molecular mechanism of Zhishi mainly suppressed the MAPK signaling pathway,
      whereas Zhiqiao emphasized the PPAR-AKT signaling pathways simultaneously to
      block the inflammatory process. Meanwhile, Zhishi and Zhiqiao both exhibited an
      anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway to reduce 
      the production of inflammatory mediators. In the metabolomics study, Zhishi and
      Zhiqiao exhibited variant corrections of the disordered metabolic pathways
      through amino acid metabolism, glycometabolism and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: 
      All of these results indicate that Zhishi and Zhiqiao, in a diversified mixture, 
      exert their anti-inflammatory effect through variant pathways. These findings can
      assist in developing the use of Zhishi and Zhiqiao for inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Cytoscape StringApp: Network Analysis and Visualization of Proteomics Data.
PG  - 623-632
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00702 [doi]
AB  - Protein networks have become a popular tool for analyzing and visualizing the
      often long lists of proteins or genes obtained from proteomics and other
      high-throughput technologies. One of the most popular sources of such networks is
      the STRING database, which provides protein networks for more than 2000
      organisms, including both physical interactions from experimental data and
      functional associations from curated pathways, automatic text mining, and
      prediction methods. However, its web interface is mainly intended for inspection 
      of small networks and their underlying evidence. The Cytoscape software, on the
      other hand, is much better suited for working with large networks and offers
      greater flexibility in terms of network analysis, import, and visualization of
      additional data. To include both resources in the same workflow, we created
      stringApp, a Cytoscape app that makes it easy to import STRING networks into
      Cytoscape, retains the appearance and many of the features of STRING, and
      integrates data from associated databases. Here, we introduce many of the
      stringApp features and show how they can be used to carry out complex network
      analysis and visualization tasks on a typical proteomics data set, all through
      the Cytoscape user interface. stringApp is freely available from the Cytoscape
      app store: http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp .

TI  - Characterizing classes of fibromyalgia within the continuum of central
      sensitization syndrome.
PG  - 2551-2560
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S147199 [doi]
AB  - Background: While fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread pain
      and tenderness, its presentation among patients as a continuum of diseases rather
      than a single disease contributes to the challenges of diagnosis and treatment.
      The purpose of this analysis was to distinguish and characterize classes of FM
      within the continuum using data from chronic pain patients. Methods: FM patients 
      were identified from administrative claims data from the ProCare Systems' network
      of Michigan pain clinics between January 1999 and February 2015. Identification
      was based on either use of traditional criteria (ie, ICD-9 codes) or a predictive
      model indicative of patients having FM. Patients were classified based on
      similarity of comorbidities (symptom severity), region of pain (widespread pain),
      and type and number of procedures (treatment intensity) using unsupervised
      learning. Text mining and a review of physician notes were conducted to assist in
      understanding the FM continuum. Results: A total of 2,529 FM patients with 79,570
      observations or clinical visits were evaluated. Four main classes of FM patients 
      were identified: Class 1) regional FM with classic symptoms; Class 2) generalized
      FM with increasing widespread pain and some additional symptoms; Class 3) FM with
      advanced and associated conditions, increasing widespread pain, increased sleep
      disturbance, and chemical sensitivity; and Class 4) FM secondary to other
      conditions. Conclusion: FM is a disease continuum characterized by progressive
      and identifiable classifications. Four classes of FM can be differentiated by
      pain and symptom severity, specific comorbidities, and use of clinical
      procedures.

PG  - 33-50

AB  - Protein-protein interaction networks (PPIs) collect information on physical-and
      in some cases-functional interactions between proteins. Most PPIs are annotated
      with confidence scores, which reflect the probability that a reported interaction
      is a true interaction. These scores, however, do not allow users to isolate
      interactions relevant in a particular biological context. Here, we describe
      solutions for performing context filtering on PPIs to allow biological data
      interpretation and functional inference in two publicly available PPIs resources 
      (HIPPIE and STRING) and in the proprietary pathway analysis tool and knowledge
      base Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Twitter has become one of the most popular social media platforms that
      offers real-world insights to healthy behaviors. The purpose of this study was to
      assess and compare perceptions about chemotherapy of patients and health-care
      providers through analysis of chemo-related tweets. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Cancer-related Twitter accounts and their tweets were obtained through using
      Tweepy (Python library). Multiple text classification algorithms were tested to
      identify the models with best performance in classifying the accounts into
      individual and organization. Chemotherapy-specific tweets were extracted from
      historical tweetset, and the content of these tweets was analyzed using topic
      model, sentiment analysis and word co-occurrence network. RESULTS: Using the
      description in Twitter users' profiles, the accounts related with cancer were
      collected and coded as individual or organization. We employed Long Short Term
      Memory (LSTM) network with GloVe word embeddings to identify the user into
      individuals and organizations with accuracy of 85.2%. 13, 273 and 14,051 publicly
      available chemotherapy-related tweets were retrieved from individuals and
      organizations, respectively. The content of the chemo-related tweets was analyzed
      by text mining approaches. The tweets from individual accounts pertained to
      personal chemotherapy experience and emotions. In contrast with the personal
      users, professional accounts had a higher proportion of neutral tweets about side
      effects. The information about the assessment of response to chemotherapy was
      deficient from organizations on Twitter. DISCUSSION: Examining chemotherapy
      discussions on Twitter provide new lens into content and behavioral patterns
      associated with treatments for cancer patients. The methodology described herein 
      allowed us to collect relatively large number of health-related tweets over a
      greater time period and exploit the potential power of social media, which
      provide comprehensive view on patients' perceptions of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: 
      This study sheds light on using Twitter data as a valuable healthcare data source
      for helping oncologists (organizations) in understanding patients' experiences
      while undergoing chemotherapy, in developing personalize therapy plans, and a
      supplement to the clinical electronic medical records (EMRs).

AB  - Recent progress in single-cell technologies has enabled the identification of all
      major cell types in mouse. However, for most cell types, the regulatory mechanism
      underlying their identity remains poorly understood. By computational analysis of
      the recently published mouse cell atlas data, we have identified 202 regulons
      whose activities are highly variable across different cell types, and more
      importantly, predicted a small set of essential regulators for each major cell
      type in mouse. Systematic validation by automated literature and data mining
      provides strong additional support for our predictions. Thus, these predictions
      serve as a valuable resource that would be useful for the broad biological
      community. Finally, we have built a user-friendly, interactive web portal to
      enable users to navigate this mouse cell network atlas.

TI  - Exploring Joint AB-LSTM with embedded lemmas for Adverse Drug Reaction discovery.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2879744 [doi]
AB  - This work focuses on the detection of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in Electronic
      Health Records (EHRs) written in Spanish. The World Health Organization
      underlines the importance of reporting ADRs for patients' safety. The fact is
      that ADRs tend to be under-reported in daily hospital praxis. In this context,
      automatic solutions based on text mining can help to alleviate the workload of
      experts. Nevertheless, these solutions pose two challenges: 1) EHRs show high
      lexical variability, the characterization of the events must be able to deal with
      unseen words or contexts and 2) ADRs are rare events, hence, the system should be
      robust against skewed class distribution. To tackle these challenges deep neural 
      networks seem appropriate because they allow a high-level representation.
      Specifically, we opted for a Joint AB-LSTM network, a sub-class of the
      Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network. Besides, in an attempt to reinforce
      lexical variability we proposed the use of embeddings created using lemmas. We
      compared this approach with supervised event extraction approaches based on
      either symbolic or dense representations. Experimental results showed that the
      Joint AB-LSTM approach outperformed previous approaches, achieving an f-measure
      of 73.3.

TI  - Systematic analysis of breast atypical hyperplasia-associated hub genes and
      pathways based on text mining.
LID - 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000494 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe breast atypical hyperplasia
      (BAH)-related gene expression and to systematically analyze the functions,
      pathways, and networks of BAH-related hub genes. On the basis of natural language
      processing, gene data for BAH were extracted from the PubMed database using text 
      mining. The enriched Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
      Genomes pathways were obtained using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). A
      protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database.
      Hub genes were identified as genes that interact with at least 10 other genes
      within the BAH-related gene network. In total, 138 BAH-associated genes were
      identified as significant (P<0.05), and 133 pathways were identified as
      significant (P<0.05, false discovery rate<0.05). A BAH-related protein network
      that included 81 interactions was constructed. Twenty genes were determined to
      interact with at least 10 others (P<0.05, false discovery rate<0.05) and were
      identified as the BAH-related hub genes of this protein-protein interaction
      network. These 20 genes are TP53, PIK3CA, JUN, MYC, EGFR, CCND1, AKT1, ERBB2,
      CTNN1B, ESR1, IGF-1, VEGFA, HRAS, CDKN1B, CDKN1A,PCNA, HGF, HIF1A, RB1, and
      STAT5A. This study may help to disclose the molecular mechanisms of BAH
      development and provide implications for BAH-targeted therapy or even breast
      cancer prevention. Nevertheless, connections between certain genes and BAH
      require further exploration.This is an open-access article distributed under the

AB  - This paper uses text data mining to identify long-term developments in tourism
      academic research from the perspectives of thematic focus, geography, and gender 
      of tourism authorship. Abstracts of papers published in the period of 1970-2017
      in high-ranking tourist journals were extracted from the Scopus database and
      served as data source for the analysis. Fourteen subject areas were identified
      using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) text mining approach. LDA integrated 
      with GIS information allowed to obtain geography distribution and trends of
      scholarly output, while probabilistic methods of gender identification based on
      social network data mining were used to track gender dynamics with sufficient
      confidence. The findings indicate that, while all 14 topics have been prominent
      from the inception of tourism studies to the present day, the geography of
      scholarship has notably expanded and the share of female authorship has increased
      through time and currently almost equals that of male authorship.

TI  - The anticancer mechanism investigation of Tanshinone IIA by pharmacological
      clustering in protein network.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1186/s12918-018-0606-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer is the second most common cause of death globally. The
      anticancer effects of Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) has been confirmed by numerous
      researches. However, the underlying mechanism remained to be integrated in
      systematic format. Systems biology embraced the complexity of cancer; therefore, 
      a system study approach was proposed in the present study to explore the
      anticancer mechanism of Tan IIA based on network pharmacology. METHOD: Agilent
      Literature Search (ALS), a text-mining tool, was used to pull protein targets of 
      Tan IIA. Then, pharmacological clustering was applied to classify obtained hits, 
      the anticancer module was analysed further. The top ten essential nodes in the
      anticancer module were obtained by ClusterONE. Functional units in the anticancer
      module were catalogued and validated by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Meanwhile,
      KEGG and Cell Signalling Technology Pathway were employed to provide pathway data
      for potential anticancer pathways construction. Finally, the pathways were
      plotted using Cytoscape 3.5.1. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with five
      carcinoma cell lines were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 258 proteins regulated
      by Tan IIA were identified through ALS and were visualized by protein network.
      Pharmacological clustering further sorted 68 proteins that intimately involved in
      cancer pathogenesis based on Gene Ontology. Subsequently, pathways on anticancer 
      effect of Tan IIA were delineated. Five functional units were clarified according
      to literature: including regulation on apoptosis, proliferation, sustained
      angiogenesis, autophagic cell death, and cell cycle. The GO analysis confirmed
      the classification was statistically significant. The inhibiting influence of Tan
      IIA on p70 S6K/mTOR pathway was revealed for the first time. The in vitro
      experiments displayed the selectivity of Tan IIA on HeLa, MDA-MB-231, HepG2,
      A549, and ACHN cell lines, the IC50 values were 0.54 muM, 4.63 muM, 1.42 muM,
      17.30 muM and 204.00 muM, respectively. This result further reinforced the
      anticancer effect of Tan IIA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides a
      systematic methodology for discovering the coordination of the anticancer
      pathways regulated by Tan IIA via protein network. And it also offers a valuable 
      guidance for systematic study on the therapeutic values of other herbs and their 
      active compounds.

TI  - User Testing an Information Foraging Tool for Ambulatory Surgical Site Infection 
      Surveillance.
PG  - 791-802
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1675179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance for surgical site infections (SSIs) after ambulatory
      surgery in children requires a detailed manual chart review to assess criteria
      defined by the National Health and Safety Network (NHSN). Electronic health
      records (EHRs) impose an inefficient search process where infection
      preventionists must manually review every postsurgical encounter (< 30 days).
      Using text mining and business intelligence software, we developed an information
      foraging application, the SSI Workbench, to visually present which postsurgical
      encounters included SSI-related terms and synonyms, antibiotic, and culture
      orders. OBJECTIVE: This article compares the Workbench and EHR on four
      dimensions: (1) effectiveness, (2) efficiency, (3) workload, and (4) usability.
      METHODS: Comparative usability test of Workbench and EHR. Objective test metrics 
      are time per case, encounters reviewed per case, time per encounter, and
      retrieval of information meeting NHSN definitions. Subjective measures are
      cognitive load using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
      Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and a questionnaire on system usability and utility. 
      RESULTS: Eight infection preventionists participated in the test. There was no
      difference in effectiveness as subjects retrieved information from all cases,
      using both systems, to meet the NHSN criteria. There was no difference in
      efficiency in time per case between the Workbench and EHR (8.58 vs. 7.39 minutes,
      p = 0.36). However, with the Workbench subjects opened fewer encounters per case 
      (3.0 vs. 7.5, p = 0.002), spent more time per encounter (2.23 vs. 0.92 minutes, p
      = 0.002), rated the Workbench lower in cognitive load (NASA TLX, 24 vs. 33, p =
      0.02), and significantly higher in measures of usability. CONCLUSION: Compared
      with the EHR, the Workbench was more usable, short, and reduced cognitive load.
      In overall efficiency, the Workbench did not save time, but demonstrated a shift 
      from between-encounter foraging to within-encounter foraging and was rated as
      significantly more efficient. Our results suggest that infection surveillance can
      be better supported by systems applying information foraging theory.

TI  - Identification of Primary Medication Concerns Regarding Thyroid Hormone
      Replacement Therapy From Online Patient Medication Reviews: Text Mining of Social
      Network Data.
PG  - e11085
LID - 10.2196/11085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with hypothyroidism report poor health-related quality of
      life despite having undergone thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT).
      Understanding patient concerns regarding levothyroxine can help improve the
      treatment outcomes of THRT. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) identify the
      distinctive themes in patient concerns regarding THRT, (2) determine whether
      patients have unique primary medication concerns specific to their demographics, 
      and (3) determine the predictability of primary medication concerns on patient
      treatment satisfaction. METHODS: We collected patient reviews from WebMD in the
      United States (1037 reviews about generic levothyroxine and 1075 reviews about
      the brand version) posted between September 1, 2007, and January 30, 2017. We
      used natural language processing to identify the themes of medication concerns.
      Multiple regression analyses were conducted in order to examine the
      predictability of the primary medication concerns on patient treatment
      satisfaction. RESULTS: Natural language processing of the patient reviews of
      levothyroxine posted on a social networking site produced 6 distinctive themes of
      patient medication concerns related to levothyroxine treatment: how to take the
      drug, treatment initiation, dose adjustment, symptoms of pain, generic
      substitutability, and appearance. Patients had different primary medication
      concerns unique to their gender, age, and treatment duration. Furthermore,
      treatment satisfaction on levothyroxine depended on what primary medication
      concerns the patient had. CONCLUSIONS: Natural language processing of text
      content available on social media could identify different themes of patient
      medication concerns that can be validated in future studies to inform the design 
      of tailored medication counseling for improved patient treatment satisfaction.

TI  - Discussions of Alcohol Use in an Online Social Network for Smoking Cessation:
      Analysis of Topics, Sentiment, and Social Network Centrality.
PG  - 108-114
LID - 10.1111/acer.13906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few Internet smoking cessation programs specifically address the
      impact of alcohol use during a quit attempt, despite its common role in relapse. 
      This study used topic modeling to describe the most prevalent topics about
      alcohol in an online smoking cessation community, the prevalence of negative
      sentiment expressed about alcohol use in the context of a quit attempt (i.e.,
      alcohol should be limited or avoided during a quit attempt) within topics, and
      the degree to which topics differed by user social connectivity within the
      network. METHODS: Data were analyzed from posts from the online community of a
      larger Internet cessation program, spanning January 1, 2012 to May 31, 2015 and
      included records of 814,258 online posts. Posts containing alcohol-related
      content (n = 7,199) were coded via supervised machine learning text
      classification to determine whether the post expressed negative sentiment about
      drinking in the context of a quit attempt. Correlated topic modeling (CTM) was
      used to identify a set of 10 topics of at least 1% prevalence based on the
      frequency of word occurrences among alcohol-related posts; the distribution of
      negative sentiment and user social network connectivity was examined across the
      most salient topics. RESULTS: Three salient topics (with prevalence >/=10%)
      emerged from the CTM, with distinct themes of (i) cravings and temptations; (ii) 
      parallel between nicotine addiction and alcoholism; and (iii) celebratory
      discussions of quit milestones including "virtual" alcohol use and toasts. Most
      topics skewed toward nonnegative sentiment about alcohol. The prevalence of each 
      topic differed by users' social connectivity in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Future 
      work should examine whether outcomes in Internet interventions are improved by
      tailoring social network content to match user characteristics, topics, and
      network behavior.

TI  - New approaches to pharmacosurveillance for monitoring prescription frequency,
      diversity, and co-prescription in a large sentinel network of companion animal
      veterinary practices in the United Kingdom, 2014-2016.
PG  - 153-161

AB  - Pharmaceutical agents (PAs) are commonly prescribed in companion animal practice 
      in the United Kingdom. However, little is known about PA prescription on a
      population-level, particularly with respect to PAs authorised for human use alone
      prescribed via the veterinary cascade; this raises important questions regarding 
      the efficacy and safety of PAs prescribed to companion animals. This study
      explored new approaches for describing PA prescription, diversity and
      co-prescription in dogs, cats and rabbits utilising electronic health records
      (EHRs) from a sentinel network of 457 companion animal-treating veterinary sites 
      throughout the UK over a 2-year period (2014-2016). A novel text mining-based
      identification and classification methodology was utilised to semi-automatically 
      map practitioner-defined product descriptions recorded in 918,333 EHRs from
      413,870 dogs encompassing 1,242,270 prescriptions; 352,730 EHRs from 200,541 cats
      encompassing 491,554 prescriptions, and 22,526 EHRS from 13,398 rabbits
      encompassing 18,490 prescriptions respectively. PA prescription as a percentage
      of booked consultations was 65.4% (95% confidence interval, CI, 64.6-66.3) in
      dogs; in cats it was 69.1% (95% CI, 67.9-70.2) and in rabbits, 56.3% (95% CI,
      54.7-57.8). Vaccines were the most commonly prescribed PAs in all three species, 
      with antibiotics, antimycotics, and parasiticides also commonly prescribed. PA
      prescription utilising products authorised for human use only (hence,
      'human-authorised') comprised 5.1% (95% CI, 4.7-5.5) of total canine prescription
      events; in cats it was 2.8% (95% CI, 2.6-3.0), and in rabbits, 7.8% (95% CI,
      6.5-9.0). The most commonly prescribed human-authorised PA in dogs was
      metronidazole (antibiotic); in cats and rabbits it was ranitidine (H2 histamine
      receptor antagonist). Using a new approach utilising the Simpson's Diversity
      Index (an ecological measure of relative animal, plant etc. species abundance),
      we identified differences in prescription based on presenting complaint and
      species, with rabbits generally exposed to a less diverse range of PAs than dogs 
      or cats, potentially reflecting the paucity of authorised PAs for use in rabbits.
      Finally, through a novel application of network analysis, we demonstrated the
      existence of three major co-prescription groups (preventive health; treatment of 
      disease, and euthanasia); a trend commonly observed in practice. This study
      represents the first time PA prescription has been described across all
      pharmaceutical families in a large population of companion animals, encompassing 
      PAs authorised for both veterinary and human-only use. These data form a baseline
      against which future studies could be compared, and provides some useful tools
      for understanding PA comparative efficacy and risks when prescribed in the varied
      setting of clinical practice.

TI  - Utilization of Electronic Medical Records and Biomedical Literature to Support
      the Diagnosis of Rare Diseases Using Data Fusion and Collaborative Filtering
      Approaches.
PG  - e11301
LID - 10.2196/11301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the United States, a rare disease is characterized as the one
      affecting no more than 200,000 patients at a certain period. Patients suffering
      from rare diseases are often either misdiagnosed or left undiagnosed, possibly
      due to insufficient knowledge or experience with the rare disease on the part of 
      clinical practitioners. With an exponentially growing volume of electronically
      accessible medical data, a large volume of information on thousands of rare
      diseases and their potentially associated diagnostic information is buried in
      electronic medical records (EMRs) and medical literature. OBJECTIVE: This study
      aimed to leverage information contained in heterogeneous datasets to assist rare 
      disease diagnosis. Phenotypic information of patients existed in EMRs and
      biomedical literature could be fully leveraged to speed up diagnosis of diseases.
      METHODS: In our previous work, we advanced the use of a collaborative filtering
      recommendation system to support rare disease diagnostic decision making based on
      phenotypes derived solely from EMR data. However, the influence of using
      heterogeneous data with collaborative filtering was not discussed, which is an
      essential problem while facing large volumes of data from various resources. In
      this study, to further investigate the performance of collaborative filtering on 
      heterogeneous datasets, we studied EMR data generated at Mayo Clinic as well as
      published article abstracts retrieved from the Semantic MEDLINE Database.
      Specifically, in this study, we designed different data fusion strategies from
      heterogeneous resources and integrated them with the collaborative filtering
      model. RESULTS: We evaluated performance of the proposed system using
      characterizations derived from various combinations of EMR data and literature,
      as well as with sole EMR data. We extracted nearly 13 million EMRs from the
      patient cohort generated between 2010 and 2015 at Mayo Clinic and retrieved all
      article abstracts from the semistructured Semantic MEDLINE Database that were
      published till the end of 2016. We applied a collaborative filtering model and
      compared the performance generated by different metrics. Log likelihood ratio
      similarity combined with k-nearest neighbor on heterogeneous datasets showed the 
      optimal performance in patient recommendation with area under the
      precision-recall curve (PRAUC) 0.475 (string match), 0.511 (systematized
      nomenclature of medicine [SNOMED] match), and 0.752 (Genetic and Rare Diseases
      Information Center [GARD] match). Log likelihood ratio similarity also performed 
      the best with mean average precision 0.465 (string match), 0.5 (SNOMED match),
      and 0.749 (GARD match). Performance of rare disease prediction was also
      demonstrated by using the optimal algorithm. Macro-average F-measure for string, 
      SNOMED, and GARD match were 0.32, 0.42, and 0.63, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study demonstrated potential utilization of heterogeneous datasets in a
      collaborative filtering model to support rare disease diagnosis. In addition to
      phenotypic-based analysis, in the future, we plan to further resolve the
      heterogeneity issue and reduce miscommunication between EMR and literature by
      mining genotypic information to establish a comprehensive disease-phenotype-gene 
      network for rare disease diagnosis.

TI  - Extracting chemical-protein relations using attention-based neural networks.
LID - 10.1093/database/bay102 [doi]
AB  - Relation extraction is an important task in the field of natural language
      processing. In this paper, we describe our approach for the BioCreative VI Task
      5: text mining chemical-protein interactions. We investigate multiple deep neural
      network (DNN) models, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural
      networks (RNNs) and attention-based (ATT-) RNNs (ATT-RNNs) to extract
      chemical-protein relations. Our experimental results indicate that ATT-RNN models
      outperform the same models without using attention and the ATT-gated recurrent
      unit (ATT-GRU) achieves the best performing micro average F1 score of 0.527 on
      the test set among the tested DNNs. In addition, the result of word-level
      attention weights also shows that attention mechanism is effective on selecting
      the most important trigger words when trained with semantic relation labels
      without the need of semantic parsing and feature engineering. The source code of

TI  - Twitter-Based Influenza Detection After Flu Peak via Tweets With Indirect
      Information: Text Mining Study.
PG  - e65
LID - 10.2196/publichealth.8627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent rise in popularity and scale of social networking services
      (SNSs) has resulted in an increasing need for SNS-based information extraction
      systems. A popular application of SNS data is health surveillance for predicting 
      an outbreak of epidemics by detecting diseases from text messages posted on SNS
      platforms. Such applications share the following logic: they incorporate SNS
      users as social sensors. These social sensor-based approaches also share a common
      problem: SNS-based surveillance are much more reliable if sufficient numbers of
      users are active, and small or inactive populations produce inconsistent results.
      OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a novel approach to estimate the trend of patient 
      numbers using indirect information covering both urban areas and rural areas
      within the posts. METHODS: We presented a TRAP model by embedding both direct
      information and indirect information. A collection of tweets spanning 3 years (7 
      million influenza-related tweets in Japanese) was used to evaluate the model.
      Both direct information and indirect information that mention other places were
      used. As indirect information is less reliable (too noisy or too old) than direct
      information, the indirect information data were not used directly and were
      considered as inhibiting direct information. For example, when indirect
      information appeared often, it was considered as signifying that everyone already
      had a known disease, leading to a small amount of direct information. RESULTS:
      The estimation performance of our approach was evaluated using the correlation
      coefficient between the number of influenza cases as the gold standard values and
      the estimated values by the proposed models. The results revealed that the
      baseline model (BASELINE+NLP) shows .36 and that the proposed model (TRAP+NLP)
      improved the accuracy (.70, +.34 points). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach by
      which the indirect information inhibits direct information exhibited improved
      estimation performance not only in rural cities but also in urban cities, which
      demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method consisting of a TRAP model 
      and natural language processing (NLP) classification.

TI  - Trends in deqi research: a text mining and network analysis.
PG  - 231-237
LID - 10.1016/j.imr.2018.02.007 [doi]
AB  - Background: Deqi is a term describing a special state of the human body, which is
      ready to cure itself through acupuncture stimulation and is believed to be a key 
      factor in acupuncture treatment. However, knowledge about deqi remains
      subjective. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the factors related
      to deqi generation based on present studies to promote the progression of deqi
      research. Methods: A term frequency-inverse document frequency (Tf-idf) was used 
      to extract key elements from the abstracts of 148 articles searched from Pubmed, 
      and the network structure between key elements was analyzed. Results: A total of 
      37 items were extracted from the abstracts. Each item was categorized into one of
      three groups (acupuncture-related sensation, interventions or organ/mechanism).
      Acupuncture-related sensation was studied by comparing the items in the
      interventions group with the organ/mechanism group. Key elements related to deqi 
      generation included muscles from the organ/mechanism group and intensity, depth
      and pressure from the interventions group. Items that belonged to the
      acupuncture-related sensation group were divided into two clusters: one cluster
      consisted of pain, tingling, aching, soreness, heaviness, fullness and numbness; 
      the other included warm, cold and dull. Conclusion: We could find out that the
      trend of deqi was leaning towards the interventions group, which related to the
      generation of deqi; thus, authors concluded that the mechanism studies, which are
      aimed to investigate why deqi is generated or what kind of meanings it has, are
      needed for evolution of acupuncture theory and application of the brand new
      technologies and related devices.

AB  - Autoimmune diseases (ADs) arise from an abnormal immune response of the body
      against substances and tissues normally present in the body. More than a hundred 
      of ADs have been described in the literature so far. Although their etiology
      remains largely unclear, various types of ADs tend to share more associated genes
      with other types of ADs than with non-AD types. Here we present GAAD, a gene and 
      AD association database. In GAAD, we collected 44,762 associations between 49 ADs
      and 4249 genes from public databases and MEDLINE documents. We manually verified 
      the associations to ensure the quality and credibility. We reconstructed and
      recapitulated the relationships among ADs using their shared genes, which further
      validated the quality of our data. We also provided a list of significantly
      co-occurring gene pairs among ADs; with embedded tools, users can query gene
      co-occurrences and construct customized co-occurrence network with genes of
      interest. To make GAAD more straightforward to experimental biologists and
      medical scientists, we extracted additional information describing the
      associations through text mining, including the putative diagnostic value of the 
      associations, type and position of gene polymorphisms, expression changes of
      implicated genes, as well as the phenotypical consequences, and grouped the
      associations accordingly. GAAD is freely available at http://gaad.medgenius.info.

AB  - Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a curious bottleneck in cancer research and
      chemotherapy, whereby some cells rapidly adapt to the tumor microenvironment via 
      a myriad of heterogeneous metabolic activities. Despite being a major impediment 
      to treatment, there is a silver lining: control over metabolic regulation could
      be an effective approach to overcome or correct resistance pathways. In this
      critical review, we comprehensively and carefully curated and analyzed large
      networks of previously identified proteins associated with metabolic adaptation
      in MDR. We employed data and text mining to study and categorize more than 600
      studies in PubMed, with particular focus on AMPK, a central and fundamental
      modulator in the energy metabolism network that has been specifically implicated 
      in cancer MDR pathways. We have identified one protein set of metabolic
      adaptations with 137 members closely related to cancer MDR processes, and a
      second protein set with 165 members derived from AMPK-based networks, with 28
      proteins found at the intersection between the two sets. Furthermore, according
      to genomics analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) provisional data, the
      highest alteration frequency (80.0%) of the genes encoding the intersected
      proteins (28 proteins), ranked three cancer types with quite remarkable
      significance across 166 studies. The hierarchical relationships of the entire
      identified gene and protein networks indicate broad correlations in AMPK-mediated
      metabolic regulation pathways, which we use decipher and depict the metabolic
      roles of AMPK and demonstrate the potential of metabolic control for therapeutic 
      intervention in MDR.

TI  - A document level neural model integrated domain knowledge for chemical-induced
      disease relations.
PG  - 328
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2316-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effective combination of texts and knowledge may improve
      performances of natural language processing tasks. For the recognition of
      chemical-induced disease (CID) relations which may span sentence boundaries in an
      article, although existing CID systems explored the utilization for knowledge
      bases, the effects of different knowledge on the identification of a special CID 
      haven't been distinguished by these systems. Moreover, systems based on neural
      network only constructed sentence or mention level models. RESULTS: In this work,
      we proposed an effective document level neural model integrated domain knowledge 
      to extract CID relations from biomedical articles. Basic semantic information of 
      an article with respect to a special CID candidate pair was learned from the
      document level sub-network module. Furthermore, knowledge attention depending on 
      the representation of the article was proposed to distinguish the influences of
      different knowledge on the special CID pair and then the final representation of 
      knowledge was formed by aggregating weighed knowledge. Finally, the integrated
      representations of texts and knowledge were passed to a softmax classifier to
      perform the CID recognition. Experimental results on the chemical-disease
      relation corpus proposed by BioCreative V show that our proposed system
      integrated knowledge achieves a good overall performance compared with other
      state-of-the-art systems. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental analyses demonstrate that the
      introduced attention mechanism on domain knowledge plays a significant role in
      distinguishing influences of different knowledge on the judgment for a special
      CID relation.

TI  - Identification of differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways using
      bioinformatics in interstitial lung disease due to tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor.

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rare but lethal adverse effect of epidermal 
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment. The
      specific mechanism of this disease is not fully understood. To systematically
      analyze genes associated with EGFR-TKI induced ILD, gene data of EGFR-TKI induced
      ILD were extracted initially using text mining, and then the intersection between
      genes from text mining and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset was taken for
      further protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis using String-bd database. Go
      ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis was also conducted based on
      Database of Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) platform. 
      The PPI network generated by STRING was visualized by Cytoscape, and the topology
      scores, functional regions and gene annotations were analyzed using plugins of
      CytoNCA, molecular complex detection (MCODE) and ClueGo. 37 genes were identified
      as EGFR-TKI induced ILD related. Gene enrichment analysis yield 18 enriched GO
      terms and 12 associated pathways. A PPI network that included 199 interactions
      for a total of 35 genes was constructed. Ten genes were selected as hub genes
      using CytoNCA plugin, and four highly connected clusters were identified using
      MCODE plugin. GO and pathway annotation analysis for the cluster one revealed
      that five genes were associated with either response to dexamethasone or with
      lung fibrosis, including CTGF, CCL2, IGF1, EGFR and ICAM1. Our data might be
      useful to reveal the pathological mechanisms of EGFR-TKI induced ILD and provide 
      evidence for the diagnosis and treatment in the future.

TI  - A set of domain rules and a deep network for protein coreference resolution.
LID - 10.1093/database/bay065 [doi]
AB  - Current research of bio-text mining mainly focuses on event extractions.
      Biological networks present much richer and meaningful information to biologists 
      than events. Bio-entity coreference resolution (CR) is a very important method to
      complete a bio-event's attributes and interconnect events into bio-networks.
      Though general CR methods have been studies for a long time, they could not
      produce a practically useful result when applied to a special domain. Therefore, 
      bio-entity CR needs attention to better assist biological network extraction. In 
      this article, we present two methods for bio-entity CR. The first is a rule-based
      method, which creates a set of syntactic rules or semantic constraints for CR. It
      obtains a state-of-the-art performance (an F1-score of 62.0%) on the community
      supported dataset. We also present a machine learning-based method, which takes
      use of a recurrent neural network model, a long-short term memory network. It
      automatically learns global discriminative representations of all kinds of
      coreferences without hand-crafted features. The model outperforms the previously 
      best machine leaning-based method.

TI  - A deep learning approach to bilingual lexicon induction in the biomedical domain.
PG  - 259
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2245-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) is an important task in the
      biomedical domain as translation resources are usually available for general
      language usage, but are often lacking in domain-specific settings. In this
      article we consider BLI as a classification problem and train a neural network
      composed of a combination of recurrent long short-term memory and deep
      feed-forward networks in order to obtain word-level and character-level
      representations. RESULTS: The results show that the word-level and
      character-level representations each improve state-of-the-art results for BLI and
      biomedical translation mining. The best results are obtained by exploiting the
      synergy between these word-level and character-level representations in the
      classification model. We evaluate the models both quantitatively and
      qualitatively. CONCLUSIONS: Translation of domain-specific biomedical terminology
      benefits from the character-level representations compared to relying solely on
      word-level representations. It is beneficial to take a deep learning approach and
      learn character-level representations rather than relying on handcrafted
      representations that are typically used. Our combined model captures the
      semantics at the word level while also taking into account that specialized
      terminology often originates from a common root form (e.g., from Greek or Latin).

TI  - Trends in the development of miRNA bioinformatics tools.
LID - 10.1093/bib/bby054 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression via
      recognition of cognate sequences and interference of transcriptional,
      translational or epigenetic processes. Bioinformatics tools developed for miRNA
      study include those for miRNA prediction and discovery, structure, analysis and
      target prediction. We manually curated 95 review papers and approximately 1000
      miRNA bioinformatics tools published since 2003. We classified and ranked them
      based on citation number or PageRank score, and then performed network analysis
      and text mining (TM) to study the miRNA tools development trends. Five key trends
      were observed: (1) miRNA identification and target prediction have been hot spots
      in the past decade; (2) manual curation and TM are the main methods for
      collecting miRNA knowledge from literature; (3) most early tools are well
      maintained and widely used; (4) classic machine learning methods retain their
      utility; however, novel ones have begun to emerge; (5) disease-associated miRNA
      tools are emerging. Our analysis yields significant insight into the past
      development and future directions of miRNA tools.

TI  - Using data-driven sublanguage pattern mining to induce knowledge models:
      application in medical image reports knowledge representation.
PG  - 61
LID - 10.1186/s12911-018-0645-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of knowledge models facilitates information retrieval,
      knowledge base development, and therefore supports new knowledge discovery that
      ultimately enables decision support applications. Most existing works have
      employed machine learning techniques to construct a knowledge base. However, they
      often suffer from low precision in extracting entity and relationships. In this
      paper, we described a data-driven sublanguage pattern mining method that can be
      used to create a knowledge model. We combined natural language processing (NLP)
      and semantic network analysis in our model generation pipeline. METHODS: As a use
      case of our pipeline, we utilized data from an open source imaging case
      repository, Radiopaedia.org , to generate a knowledge model that represents the
      contents of medical imaging reports. We extracted entities and relationships
      using the Stanford part-of-speech parser and the "Subject:Relationship:Object"
      syntactic data schema. The identified noun phrases were tagged with the Unified
      Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic types. An evaluation was done on a
      dataset comprised of 83 image notes from four data sources. RESULTS: A semantic
      type network was built based on the co-occurrence of 135 UMLS semantic types in
      23,410 medical image reports. By regrouping the semantic types and generalizing
      the semantic network, we created a knowledge model that contains 14 semantic
      categories. Our knowledge model was able to cover 98% of the content in the
      evaluation corpus and revealed 97% of the relationships. Machine annotation
      achieved a precision of 87%, recall of 79%, and F-score of 82%. CONCLUSION: The
      results indicated that our pipeline was able to produce a comprehensive
      content-based knowledge model that could represent context from various sources
      in the same domain.

TI  - Chemical-gene relation extraction using recursive neural network.
LID - 10.1093/database/bay060 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we describe our system for the CHEMPROT task of the BioCreative 
      VI challenge. Although considerable research on the named entity recognition of
      genes and drugs has been conducted, there is limited research on extracting
      relationships between them. Extracting relations between chemical compounds and
      genes from the literature is an important element in pharmacological and clinical
      research. The CHEMPROT task of BioCreative VI aims to promote the development of 
      text mining systems that can be used to automatically extract relationships
      between chemical compounds and genes. We tested three recursive neural network
      approaches to improve the performance of relation extraction. In the BioCreative 
      VI challenge, we developed a tree-Long Short-Term Memory networks (tree-LSTM)
      model with several additional features including a position feature and a subtree
      containment feature, and we also applied an ensemble method. After the challenge,
      we applied additional pre-processing steps to the tree-LSTM model, and we tested 
      the performance of another recursive neural network model called Stack-augmented 
      Parser Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN). Our tree-LSTM model achieved an
      F-score of 58.53% in the BioCreative VI challenge. Our tree-LSTM model with
      additional pre-processing and the SPINN model obtained F-scores of 63.7 and
      64.1%, respectively.Database URL:

AB  - Cytokines are signaling molecules secreted and sensed by immune and other cell
      types, enabling dynamic intercellular communication. Although a vast amount of
      data on these interactions exists, this information is not compiled, integrated
      or easily searchable. Here we report immuneXpresso, a text-mining engine that
      structures and standardizes knowledge of immune intercellular communication. We
      applied immuneXpresso to PubMed to identify relationships between 340 cell types 
      and 140 cytokines across thousands of diseases. The method is able to distinguish
      between incoming and outgoing interactions, and it includes the effect of the
      interaction and the cellular function involved. These factors are assigned a
      confidence score and linked to the disease. By leveraging the breadth of this
      network, we predicted and experimentally verified previously unappreciated
      cell-cytokine interactions. We also built a global immune-centric view of
      diseases and used it to predict cytokine-disease associations. This standardized 
      knowledgebase (http://www.immunexpresso.org) opens up new directions for
      interpretation of immune data and model-driven systems immunology.

LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2200-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systems biology is an important field for understanding whole
      biological mechanisms composed of interactions between biological components. One
      approach for understanding complex and diverse mechanisms is to analyze
      biological pathways. However, because these pathways consist of important
      interactions and information on these interactions is disseminated in a large
      number of biomedical reports, text-mining techniques are essential for extracting
      these relationships automatically. RESULTS: In this study, we applied node2vec,
      an algorithmic framework for feature learning in networks, for relationship
      extraction. To this end, we extracted genes from paper abstracts using pkde4j, a 
      text-mining tool for detecting entities and relationships. Using the extracted
      genes, a co-occurrence network was constructed and node2vec was used with the
      network to generate a latent representation. To demonstrate the efficacy of
      node2vec in extracting relationships between genes, performance was evaluated for
      gene-gene interactions involved in a type 2 diabetes pathway. Moreover, we
      compared the results of node2vec to those of baseline methods such as
      co-occurrence and DeepWalk. CONCLUSIONS: Node2vec outperformed existing methods
      in detecting relationships in the type 2 diabetes pathway, demonstrating that
      this method is appropriate for capturing the relatedness between pairs of
      biological entities involved in biological pathways. The results demonstrated
      that node2vec is useful for automatic pathway construction.

TI  - Identification of key genes in human airway epithelial cells in response to
      respiratory pathogens using microarray analysis.
PG  - 58
LID - 10.1186/s12866-018-1187-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway epithelium is the primary target for pathogens. It functions
      not only as a mechanical barrier, but also as an important sentinel of the innate
      immune system. However, the interactions and processes between host airway
      epithelium and pathogens are not fully understood. RESULTS: In this study, we
      identified responses of the human airway epithelium cells to respiratory pathogen
      infection. We retrieved three mRNA expression microarray datasets from the Gene
      Expression Omnibus database, and identified 116 differentially expressed genes
      common to all three datasets. Gene functional annotations were performed using
      Gene Ontology and pathway analyses. Using protein-protein interaction network
      analysis and text mining, we identified a subset of genes functioned as a group
      and associated with infection, inflammation, tissue adhesion, and receptor
      internalization in infected epithelial cells. These genes were further identified
      in BESE-2B cells in response to Talaromyces marneffei by Real-Time quantitative
      PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, we performed an in silico prediction of
      microRNA-target interactions and examined our findings. CONCLUSIONS: Using
      bioinformatics analysis, we identified several genes that may serve as biomarkers
      for the diagnosis or the surveillance of early respiratory tract infection, and
      identified additional genes and miRNAs that warrant further fundamental
      experimental research.

TI  - The Active Components of Fuzheng Huayu Formula and Their Potential Mechanism of
      Action in Inhibiting the Hepatic Stellate Cells Viability - A Network
      Pharmacology and Transcriptomics Approach.
PG  - 525
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2018.00525 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify the active components of Fuzheng Huayu
      (FZHY) formula and the mechanism by which they inhibit the viability of hepatic
      stellate cells (HSCs) by a combination of network pharmacology and
      transcriptomics. Methods: The active components of FZHY formula were screened out
      by text mining. Similarity match and molecular docking were used to predict the
      target proteins of these compounds. We then searched the STRING database to
      analyze the key enriched processes, pathways and related diseases of these target
      proteins. The relevant networks were constructed by Cytoscape. A network analysis
      method was established by integrating data from above network pharmacology with
      known transcriptomics analysis of quiescent HSCs-activated HSCs to identify the
      most possible targets of the active components in FZHY formula. A cell-based
      assay (LX-2 and T6 cells) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis were used 
      to validate the most possible active component-target protein interactions
      (CTPIs). Results: 40 active ingredients in FZHY formula and their 79 potential
      target proteins were identified by network pharmacology approach. Further network
      analysis reduced the 79 potential target proteins to 31, which were considered
      more likely to be the target proteins of the active components in FZHY formula.
      In addition, further enrichment analysis of 31 target proteins indicated that the
      HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, FoxO, and chemokine signaling pathways may be the primary
      pathways regulated by FZHY formula in inhibiting the HSCs viability for the
      treatment of liver fibrosis. Of the 31 target proteins, peroxisome proliferator
      activator receptor gamma (PPARG) was selected for validation by experiments at
      the cellular and molecular level. The results demonstrated that schisandrin B,
      salvianolic acid A and kaempferol could directly bind to PPARG, decreasing the
      viability of HSCs (T6 cells and LX-2 cells) and exerting anti-fibrosis effects.
      Conclusion: The active ingredients of FZHY formula were successfully identified
      and the mechanisms by which they inhibit HSC viability determined, using network 
      pharmacology and transcriptomics. This work is expected to benefit the clinical
      application of this formula.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug development for rare diseases is challenging because it is
      difficult to obtain relevant data from very few patients. It must be informative 
      to grasp current status of clinical trials for drug development in rare diseases.
      OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials in rare diseases are to be outlined and compared among
      the US, EU and Japan. METHOD: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT, National Clinical Trial), 
      EU Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) and the Japan Primary Registries Network
      (JPRN) were analyzed. Clinical trials involving information on rare diseases and 
      drugs were extracted by text-mining, based on the diseases and drugs derived from
      Orphanet and DrugBank, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 28,526 clinical trials
      were extracted, which studied 1,535 rare diseases and 1,539 drugs. NCT had the
      largest number of trials, involving 1,252 diseases and 1,332 drugs. EUCTR and
      JPRN also had registry-specific diseases (250 and 22, respectively) and drugs
      (172 and 29, respectively) that should not be missed. Among the 1,535 rare
      diseases, most diseases were studied in only a limited number of trials; 70% of
      diseases were studied in fewer than 10 trials, and 28% were studied in only one. 
      Additionally, most studied rare diseases were cancer-related ones. CONCLUSION:
      This study has revealed the characteristics of the clinical trials in rare
      diseases among the US, EU and Japan. The number of trials for rare diseases was
      limited especially for non-cancerrelated ones. This information could contribute 
      to drug development such as drug-repositioning in rare diseases.

PG  - 8440
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-26783-w [doi]
AB  - Chemotherapy agents can cause serious adverse effects by attacking both cancer
      tissues and normal tissues. Therefore, we proposed a synthetic lethality (SL)
      concept-based computational method to identify specific anticancer drug targets. 
      First, a 3-step screening strategy (network-based, frequency-based and
      function-based screening) was proposed to identify the SL gene pairs by mining
      697 cancer genes and the human signaling network, which had 6306 proteins and
      62937 protein-protein interactions. The network-based screening was composed of a
      stability score constructed using a network information centrality measure (the
      average shortest path length) and the distance-based screening between the cancer
      gene and the non-cancer gene. Then, the non-cancer genes were extracted and
      annotated using drug-target interaction and drug description information to
      obtain potential anticancer drug targets. Finally, the human SL data in
      SynLethDB, the existing drug sensitivity data and text-mining were utilized for
      target validation. We successfully identified 2555 SL gene pairs and 57 potential
      anticancer drug targets. Among them, CDK1, CDK2, PLK1 and WEE1 were verified by
      all three aspects and could be preferentially used in specific targeted therapy
      in the future.

TI  - A hybrid Neural Network Model for Joint Prediction of Presence and Period
      Assertions of Medical Events in Clinical Notes.
PG  - 1149-1158
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture for clinical text
      mining. We formulate this hybrid neural network model (HNN), composed of
      recurrent neural network and deep residual network, to jointly predict the
      presence and period assertion values associated with medical events in clinical
      texts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on a corpus of expert-annotated
      longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) notes from Cancer patients. Our
      experiments show that HNN improves the joint assertion classification accuracy as
      compared to conventional baselines.

TI  - Finding novel relationships with integrated gene-gene association network
      analysis of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 using species-independent text-mining.
PG  - e4806
LID - 10.7717/peerj.4806 [doi]
AB  - The increasing move towards open access full-text scientific literature enhances 
      our ability to utilize advanced text-mining methods to construct information-rich
      networks that no human will be able to grasp simply from 'reading the
      literature'. The utility of text-mining for well-studied species is obvious
      though the utility for less studied species, or those with no prior track-record 
      at all, is not clear. Here we present a concept for how advanced text-mining can 
      be used to create information-rich networks even for less well studied species
      and apply it to generate an open-access gene-gene association network resource
      for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a representative model organism for cyanobacteria
      and first case-study for the methodology. By merging the text-mining network with
      networks generated from species-specific experimental data, network integration
      was used to enhance the accuracy of predicting novel interactions that are
      biologically relevant. A rule-based algorithm (filter) was constructed in order
      to automate the search for novel candidate genes with a high degree of likely
      association to known target genes by (1) ignoring established relationships from 
      the existing literature, as they are already 'known', and (2) demanding multiple 
      independent evidences for every novel and potentially relevant relationship.
      Using selected case studies, we demonstrate the utility of the network resource
      and filter to (i) discover novel candidate associations between different genes
      or proteins in the network, and (ii) rapidly evaluate the potential role of any
      one particular gene or protein. The full network is provided as an open-source
      resource.

TI  - Putting hands to rest: efficient deep CNN-RNN architecture for chemical named
      entity recognition with no hand-crafted rules.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s13321-018-0280-0 [doi]
AB  - Chemical named entity recognition (NER) is an active field of research in
      biomedical natural language processing. To facilitate the development of new and 
      superior chemical NER systems, BioCreative released the CHEMDNER corpus, an
      extensive dataset of diverse manually annotated chemical entities. Most of the
      systems trained on the corpus rely on complicated hand-crafted rules or curated
      databases for data preprocessing, feature extraction and output post-processing, 
      though modern machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks, can
      automatically design the rules with little to none human intervention. Here we
      explored this approach by experimenting with various deep learning architectures 
      for targeted tokenisation and named entity recognition. Our final model, based on
      a combination of convolutional and stateful recurrent neural networks with
      attention-like loops and hybrid word- and character-level embeddings, reaches
      near human-level performance on the testing dataset with no manually asserted
      rules. To make our model easily accessible for standalone use and integration in 
      third-party software, we've developed a Python package with a minimalistic user
      interface.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Travel to elevations above 2500m is associated with
      the risk of developing one or more forms of acute altitude illness such as acute 
      mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) or high altitude
      pulmonary edema (HAPE). Our work aims to identify the functional association of
      genes involved in high altitude diseases. METHOD: In this work we identified the 
      gene networks responsible for high altitude diseases by using the principle of
      gene co-occurrence statistics from literature and network analysis. First, we
      mined the literature data from PubMed on high-altitude diseases, and extracted
      the co-occurring gene pairs. Next, based on their co-occurrence frequency, gene
      pairs were ranked. Finally, a gene association network was created using
      statistical measures to explore potential relationships. RESULTS: Network
      analysis results revealed that EPO, ACE, IL6 and TNF are the top five genes that 
      were found to co-occur with 20 or more genes, while the association between EPAS1
      and EGLN1 genes is strongly substantiated. CONCLUSION: The network constructed
      from this study proposes a large number of genes that work in-toto in high
      altitude conditions. Overall, the result provides a good reference for further
      study of the genetic relationships in high altitude diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: IDeAl (Integrated designs and analysis of small population clinical
      trials) is an EU funded project developing new statistical design and analysis
      methodologies for clinical trials in small population groups. Here we provide an 
      overview of IDeAl findings and give recommendations to applied researchers.
      METHOD: The description of the findings is broken down by the nine scientific
      IDeAl work packages and summarizes results from the project's more than 60
      publications to date in peer reviewed journals. In addition, we applied text
      mining to evaluate the publications and the IDeAl work packages' output in
      relation to the design and analysis terms derived from in the IRDiRC task force
      report on small population clinical trials. RESULTS: The results are summarized, 
      describing the developments from an applied viewpoint. The main result presented 
      here are 33 practical recommendations drawn from the work, giving researchers a
      comprehensive guidance to the improved methodology. In particular, the findings
      will help design and analyse efficient clinical trials in rare diseases with
      limited number of patients available. We developed a network representation
      relating the hot topics developed by the IRDiRC task force on small population
      clinical trials to IDeAl's work as well as relating important methodologies by
      IDeAl's definition necessary to consider in design and analysis of
      small-population clinical trials. These network representation establish a new
      perspective on design and analysis of small-population clinical trials.
      CONCLUSION: IDeAl has provided a huge number of options to refine the statistical
      methodology for small-population clinical trials from various perspectives. A
      total of 33 recommendations developed and related to the work packages help the
      researcher to design small population clinical trial. The route to improvements
      is displayed in IDeAl-network representing important statistical methodological
      skills necessary to design and analysis of small-population clinical trials. The 
      methods are ready for use.

TI  - How Artificial Intelligence Can Improve Our Understanding of the Genes Associated
      with Endometriosis: Natural Language Processing of the PubMed Database.
PG  - 6217812
LID - 10.1155/2018/6217812 [doi]
AB  - Endometriosis is a disease characterized by the development of endometrial tissue
      outside the uterus, but its cause remains largely unknown. Numerous genes have
      been studied and proposed to help explain its pathogenesis. However, the large
      number of these candidate genes has made functional validation through
      experimental methodologies nearly impossible. Computational methods could provide
      a useful alternative for prioritizing those most likely to be susceptibility
      genes. Using artificial intelligence applied to text mining, this study analyzed 
      the genes involved in the pathogenesis, development, and progression of
      endometriosis. The data extraction by text mining of the endometriosis-related
      genes in the PubMed database was based on natural language processing, and the
      data were filtered to remove false positives. Using data from the text mining and
      gene network information as input for the web-based tool, 15,207
      endometriosis-related genes were ranked according to their score in the database.
      Characterization of the filtered gene set through gene ontology, pathway, and
      network analysis provided information about the numerous mechanisms hypothesized 
      to be responsible for the establishment of ectopic endometrial tissue, as well as
      the migration, implantation, survival, and proliferation of ectopic endometrial
      cells. Finally, the human genome was scanned through various databases using
      filtered genes as a seed to determine novel genes that might also be involved in 
      the pathogenesis of endometriosis but which have not yet been characterized.
      These genes could be promising candidates to serve as useful diagnostic
      biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the management of endometriosis.

AB  - Since identifying relations between chemicals and diseases (CDR) are important
      for biomedical research and healthcare, the challenge proposed by BioCreative V
      requires automatically mining causal relationships between chemicals and diseases
      which may span sentence boundaries. Although most systems explore feature
      engineering and knowledge bases to recognize document level CDR relations,
      feature learning automatically is limited only in a sentence. In this work, we
      proposed an effective model that automatically learns document level semantic
      representations to extract chemical-induced disease (CID) relations from articles
      by combining advantages of convolutional neural network and recurrent neural
      network. First, to purposefully collect contexts, candidate entities existing in 
      multiple sentences of an article were masked to make the model have ability to
      discern candidate entities and general terms. Next, considering the contiguity
      and temporality among associated sentences as well as the topic of an article, a 
      hierarchical network architecture was designed at the document level to capture
      semantic information of different types of text segments in an article. Finally, 
      a softmax classifier performed the CID recognition. Experimental results on the
      CDR corpus show that the proposed model achieves a good overall performance
      compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Although only using two types of
      embedding vectors, our approach can perform well for recognizing not only
      intra-sentential but also inter-sentential CID relations.

TI  - Identifying diseases-related metabolites using random walk.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2098-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolites disrupted by abnormal state of human body are deemed as
      the effect of diseases. In comparison with the cause of diseases like genes,
      these markers are easier to be captured for the prevention and diagnosis of
      metabolic diseases. Currently, a large number of metabolic markers of diseases
      need to be explored, which drive us to do this work. METHODS: The existing
      metabolite-disease associations were extracted from Human Metabolome Database
      (HMDB) using a text mining tool NCBO annotator as priori knowledge. Next we
      calculated the similarity of a pair-wise metabolites based on the similarity of
      disease sets of them. Then, all the similarities of metabolite pairs were
      utilized for constructing a weighted metabolite association network (WMAN).
      Subsequently, the network was utilized for predicting novel metabolic markers of 
      diseases using random walk. RESULTS: Totally, 604 metabolites and 228 diseases
      were extracted from HMDB. From 604 metabolites, 453 metabolites are selected to
      construct the WMAN, where each metabolite is deemed as a node, and the similarity
      of two metabolites as the weight of the edge linking them. The performance of the
      network is validated using the leave one out method. As a result, the high area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.7048) is achieved. The
      further case studies for identifying novel metabolites of diabetes mellitus were 
      validated in the recent studies. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we presented a novel 
      method for prioritizing metabolite-disease pairs. The superior performance
      validates its reliability for exploring novel metabolic markers of diseases.

AB  - Blowfly strike is a devastating and often rapidly fatal disease in rabbits. In
      Great Britain (GB), Lucilia sericata is the primary causative species. Despite
      its severity, there has been minimal investigatory work into the disease in
      rabbits. Here we used text mining to screen electronic health records (EHRs) from
      a large sentinel network of 389 veterinary practices in GB between March 2014 and
      April 2017 for confirmed cases of blowfly strike in rabbits. Blowfly strike was
      identified in 243 of 42,226 rabbit consultations (0.6%), affecting 205 individual
      rabbits. The anatomical site of recorded blowfly strike lesions was
      overwhelmingly the perineal area (n=109, 52.4%). Less commonly lesions were
      observed affecting other areas of the body (n=9, 4.3%) and head (n=8, 3.8%); in
      83 consultations (39.9%), the affected area was not specified. Of the rabbits
      presenting with blowfly strike, 44.7% were recorded as being euthanized or died. 
      A case control study was used to identify risk factors for blowfly strike in this
      population. Whilst sex and neuter status in isolation were not significantly
      associated with blowfly strike, entire female rabbits showed a 3.3 times greater 
      odds of being a case than neutered female rabbits. Rabbits five years of age and 
      over were more than 3.8 times likely to present for blowfly strike. For every 1
      degrees C rise in environmental temperature between 4.67 degrees C and 17.68
      degrees C, there was a 33% increase risk of blowfly strike, with cases peaking in
      July or August. Overall blowfly strike cases started earlier and peaked higher in
      the south of Great Britain. The most northerly latitude studied was at lower risk
      of blowfly strike than the most southerly (OR=0.50, p<0.001). There appeared to
      be no significant relationship between blowfly strike in rabbits and either the
      sheep density or rural and urban land coverage types. The results presented here 
      can be used for targeted health messaging to reduce the impact of this deadly
      disease for rabbits. We propose that real-time temporal and spatial surveillance 
      of the rabbit disease may also help inform sheep control, where the seasonal
      profile is very similar, and where routine surveillance data is also not
      available. Our results highlight the value of sentinel databases based on EHRs
      for research and surveillance.

TI  - ParBiBit: Parallel tool for binary biclustering on modern distributed-memory
      systems.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0194361 [doi]
AB  - Biclustering techniques are gaining attention in the analysis of large-scale
      datasets as they identify two-dimensional submatrices where both rows and columns
      are correlated. In this work we present ParBiBit, a parallel tool to accelerate
      the search of interesting biclusters on binary datasets, which are very popular
      on different fields such as genetics, marketing or text mining. It is based on
      the state-of-the-art sequential Java tool BiBit, which has been proved accurate
      by several studies, especially on scenarios that result on many large biclusters.
      ParBiBit uses the same methodology as BiBit (grouping the binary information into
      patterns) and provides the same results. Nevertheless, our tool significantly
      improves performance thanks to an efficient implementation based on C++11 that
      includes support for threads and MPI processes in order to exploit the compute
      capabilities of modern distributed-memory systems, which provide several
      multicore CPU nodes interconnected through a network. Our performance evaluation 
      with 18 representative input datasets on two different eight-node systems shows
      that our tool is significantly faster than the original BiBit. Source code in C++
      and MPI running on Linux systems as well as a reference manual are available at
      https://sourceforge.net/projects/parbibit/.

AB  - Exponentially growing scientific knowledge in scientific publications has
      resulted in the emergence of a new interdisciplinary science of literature
      mining. In text mining, the machine reads the published literature and transfers 
      the discovered knowledge to mathematical-like formulas. In an integrative
      approach in this study, we used text mining in combination with network
      discovery, pathway analysis, and enrichment analysis of genomic regions for
      better understanding of biomarkers in lung cancer. Particular attention was paid 
      to non-coding biomarkers. In total, 60 MicroRNA biomarkers were reported for lung
      cancer, including some prognostic biomarkers. MIR21, MIR155, MALAT1, and MIR31
      were the top non-coding RNA biomarkers of lung cancer. Text mining identified 447
      proteins which have been studied as biomarkers in lung cancer. EGFR (receptor),
      TP53 (transcription factor), KRAS, CDKN2A, ENO2, KRT19, RASSF1, GRP (ligand),
      SHOX2 (transcription factor), and ERBB2 (receptor) were the most studied

AB  - The role of genetic components in cancer development is an area of interest for
      cancer biologists in general. Intriguingly, some genes have both oncogenic and
      tumor-suppressor functions. In this study, we systematically identified these
      genes through database search and text mining. We find that most of them are
      transcription factors or kinases and exhibit dual biological functions, e.g.,
      that they both positively and negatively regulate transcription in cells. Some
      cancer types such as leukemia are over-represented by them, whereas some common
      cancer types such as lung cancer are under-represented by them. Across 12 major
      cancer types, while their genomic mutation patterns are similar to that of
      oncogenes, their expression patterns are more similar to that of tumor-suppressor
      genes. Their expression profile in six human organs propose that they mainly
      function as tumor suppressor in normal tissue. Our network analyses further show 
      they have higher network degrees than both oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes
      and thus tend to be the hub genes in the protein-protein interaction network. Our
      mutation, expression spectrum, and network analyses might help explain why some
      cancer types are specifically associated with them. Finally, our results suggest 
      that the functionally altering mutations in "double-agent" genes and oncogenes
      are the main driving force in cancer development, because non-silent mutations
      are biasedly distributed toward these two gene sets across all 12 major cancer
      types.

AB  - We address the assignment of ICD-10 codes for causes of death by analyzing
      free-text descriptions in death certificates, together with the associated
      autopsy reports and clinical bulletins, from the Portuguese Ministry of Health.
      We leverage a deep neural network that combines word embeddings, recurrent units,
      and neural attention, for the generation of intermediate representations of the
      textual contents. The neural network also explores the hierarchical nature of the
      input data, by building representations from the sequences of words within
      individual fields, which are then combined according to the sequences of fields
      that compose the inputs. Moreover, we explore innovative mechanisms for
      initializing the weights of the final nodes of the network, leveraging
      co-occurrences between classes together with the hierarchical structure of
      ICD-10. Experimental results attest to the contribution of the different neural
      network components. Our best model achieves accuracy scores over 89%, 81%, and
      76%, respectively for ICD-10 chapters, blocks, and full-codes. Through examples, 
      we also show that our method can produce interpretable results, useful for public
      health surveillance.

TI  - Text mining-based in silico drug discovery in oral mucositis caused by high-dose 
      cancer therapy.
PG  - 2695-2705
LID - 10.1007/s00520-018-4096-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oral mucositis (OM) is a major dose-limiting side effect of
      chemotherapy and radiation used in cancer treatment. Due to the complex nature of
      OM, currently available drug-based treatments are of limited efficacy.
      OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were (i) to determine genes and molecular pathways
      associated with OM and wound healing using computational tools and publicly
      available data and (ii) to identify drugs formulated for topical use targeting
      the relevant OM molecular pathways. METHODS: OM and wound healing-associated
      genes were determined by text mining, and the intersection of the two gene sets
      was selected for gene ontology analysis using the GeneCodis program. Protein
      interaction network analysis was performed using STRING-db. Enriched gene sets
      belonging to the identified pathways were queried against the Drug-Gene
      Interaction database to find drug candidates for topical use in OM. RESULTS: Our 
      analysis identified 447 genes common to both the "OM" and "wound healing" text
      mining concepts. Gene enrichment analysis yielded 20 genes representing six
      pathways and targetable by a total of 32 drugs which could possibly be formulated
      for topical application. A manual search on ClinicalTrials.gov confirmed no
      relevant pathway/drug candidate had been overlooked. Twenty-five of the 32 drugs 
      can directly affect the PTGS2 (COX-2) pathway, the pathway that has been targeted
      in previous clinical trials with limited success. CONCLUSIONS: Drug discovery
      using in silico text mining and pathway analysis tools can facilitate the
      identification of existing drugs that have the potential of topical
      administration to improve OM treatment.

TI  - SREBP2 contributes to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.
PG  - 655-662
LID - 10.1177/1535370218760283 [doi]
AB  - This study is to investigate transcription factors involved in cisplatin
      resistance in ovarian cancer cells. The transcriptome of cisplatin resistant and 
      sensitive A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells was obtained from GSE15372.
      Ovarian transcriptome data GSE62944 was downloaded from TCGA and applied for
      transcription regulatory network analysis. The analysis results were confirmed
      using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The roles of SREBP2 in
      cisplatin-resistant cells were investigated by RNA inference and cell viability
      analysis. Transcription regulatory network analysis found that 12 transcription
      factors and their targets were involved in cisplatin resistant in A2780 cells.
      Among these factors, the targets of EZH2 and SREBP2 revealed by Transcriptional
      Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text mining were also
      enriched in differentially expressed genes between cisplatin resistant and
      cisplatin sensitive cells. Their targets were enriched mainly in cell cycle and
      cholesterol metabolic process, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis illustrated
      three known targets of SREBP2, namely LDLR, FDFT1, and HMGCR were increased in
      A2780-resistant cell lines. Additionally, the three genes and SREBP2 were also
      elevated in live cells after cisplatin treatment via quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction. Importantly, RNA inference of SREBP2 in A2780 cell line resulted 
      in a decrease of cell viability after cisplatin treatment. SREBP2 played
      important roles in cisplatin resistance and cholesterol metabolic process might
      be a novel target for cancer therapy. Impact statement Transcriptome of cisplatin
      resistant and sensitive A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells was obtained from
      GSE15372 and TCGA. Twelve transcription factors and their targets were involved
      in cisplatin resistant. Among these factors, the targets of EZH2 and SREBP2
      revealed by Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based 
      Text mining were also enriched in differentially expressed genes. Their targets
      were enriched mainly in cell cycle and cholesterol metabolic process. Three
      targets of SREBP2, namely LDLR, FDFT1, and HMGCR were increased in
      A2780-resistant cell lines and were found elevated in live cells after cisplatin 
      treatment via qPCR. RNAi of SREBP2 in A2780 cell line resulted in a decrease of
      cell viability after cisplatin treatment. SREBP2 played important roles in
      cisplatin resistance and might be a novel target for cancer therapy.

TI  - The research on gene-disease association based on text-mining of PubMed.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2048-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The associations between genes and diseases are of critical
      significance in aspects of prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Although
      gene-disease relationships have been investigated extensively, much of the
      underpinnings of these associations are yet to be elucidated. METHODS: A novel
      method integrates MeSH database, term weight (TW), and co-occurrence methods to
      predict gene-disease associations based on the cosine similarity between gene
      vectors and disease vectors. Vectors are transformed from the texts of documents 
      in the PubMed database according to the appearance and location of the gene or
      disease terms. The disease related text data has been optimized during the
      process of constructing vectors. RESULTS: The overall distribution of cosine
      similarity value was investigated. By using the gene-disease association data in 
      OMIM database as golden standard, the performance of cosine similarity in
      predicting gene-disease linkage was evaluated. The effects of applying weight
      matrix, penalty weights for keywords (PWK), and normalization were also
      investigated. Finally, we demonstrated that our method outperforms heterogeneous 
      network edge prediction (HNEP) in aspects of precision rate and recall rate.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our method proposed in this paper is easy to be conducted and the
      results can be integrated with other models to improve the overall performance of
      gene-disease association predictions.

AB  - Access to high quality metabolomics data has become a routine component for
      biological studies. However, interpreting those datasets in biological contexts
      remains a challenge, especially because many identified metabolites are not found
      in biochemical pathway databases. Starting from statistical analyses, a range of 
      new tools are available, including metabolite set enrichment analysis, pathway
      and network visualization, pathway prediction, biochemical databases and text
      mining. Integrating these approaches into comprehensive and unbiased
      interpretations must carefully consider both caveats of the metabolomics dataset 
      itself as well as the structure and properties of the biological study design.
      Special considerations need to be taken when adopting approaches from genomics
      for use in metabolomics. R and Python programming language are enabling an easier
      exchange of diverse tools to deploy integrated workflows. This review summarizes 
      the key ideas and latest developments in regards to these approaches.

AB  - Detecting drug-drug interactions (DDI) is important because information on DDIs
      can help prevent adverse effects from drug combinations. Since there are many new
      DDI-related papers published in the biomedical domain, manually extracting DDI
      information from the literature is a laborious task. However, text mining can be 
      used to find DDIs in the biomedical literature. Among the recently developed
      neural networks, we use a Recursive Neural Network to improve the performance of 
      DDI extraction. Our recursive neural network model uses a position feature, a
      subtree containment feature, and an ensemble method to improve the performance of
      DDI extraction. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the DDI detection and 
      type classifiers of our model performed 4.4% and 2.8% better, respectively, on
      the DDIExtraction Challenge'13 test data. We also validated our model on the PK
      DDI corpus that consists of two types of DDIs data: in vivo DDI and in vitro DDI.
      Compared with the existing model, our detection classifier performed 2.3% and
      6.7% better on in vivo and in vitro data respectively. The results of our
      validation demonstrate that our model can automatically extract DDIs better than 
      existing models.

TI  - Deep learning of mutation-gene-drug relations from the literature.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s12859-018-2029-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular biomarkers that can predict drug efficacy in cancer
      patients are crucial components for the advancement of precision medicine.
      However, identifying these molecular biomarkers remains a laborious and
      challenging task. Next-generation sequencing of patients and preclinical models
      have increasingly led to the identification of novel gene-mutation-drug
      relations, and these results have been reported and published in the scientific
      literature. RESULTS: Here, we present two new computational methods that utilize 
      all the PubMed articles as domain specific background knowledge to assist in the 
      extraction and curation of gene-mutation-drug relations from the literature. The 
      first method uses the Biomedical Entity Search Tool (BEST) scoring results as
      some of the features to train the machine learning classifiers. The second method
      uses not only the BEST scoring results, but also word vectors in a deep
      convolutional neural network model that are constructed from and trained on
      numerous documents such as PubMed abstracts and Google News articles. Using the
      features obtained from both the BEST search engine scores and word vectors, we
      extract mutation-gene and mutation-drug relations from the literature using
      machine learning classifiers such as random forest and deep convolutional neural 
      networks. Our methods achieved better results compared with the state-of-the-art 
      methods. We used our proposed features in a simple machine learning model, and
      obtained F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.82 for mutation-gene and mutation-drug relation 
      classification, respectively. We also developed a deep learning classification
      model using convolutional neural networks, BEST scores, and the word embeddings
      that are pre-trained on PubMed or Google News data. Using deep learning, the
      classification accuracy improved, and F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.86 were obtained
      for the mutation-gene and mutation-drug relations, respectively. CONCLUSION: We
      believe that our computational methods described in this research could be used
      as an important tool in identifying molecular biomarkers that predict drug
      responses in cancer patients. We also built a database of these
      mutation-gene-drug relations that were extracted from all the PubMed abstracts.
      We believe that our database can prove to be a valuable resource for precision
      medicine researchers.

PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/s13326-017-0138-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automatic extracting protein entity interaction information from
      biomedical literature can help to build protein relation network and design new
      drugs. There are more than 20 million literature abstracts included in MEDLINE,
      which is the most authoritative textual database in the field of biomedicine, and
      follow an exponential growth over time. This frantic expansion of the biomedical 
      literature can often be difficult to absorb or manually analyze. Thus efficient
      and automated search engines are necessary to efficiently explore the biomedical 
      literature using text mining techniques. RESULTS: The P, R, and F value of tag
      graph method in Aimed corpus are 50.82, 69.76, and 58.61%, respectively. The P,
      R, and F value of tag graph kernel method in other four evaluation corpuses are
      2-5% higher than that of all-paths graph kernel. And The P, R and F value of
      feature kernel and tag graph kernel fuse methods is 53.43, 71.62 and 61.30%,
      respectively. The P, R and F value of feature kernel and tag graph kernel fuse
      methods is 55.47, 70.29 and 60.37%, respectively. It indicated that the
      performance of the two kinds of kernel fusion methods is better than that of
      simple kernel. CONCLUSION: In comparison with the all-paths graph kernel method, 
      the tag graph kernel method is superior in terms of overall performance.
      Experiments show that the performance of the multi-kernels method is better than 
      that of the three separate single-kernel method and the dual-mutually fused
      kernel method used hereof in five corpus sets.

      Gene-Adverse Reactions Associations Using a Text Mining Approach.
PG  - 531-535
AB  - Our objective was to identify and extract gene-drug and drug-adverse drug
      reaction (ADR) relationships from different biomedical literature collections,
      and to predict the possible association between gene and ADR. The drug, ADR and
      gene entities were recognized by a CRF model with multiple features. Logistic
      regression models were constructed for each drug-ADR and drug-gene pair based on 
      its frequency, Mesh Rule association and similarity with known association etc.
      Using predicted score to generate drug-ADR matrix and drug-gene matrix, and then 
      calculating for gene-ADR matrix. Network and clustering analysis were applied to 
      verify and interpret the relationship between them. A total of 78014 potential
      gene-ADR associations were predicted. Part of the predicted results can be
      explained by the network-clustering-pathway analysis, and verified in the
      literature. The gene-drug-ADR network constructed in this study can provide a
      reference for the possible association between the gene and ADR.

LID - 10.1007/s41109-018-0099-7 [doi]
AB  - Creating a map of actors and their leanings is important for policy makers and
      stakeholders in the European Commission's 'Better Regulation Agenda'. We explore 
      publicly available information about the European lobby organizations from the
      Transparency Register, and from the open public consultations in the area of
      Banking and Finance. We consider three complementary types of information about
      lobbying organizations: (i) their formal categorization in the Transparency
      Register, (ii) their responses to the public consultations, and (iii) their
      self-declared goals and activities. We consider responses to the consultations as
      the most relevant indicator of the actual leaning of an individual lobbyist. We
      partition and cluster the organizations according to their demonstrated interests
      and the similarities among their responses. Thus each lobby organization is
      assigned a profile which shows its prevailing interest in consultations' topics, 
      similar organizations in interests and responses, and a prototypical question and
      answer. We combine methods from network analysis, clustering, and text mining to 
      obtain these profiles. Due to the non-homogeneous consultations, we find that it 
      is crucial to first construct a response network based on interests in
      consultations topics, and only then proceed with more detailed analysis of the
      actual answers to consultations. The results provide a first step in the
      understanding of how lobby organizations engage in the policy making process.

TI  - An illustrated approach to Soft Textual Cartography.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1007/s41109-018-0087-y [doi]
AB  - We propose and illustrate an approach of Soft Textual Cartography consisting in
      the clustering of regions by taking into account both their spatial relationships
      and their textual description within a corpus. We reduce large geo-referenced
      textual content into topics and merge them with their spatial configuration to
      reveal spatial patterns. The strategy consists in constructing a complex weighted
      network, reflecting the geographical layout, and whose nodes are further
      characterised by their thematic dissimilarity, extracted form topic modelling. A 
      soft k-means procedure, taking into account both aspects through expectation
      maximisation on Gaussian mixture models and label propagation, converges towards 
      a soft membership, to be further compared with expert knowledge on regions.
      Application on the Wikipedia pages of Swiss municipalities demonstrate the
      potential of the approach, revealing textual autocorrelation and associations
      with official classifications. The synergy of the spatial and textual aspects
      appears promising in topic interpretation and geographical information retrieval,
      and able to incorporate expert knowledge through the choice of the initial
      membership.

TI  - MPLasso: Inferring microbial association networks using prior microbial
      knowledge.
PG  - e1005915
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005915 [doi]
AB  - Due to the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, it becomes
      possible to directly analyze microbial communities in human body and environment.
      To understand how microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact with the
      human body and the surrounding environment, one of the fundamental challenges is 
      to infer the interactions among different microbes. However, due to the
      compositional and high-dimensional nature of microbial data, statistical
      inference cannot offer reliable results. Consequently, new approaches that can
      accurately and robustly estimate the associations (putative interactions) among
      microbes are needed to analyze such compositional and high-dimensional data. We
      propose a novel framework called Microbial Prior Lasso (MPLasso) which integrates
      graph learning algorithm with microbial co-occurrences and associations obtained 
      from scientific literature by using automated text mining. We show that MPLasso
      outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, microbial network recovery
      rate, and reproducibility. Furthermore, the association networks we obtain from
      the Human Microbiome Project datasets show credible results when compared against
      laboratory data.

TI  - Automatic mining of symptom severity from psychiatric evaluation notes.
LID - 10.1002/mpr.1602 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As electronic mental health records become more widely available,
      several approaches have been suggested to automatically extract information from 
      free-text narrative aiming to support epidemiological research and clinical
      decision-making. In this paper, we explore extraction of explicit mentions of
      symptom severity from initial psychiatric evaluation records. We use the data
      provided by the 2016 CEGS N-GRID NLP shared task Track 2, which contains 541
      records manually annotated for symptom severity according to the Research Domain 
      Criteria. METHODS: We designed and implemented 3 automatic methods: a
      knowledge-driven approach relying on local lexicalized rules based on common
      syntactic patterns in text suggesting positive valence symptoms; a machine
      learning method using a neural network; and a hybrid approach combining the first
      2 methods with a neural network. RESULTS: The results on an unseen evaluation set
      of 216 psychiatric evaluation records showed a performance of 80.1% for the
      rule-based method, 73.3% for the machine-learning approach, and 72.0% for the
      hybrid one. CONCLUSIONS: Although more work is needed to improve the accuracy,
      the results are encouraging and indicate that automated text mining methods can
      be used to classify mental health symptom severity from free text psychiatric
      notes to support epidemiological and clinical research.

TI  - Deep Learning based Classification of FDG-PET Data for Alzheimers Disease
      Categories.
LID - 105720J [pii]
LID - 10.1117/12.2294537 [doi]
AB  - Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measures the decline 
      in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, offering a reliable
      metabolic biomarker even on presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. PET
      scans provide functional information that is unique and unavailable using other
      types of imaging. However, the computational efficacy of FDG-PET data alone, for 
      the classification of various Alzheimers Diagnostic categories, has not been well
      studied. This motivates us to correctly discriminate various AD Diagnostic
      categories using FDG-PET data. Deep learning has improved state-of-the-art
      classification accuracies in the areas of speech, signal, image, video, text
      mining and recognition. We propose novel methods that involve probabilistic
      principal component analysis on max-pooled data and mean-pooled data for
      dimensionality reduction, and multilayer feed forward neural network which
      performs binary classification. Our experimental dataset consists of baseline
      data of subjects including 186 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subects, 336 mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with 158 Late MCI and 178 Early MCI, and 146 
      AD patients from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We
      measured F1-measure, precision, recall, negative and positive predictive values
      with a 10-fold cross validation scheme. Our results indicate that our designed
      classifiers achieve competitive results while max pooling achieves better
      classification performance compared to mean-pooled features. Our deep model based
      research may advance FDG-PET analysis by demonstrating their potential as an
      effective imaging biomarker of AD.

PG  - 103100-103107
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.21532 [doi]
AB  - Co-occurrence relationships in PubMed between terms accelerate the recognition of
      term associations. The lack of manually curated relationships in vocabularies and
      the rapid increase of biomedical literatures highlight the importance of
      co-occurrence relationships. Here we proposed a framework to explore term
      associations based on a standard procedure that comprises multiple tools of text 
      mining and relationship degree calculation methods. The text of PubMed were
      segmented into sentences by Apache OpenNLP first, and then terms of sentences
      were recognized by MGREP. After that two terms occurring in a common sentence
      were identified as a co-occurrence relationship. The relationship degree is then 
      calculated using Normalized MEDLINE Distance (NMD) or relationship-scaled score
      (RSS) method. The framework was utilized in exploring associations between terms 
      of Gene Ontology (GO) and Disease Ontology (DO) based on co-occurrence
      relationship. Results show that pairs of terms with more co-occurrence
      relationships indicate shared more semantic relationships of ontology and genes. 
      The identified association terms based on co-occurrence relationships were
      applied in constructing a disease association network (DAN). The small giant
      component confirms with the observation that diseases in the same class have more
      linkage than diseases in different classes.

TI  - Adverse Drug Event Discovery Using Biomedical Literature: A Big Data Neural
      Network Adventure.
PG  - e51
LID - 10.2196/medinform.9170 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of adverse drug events (ADEs) is a tenured topic in medical
      literature. In recent years, increasing numbers of scientific articles and
      health-related social media posts have been generated and shared daily, albeit
      with very limited use for ADE study and with little known about the content with 
      respect to ADEs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a big data
      analytics strategy that mines the content of scientific articles and
      health-related Web-based social media to detect and identify ADEs. METHODS: We
      analyzed the following two data sources: (1) biomedical articles and (2)
      health-related social media blog posts. We developed an intelligent and scalable 
      text mining solution on big data infrastructures composed of Apache Spark,
      natural language processing, and machine learning. This was combined with an
      Elasticsearch No-SQL distributed database to explore and visualize ADEs. RESULTS:
      The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under receiver operating characteristic
      of the system were 92.7%, 93.6%, 93.0%, and 0.905, respectively, and showed
      better results in comparison with traditional approaches in the literature. This 
      work not only detected and classified ADE sentences from big data biomedical
      literature but also scientifically visualized ADE interactions. CONCLUSIONS: To
      the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate a big data
      machine learning strategy for ADE discovery on massive datasets downloaded from
      PubMed Central and social media. This contribution illustrates possible
      capacities in big data biomedical text analysis using advanced computational
      methods with real-time update from new data published on a daily basis.

TI  - Annotating gene sets by mining large literature collections with protein
      networks.
PG  - 602-613
AB  - Analysis of patient genomes and transcriptomes routinely recognizes new gene sets
      associated with human disease. Here we present an integrative natural language
      processing system which infers common functions for a gene set through automatic 
      mining of the scientific literature with biological networks. This system links
      genes with associated literature phrases and combines these links with protein
      interactions in a single heterogeneous network. Multiscale functional annotations
      are inferred based on network distances between phrases and genes and then
      visualized as an ontology of biological concepts. To evaluate this system, we
      predict functions for gene sets representing known pathways and find that our
      approach achieves substantial improvement over the conventional text-mining
      baseline method. Moreover, our system discovers novel annotations for gene sets
      or pathways without previously known functions. Two case studies demonstrate how 
      the system is used in discovery of new cancer-related pathways with ontological
      annotations.

AB  - The study was main to explore the clinical characters of Shugan Jieyu capsule
      through text mining. The data sets of Shugan Jieyu capsule were downloaded from
      CMCC database by the method of literature retrieved from May 2009 to Jan 2016.
      Rules of Chinese medical patterns, diseases, symptoms and combination treatment
      were mined out by data slicing algorithm, and they were demonstrated in frequency
      tables and two dimension based network. Then totally 190 literature were
      recruited. The outcomess suggested that SC was most frequently correlated with
      liver Qi stagnation. Primary depression, depression due to brain disease,
      concomitant depression followed by physical diseases, concomitant depression
      followed by schizophrenia and functional dyspepsia were main diseases treated by 
      Shugan Jieyu capsule. Symptoms like low mood, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety
      and dysfunction of automatic nerve were mainy relieved bv Shugan Jieyu
      capsule.For combination treatment. Shugan Jieyu capsule was most commonly used
      with paroxetine, sertraline and fluoxetine. The research suggested that syndrome 
      types and mining results of Shugan Jieyu capsule were almost the same as its
      instructions. Syndrome of malnutrition of heart spirit was the potential Chinese 
      medical pattern of Shugan Jieyu capsule. Primary comorbid anxiety and depression,
      concomitant comorbid anxiety and depression followed by physical diseases, and
      postpartum depression were potential diseases treated by Shugan Jieyu capsule.For
      combination treatment, Shugan Jieyu capsule was most commonly used with
      paroxetine, sertraline and fluoxetine.

TI  - iPTMnet: an integrated resource for protein post-translational modification
      network discovery.
PG  - D542-D550
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkx1104 [doi]
AB  - Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a pivotal role in numerous
      biological processes by modulating regulation of protein function. We have
      developed iPTMnet (http://proteininformationresource.org/iPTMnet) for PTM
      knowledge discovery, employing an integrative bioinformatics approach-combining
      text mining, data mining, and ontological representation to capture rich PTM
      information, including PTM enzyme-substrate-site relationships, PTM-specific
      protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and PTM conservation across species. iPTMnet 
      encompasses data from (i) our PTM-focused text mining tools, RLIMS-P and eFIP,
      which extract phosphorylation information from full-scale mining of PubMed
      abstracts and full-length articles; (ii) a set of curated databases with
      experimentally observed PTMs; and iii) Protein Ontology that organizes proteins
      and PTM proteoforms, enabling their representation, annotation and comparison
      within and across species. Presently covering eight major PTM types
      (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, glycosylation,
      S-nitrosylation, sumoylation and myristoylation), iPTMnet knowledgebase contains 
      more than 654 500 unique PTM sites in over 62 100 proteins, along with more than 
      1200 PTM enzymes and over 24 300 PTM enzyme-substrate-site relations. The website
      supports online search, browsing, retrieval and visual analysis for scientific
      queries. Several examples, including functional interpretation of
      phosphoproteomic data, demonstrate iPTMnet as a gateway for visual exploration
      and systematic analysis of PTM networks and conservation, thereby enabling PTM
      discovery and hypothesis generation.

TI  - Entity recognition in the biomedical domain using a hybrid approach.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/s13326-017-0157-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This article describes a high-recall, high-precision approach for the
      extraction of biomedical entities from scientific articles. METHOD: The approach 
      uses a two-stage pipeline, combining a dictionary-based entity recognizer with a 
      machine-learning classifier. First, the OGER entity recognizer, which has a bias 
      towards high recall, annotates the terms that appear in selected domain
      ontologies. Subsequently, the Distiller framework uses this information as a
      feature for a machine learning algorithm to select the relevant entities only.
      For this step, we compare two different supervised machine-learning algorithms:
      Conditional Random Fields and Neural Networks. RESULTS: In an in-domain
      evaluation using the CRAFT corpus, we test the performance of the combined
      systems when recognizing chemicals, cell types, cellular components, biological
      processes, molecular functions, organisms, proteins, and biological sequences.
      Our best system combines dictionary-based candidate generation with
      Neural-Network-based filtering. It achieves an overall precision of 86% at a
      recall of 60% on the named entity recognition task, and a precision of 51% at a
      recall of 49% on the concept recognition task. CONCLUSION: These results are to
      our knowledge the best reported so far in this particular task.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Learning Semantics via External Resources for Classifying
      Diagnosis Codes in Discharge Notes.
PG  - e380
LID - 10.2196/jmir.8344 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated disease code classification using free-text medical
      information is important for public health surveillance. However, traditional
      natural language processing (NLP) pipelines are limited, so we propose a method
      combining word embedding with a convolutional neural network (CNN). OBJECTIVE:
      Our objective was to compare the performance of traditional pipelines (NLP plus
      supervised machine learning models) with that of word embedding combined with a
      CNN in conducting a classification task identifying International Classification 
      of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes in
      discharge notes. METHODS: We used 2 classification methods: (1) extracting from
      discharge notes some features (terms, n-gram phrases, and SNOMED CT categories)
      that we used to train a set of supervised machine learning models (support vector
      machine, random forests, and gradient boosting machine), and (2) building a
      feature matrix, by a pretrained word embedding model, that we used to train a
      CNN. We used these methods to identify the chapter-level ICD-10-CM diagnosis
      codes in a set of discharge notes. We conducted the evaluation using 103,390
      discharge notes covering patients hospitalized from June 1, 2015 to January 31,
      2017 in the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. We used the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve as an evaluation measure, and calculated the area 
      under the curve (AUC) and F-measure as the global measure of effectiveness.
      RESULTS: In 5-fold cross-validation tests, our method had a higher testing
      accuracy (mean AUC 0.9696; mean F-measure 0.9086) than traditional NLP-based
      approaches (mean AUC range 0.8183-0.9571; mean F-measure range 0.5050-0.8739). A 
      real-world simulation that split the training sample and the testing sample by
      date verified this result (mean AUC 0.9645; mean F-measure 0.9003 using the
      proposed method). Further analysis showed that the convolutional layers of the
      CNN effectively identified a large number of keywords and automatically extracted
      enough concepts to predict the diagnosis codes. CONCLUSIONS: Word embedding
      combined with a CNN showed outstanding performance compared with traditional
      methods, needing very little data preprocessing. This shows that future studies
      will not be limited by incomplete dictionaries. A large amount of unstructured
      information from free-text medical writing will be extracted by automated
      approaches in the future, and we believe that the health care field is about to
      enter the age of big data.

TI  - Stopping Antidepressants and Anxiolytics as Major Concerns Reported in Online
      Health Communities: A Text Mining Approach.
PG  - e48
LID - 10.2196/mental.7797 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internet is a particularly dynamic way to quickly capture the
      perceptions of a population in real time. Complementary to traditional
      face-to-face communication, online social networks help patients to improve
      self-esteem and self-help. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use text
      mining on material from an online forum exploring patients' concerns about
      treatment (antidepressants and anxiolytics). METHODS: Concerns about treatment
      were collected from discussion titles in patients' online community related to
      antidepressants and anxiolytics. To examine the content of these titles
      automatically, we used text mining methods, such as word frequency in a
      document-term matrix and co-occurrence of words using a network analysis. It was 
      thus possible to identify topics discussed on the forum. RESULTS: The forum
      included 2415 discussions on antidepressants and anxiolytics over a period of 3
      years. After a preprocessing step, the text mining algorithm identified the 99
      most frequently occurring words in titles, among which were escitalopram,
      withdrawal, antidepressant, venlafaxine, paroxetine, and effect. Patients'
      concerns were related to antidepressant withdrawal, the need to share experience 
      about symptoms, effects, and questions on weight gain with some drugs.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients' expression on the Internet is a potential additional
      resource in addressing patients' concerns about treatment. Patient profiles are
      close to that of patients treated in psychiatry.

TI  - A method for named entity normalization in biomedical articles: application to
      diseases and plants.
PG  - 451
LID - 10.1186/s12859-017-1857-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In biomedical articles, a named entity recognition (NER) technique
      that identifies entity names from texts is an important element for extracting
      biological knowledge from articles. After NER is applied to articles, the next
      step is to normalize the identified names into standard concepts (i.e., disease
      names are mapped to the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings
      disease terms). In biomedical articles, many entity normalization methods rely on
      domain-specific dictionaries for resolving synonyms and abbreviations. However,
      the dictionaries are not comprehensive except for some entities such as genes. In
      recent years, biomedical articles have accumulated rapidly, and neural
      network-based algorithms that incorporate a large amount of unlabeled data have
      shown considerable success in several natural language processing problems.
      RESULTS: In this study, we propose an approach for normalizing biological
      entities, such as disease names and plant names, by using word embeddings to
      represent semantic spaces. For diseases, training data from the National Center
      for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) disease corpus and unlabeled data from
      PubMed abstracts were used to construct word representations. For plants, a
      training corpus that we manually constructed and unlabeled PubMed abstracts were 
      used to represent word vectors. We showed that the proposed approach performed
      better than the use of only the training corpus or only the unlabeled data and
      showed that the normalization accuracy was improved by using our model even when 
      the dictionaries were not comprehensive. We obtained F-scores of 0.808 and 0.690 
      for normalizing the NCBI disease corpus and manually constructed plant corpus,
      respectively. We further evaluated our approach using a data set in the disease
      normalization task of the BioCreative V challenge. When only the disease corpus
      was used as a dictionary, our approach significantly outperformed the best system
      of the task. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach shows robust performance for
      normalizing biological entities. The manually constructed plant corpus and the
      proposed model are available at http://gcancer.org/plant and
      http://gcancer.org/normalization , respectively.

AB  - Background: Dyslipidemia is one of the major forms of lipid disorder,
      characterized by increased triglycerides (TGs), increased low-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in blood. Recently, MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
      have been reported to involve in various biological processes; their potential
      usage being a biomarkers and in diagnosis of various diseases. Computational
      approaches including text mining have been used recently to analyze abstracts
      from the public databases to observe the relationships/associations between the
      biological molecules, miRNAs, and disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: In
      the present study, significance of text mined extracted pair associations
      (miRNA-lipid disease) were estimated by one-sided Fisher's exact test. The top 20
      significant miRNA-disease associations were visualized on Cytoscape. The
      CyTargetLinker plug-in tool on Cytoscape was used to extend the network and
      predicts new miRNA target genes. The Biological Networks Gene Ontology (BiNGO)
      plug-in tool on Cytoscape was used to retrieve gene ontology (GO) annotations for
      the targeted genes. Results: We retrieved 227 miRNA-lipid disease associations
      including 148 miRNAs. The top 20 significant miRNAs analysis on CyTargetLinker
      provides defined, predicted and validated gene targets, further targeted genes
      analyzed by BiNGO showed targeted genes were significantly associated with lipid,
      cholesterol, apolipoprotein, and fatty acids GO terms. Conclusion: We are the
      first to provide a reliable miRNA-lipid disease association network based on text
      mining. This could help future experimental studies that aim to validate
      predicted gene targets.

TI  - An attention-based effective neural model for drug-drug interactions extraction.
PG  - 445
LID - 10.1186/s12859-017-1855-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) often bring unexpected side effects.
      The clinical recognition of DDIs is a crucial issue for both patient safety and
      healthcare cost control. However, although text-mining-based systems explore
      various methods to classify DDIs, the classification performance with regard to
      DDIs in long and complex sentences is still unsatisfactory. METHODS: In this
      study, we propose an effective model that classifies DDIs from the literature by 
      combining an attention mechanism and a recurrent neural network with long
      short-term memory (LSTM) units. In our approach, first, a candidate-drug-oriented
      input attention acting on word-embedding vectors automatically learns which words
      are more influential for a given drug pair. Next, the inputs merging the
      position- and POS-embedding vectors are passed to a bidirectional LSTM layer
      whose outputs at the last time step represent the high-level semantic information
      of the whole sentence. Finally, a softmax layer performs DDI classification.
      RESULTS: Experimental results from the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus show that our
      system performs the best with respect to detection and classification (84.0% and 
      77.3%, respectively) compared with other state-of-the-art methods. In particular,
      for the Medline-2013 dataset with long and complex sentences, our F-score far
      exceeds those of top-ranking systems by 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach
      effectively improves the performance of DDI classification tasks. Experimental
      analysis demonstrates that our model performs better with respect to recognizing 
      not only close-range but also long-range patterns among words, especially for
      long, complex and compound sentences.

TI  - DRREP: deep ridge regressed epitope predictor.
PG  - 676
LID - 10.1186/s12864-017-4024-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ability to predict epitopes plays an enormous role in vaccine
      development in terms of our ability to zero in on where to do a more thorough
      in-vivo analysis of the protein in question. Though for the past decade there
      have been numerous advancements and improvements in epitope prediction, on
      average the best benchmark prediction accuracies are still only around 60%. New
      machine learning algorithms have arisen within the domain of deep learning, text 
      mining, and convolutional networks. This paper presents a novel analytically
      trained and string kernel using deep neural network, which is tailored for
      continuous epitope prediction, called: Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor
      (DRREP). RESULTS: DRREP was tested on long protein sequences from the following
      datasets: SARS, Pellequer, HIV, AntiJen, and SEQ194. DRREP was compared to
      numerous state of the art epitope predictors, including the most recently
      published predictors called LBtope and DMNLBE. Using area under ROC curve (AUC), 
      DRREP achieved a performance improvement over the best performing predictors on
      SARS (13.7%), HIV (8.9%), Pellequer (1.5%), and SEQ194 (3.1%), with its
      performance being matched only on the AntiJen dataset, by the LBtope predictor,
      where both DRREP and LBtope achieved an AUC of 0.702. CONCLUSION: DRREP is an
      analytically trained deep neural network, thus capable of learning in a single
      step through regression. By combining the features of deep learning, string
      kernels, and convolutional networks, the system is able to perform
      residue-by-residue prediction of continues epitopes with higher accuracy than the
      current state of the art predictors.

TI  - PIBAS FedSPARQL: a web-based platform for integration and exploration of
      bioinformatics datasets.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s13326-017-0151-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are a huge variety of data sources relevant to chemical,
      biological and pharmacological research, but these data sources are highly siloed
      and cannot be queried together in a straightforward way. Semantic technologies
      offer the ability to create links and mappings across datasets and manage them as
      a single, linked network so that searching can be carried out across datasets,
      independently of the source. We have developed an application called PIBAS
      FedSPARQL that uses semantic technologies to allow researchers to carry out such 
      searching across a vast array of data sources. RESULTS: PIBAS FedSPARQL is a
      web-based query builder and result set visualizer of bioinformatics data. As an
      advanced feature, our system can detect similar data items identified by
      different Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), using a text-mining algorithm
      based on the processing of named entities to be used in Vector Space Model and
      Cosine Similarity Measures. According to our knowledge, PIBAS FedSPARQL was
      unique among the systems that we found in that it allows detecting of similar
      data items. As a query builder, our system allows researchers to intuitively
      construct and run Federated SPARQL queries across multiple data sources,
      including global initiatives, such as Bio2RDF, Chem2Bio2RDF, EMBL-EBI, and one
      local initiative called CPCTAS, as well as additional user-specified data source.
      From the input topic, subtopic, template and keyword, a corresponding initial
      Federated SPARQL query is created and executed. Based on the data obtained, end
      users have the ability to choose the most appropriate data sources in their area 
      of interest and exploit their Resource Description Framework (RDF) structure,
      which allows users to select certain properties of data to enhance query results.
      CONCLUSIONS: The developed system is flexible and allows intuitive creation and
      execution of queries for an extensive range of bioinformatics topics. Also, the
      novel "similar data items detection" algorithm can be particularly useful for
      suggesting new data sources and cost optimization for new experiments. PIBAS
      FedSPARQL can be expanded with new topics, subtopics and templates on demand,
      rendering information retrieval more robust.

AB  - To explore the pharmacological principle of Artemisia carvifolia,the text mining 
      technique was used. All the references of A. carvifolia were collected from
      PubMed database, and then the rules of the main ingredient,relative diseases,
      organs, tissues, proteins and metabolites were analyzed. Finally, a network was
      set up. Then it was found that the main ingredients included
      sesquiterpenoids,flavonoids,and volatileoils.The diseases such as malaria,
      cerebral malaria, falciparum malaria, visceral leishmaniasis and systemic lupus
      erythematosus were often treated with A. carvifolia. In association in organ were
      the liver, skin, trachea,lungs,and spleen.Correlations with tissues were mainly
      including macrophages, T lymphocytes, blood vessels, epithelial cells.The protein
      was correlation with it involved CYP450, PI3K, TNF-alpha, AASDPPT, DNA polymerase
      and so on. Comprehensive and systematic treatment principle of A. carvifolia was 
      obtained by text mining, which was helpful in clinical application.

TI  - Large-scale cross-species chemogenomic platform proposes a new drug discovery
      strategy of veterinary drug from herbal medicines.
PG  - e0184880
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0184880 [doi]
AB  - Veterinary Herbal Medicine (VHM) is a comprehensive, current, and informative
      discipline on the utilization of herbs in veterinary practice. Driven by
      chemistry but progressively directed by pharmacology and the clinical sciences,
      drug research has contributed more to address the needs for innovative veterinary
      medicine for curing animal diseases. However, research into veterinary medicine
      of vegetal origin in the pharmaceutical industry has reduced, owing to questions 
      such as the short of compatibility of traditional natural-product extract
      libraries with high-throughput screening. Here, we present a cross-species
      chemogenomic screening platform to dissect the genetic basis of multifactorial
      diseases and to determine the most suitable points of attack for future
      veterinary medicines, thereby increasing the number of treatment options. First, 
      based on critically examined pharmacology and text mining, we build a
      cross-species drug-likeness evaluation approach to screen the lead compounds in
      veterinary medicines. Second, a specific cross-species target prediction model is
      developed to infer drug-target connections, with the purpose of understanding how
      drugs work on the specific targets. Third, we focus on exploring the multiple
      targets interference effects of veterinary medicines by heterogeneous network
      convergence and modularization analysis. Finally, we manually integrate a disease
      pathway to test whether the cross-species chemogenomic platform could uncover the
      active mechanism of veterinary medicine, which is exemplified by a specific
      network module. We believe the proposed cross-species chemogenomic platform
      allows for the systematization of current and traditional knowledge of veterinary
      medicine and, importantly, for the application of this emerging body of knowledge
      to the development of new drugs for animal diseases.

TI  - Deep learning with word embeddings improves biomedical named entity recognition.
PG  - i37-i48
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx228 [doi]
AB  - Motivation: Text mining has become an important tool for biomedical research. The
      most fundamental text-mining task is the recognition of biomedical named entities
      (NER), such as genes, chemicals and diseases. Current NER methods rely on
      pre-defined features which try to capture the specific surface properties of
      entity types, properties of the typical local context, background knowledge, and 
      linguistic information. State-of-the-art tools are entity-specific, as
      dictionaries and empirically optimal feature sets differ between entity types,
      which makes their development costly. Furthermore, features are often optimized
      for a specific gold standard corpus, which makes extrapolation of quality
      measures difficult. Results: We show that a completely generic method based on
      deep learning and statistical word embeddings [called long short-term memory
      network-conditional random field (LSTM-CRF)] outperforms state-of-the-art
      entity-specific NER tools, and often by a large margin. To this end, we compared 
      the performance of LSTM-CRF on 33 data sets covering five different entity
      classes with that of best-of-class NER tools and an entity-agnostic CRF
      implementation. On average, F1-score of LSTM-CRF is 5% above that of the
      baselines, mostly due to a sharp increase in recall. Availability and
      implementation: The source code for LSTM-CRF is available at
      https://github.com/glample/tagger and the links to the corpora are available at
      https://corposaurus.github.io/corpora/ . Contact:

TI  - Exploring sets of molecules from patents and relationships to other active
      compounds in chemical space networks.
PG  - 779-788
LID - 10.1007/s10822-017-0061-2 [doi]
AB  - Patents from medicinal chemistry represent a rich source of novel compounds and
      activity data that appear only infrequently in the scientific literature.
      Moreover, patent information provides a primary focal point for drug discovery.
      Accordingly, text mining and image extraction approaches have become hot topics
      in patent analysis and repositories of patent data are being established. In this
      work, we have generated network representations using alternative similarity
      measures to systematically compare molecules from patents with other bioactive
      compounds, visualize similarity relationships, explore the chemical neighbourhood
      of patent molecules, and identify closely related compounds with different
      activities. The design of network representations that combine patent molecules
      and other bioactive compounds and view patent information in the context of
      current bioactive chemical space aids in the analysis of patents and further
      extends the use of molecular networks to explore structure-activity
      relationships.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients communicate with healthcare providers via secure messaging in
      patient portals. As patient portal adoption increases, growing messaging volumes 
      may overwhelm providers. Prior research has demonstrated promise in automating
      classification of patient portal messages into communication types to support
      message triage or answering. This paper examines if using semantic features and
      word context improves portal message classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Portal messages were classified into the following categories: informational,
      medical, social, and logistical. We constructed features from portal messages
      including bag of words, bag of phrases, graph representations, and word
      embeddings. We trained one-versus-all random forest and logistic regression
      classifiers, and convolutional neural network (CNN) with a softmax output. We
      evaluated each classifier's performance using Area Under the Curve (AUC).
      RESULTS: Representing the messages using bag of words, the random forest detected
      informational, medical, social, and logistical communications in patient portal
      messages with AUCs: 0.803, 0.884, 0.828, and 0.928, respectively. Graph
      representations of messages outperformed simpler features with AUCs: 0.837,
      0.914, 0.846, 0.884 for informational, medical, social, and logistical
      communication, respectively. Representing words with Word2Vec embeddings, and
      mapping features using a CNN had the best performance with AUCs: 0.908 for
      informational, 0.917 for medical, 0.935 for social, and 0.943 for logistical
      categories. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Word2Vec and graph representations
      improved the accuracy of classifying portal messages compared to features that
      lacked semantic information such as bag of words, and bag of phrases.
      Furthermore, using Word2Vec along with a CNN model, which provide a higher order 
      representation, improved the classification of portal messages.

      networks of text-based coded information.
PG  - 66-75
AB  - Literature review is critical but time-consuming in the post-market surveillance 
      of medical products. We focused on the safety signal of intussusception after the
      vaccination of infants with the Rotashield Vaccine in 1999 and retrieved all
      PubMed abstracts for rotavirus vaccines published after January 1, 1998. We used 
      the Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records system, the MetaMap
      tool, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies Annotator to process the 
      abstracts and generate coded terms stamped with the date of publication. Data
      were analyzed in the Pattern-based and Advanced Network Analyzer for Clinical
      Evaluation and Assessment to evaluate the intussusception-related findings before
      and after the release of the new rotavirus vaccines in 2006. The tight connection
      of intussusception with the historical signal in the first period and the absence
      of any safety concern for the new vaccines in the second period were verified. We
      demonstrated the feasibility for semi-automated solutions that may assist medical
      reviewers in monitoring biomedical literature.

TI  - A neural network multi-task learning approach to biomedical named entity
      recognition.
PG  - 368
LID - 10.1186/s12859-017-1776-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in biomedical text
      mining. Accurate NER systems require task-specific, manually-annotated datasets, 
      which are expensive to develop and thus limited in size. Since such datasets
      contain related but different information, an interesting question is whether it 
      might be possible to use them together to improve NER performance. To investigate
      this, we develop supervised, multi-task, convolutional neural network models and 
      apply them to a large number of varied existing biomedical named entity datasets.
      Additionally, we investigated the effect of dataset size on performance in both
      single- and multi-task settings. RESULTS: We present a single-task model for NER,
      a Multi-output multi-task model and a Dependent multi-task model. We apply the
      three models to 15 biomedical datasets containing multiple named entities
      including Anatomy, Chemical, Disease, Gene/Protein and Species. Each dataset
      represent a task. The results from the single-task model and the multi-task
      models are then compared for evidence of benefits from Multi-task Learning. With 
      the Multi-output multi-task model we observed an average F-score improvement of
      0.8% when compared to the single-task model from an average baseline of 78.4%.
      Although there was a significant drop in performance on one dataset, performance 
      improves significantly for five datasets by up to 6.3%. For the Dependent
      multi-task model we observed an average improvement of 0.4% when compared to the 
      single-task model. There were no significant drops in performance on any dataset,
      and performance improves significantly for six datasets by up to 1.1%. The
      dataset size experiments found that as dataset size decreased, the multi-output
      model's performance increased compared to the single-task model's. Using 50, 25
      and 10% of the training data resulted in an average drop of approximately 3.4, 8 
      and 16.7% respectively for the single-task model but approximately 0.2, 3.0 and
      9.8% for the multi-task model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that, on average,
      the multi-task models produced better NER results than the single-task models
      trained on a single NER dataset. We also found that Multi-task Learning is
      beneficial for small datasets. Across the various settings the improvements are
      significant, demonstrating the benefit of Multi-task Learning for this task.

TI  - Scalable Text Mining Assisted Curation of Post-Translationally Modified
      Proteoforms in the Protein Ontology.
LID - http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1747/BIT103_ICBO2016.pdf [pii]
AB  - The Protein Ontology (PRO) defines protein classes and their interrelationships
      from the family to the protein form (proteoform) level within and across species.
      One of the unique contributions of PRO is its representation of
      post-translationally modified (PTM) proteoforms. However, progress in adding PTM 
      proteoform classes to PRO has been relatively slow due to the extensive manual
      curation effort required. Here we report an automated pipeline for creation of
      PTM proteoform classes that leverages two phosphorylation-focused text mining
      tools (RLIMS-P, which detects mentions of kinases, substrates, and
      phosphorylation sites, and eFIP, which detects phosphorylation-dependent
      protein-protein interactions (PPIs)) and our integrated PTM database, iPTMnet. By
      applying this pipeline, we obtained a set of ~820 substrate-site pairs that are
      suitable for automated PRO term generation with literature-based evidence
      attribution. Inclusion of these terms in PRO will increase PRO coverage of
      species-specific PTM proteoforms by 50%. Many of these new proteoforms also have 
      associated kinase and/or PPI information. Finally, we show a phosphorylation
      network for the human and mouse peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PIN1/Pin1)
      derived from our dataset that demonstrates the biological complexity of the
      information we have extracted. Our approach addresses scalability in PRO curation
      and will be further expanded to advance PRO representation of phosphorylated
      proteoforms.

TI  - Comorbidities in the diseasome are more apparent than real: What Bayesian
      filtering reveals about the comorbidities of depression.
PG  - e1005487
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005487 [doi]
AB  - Comorbidity patterns have become a major source of information to explore shared 
      mechanisms of pathogenesis between disorders. In hypothesis-free exploration of
      comorbid conditions, disease-disease networks are usually identified by pairwise 
      methods. However, interpretation of the results is hindered by several
      confounders. In particular a very large number of pairwise associations can arise
      indirectly through other comorbidity associations and they increase exponentially
      with the increasing breadth of the investigated diseases. To investigate and
      filter this effect, we computed and compared pairwise approaches with a
      systems-based method, which constructs a sparse Bayesian direct multimorbidity
      map (BDMM) by systematically eliminating disease-mediated comorbidity relations. 
      Additionally, focusing on depression-related parts of the BDMM, we evaluated
      correspondence with results from logistic regression, text-mining and
      molecular-level measures for comorbidities such as genetic overlap and the
      interactome-based association score. We used a subset of the UK Biobank Resource,
      a cross-sectional dataset including 247 diseases and 117,392 participants who
      filled out a detailed questionnaire about mental health. The sparse comorbidity
      map confirmed that depressed patients frequently suffer from both psychiatric and
      somatic comorbid disorders. Notably, anxiety and obesity show strong and direct
      relationships with depression. The BDMM identified further directly co-morbid
      somatic disorders, e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or migraine.
      Using the subnetwork of depression and metabolic disorders for functional
      analysis, the interactome-based system-level score showed the best agreement with
      the sparse disease network. This indicates that these epidemiologically strong
      disease-disease relations have improved correspondence with expected
      molecular-level mechanisms. The substantially fewer number of comorbidity
      relations in the BDMM compared to pairwise methods implies that biologically
      meaningful comorbid relations may be less frequent than earlier pairwise methods 
      suggested. The computed interactive comprehensive multimorbidity views over the
      diseasome are available on the web at Co=MorNet:
      bioinformatics.mit.bme.hu/UKBNetworks.

TI  - Beyond epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition: Common suppression of
      differentiation programs underlies epithelial barrier dysfunction in mild,
      moderate, and severe asthma.
PG  - 1988-2004
LID - 10.1111/all.13222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epithelial barrier dysfunction is a central feature in the
      pathogenesis of allergic disease. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has 
      been proposed as one mechanism afflicting barrier in asthma. However, genes and
      pathways involved in aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal signaling, and their
      relationship to asthma severity, are poorly understood. METHODS: We used unbiased
      gene network analysis to evaluate functional convergence in epithelial gene
      expression signatures across multiple public access transcriptomics datasets of
      human asthma, followed by text mining to evaluate functional marker relevance of 
      discovered genes. We objectively confirmed these findings in epithelial brushings
      and primary asthmatic epithelial cells cultured in different biological contexts.
      RESULTS: We found a striking suppression of epithelial differentiation in asthma,
      overrepresented by insufficiency in insulin and Notch signaling, but with the
      absence of conventional EMT markers. We identified EFNB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, INSR,
      IRS2, NOTCH2, TLE1, and NTRK2 as novel markers central to dysregulation of
      epithelial-mesenchymal signaling, but surprisingly overlooked in asthma research.
      We found that this "core" signature of asthma is shared by mild, moderate, and
      severe forms of disease, progressing with severity. Loss of epithelial
      differentiation induced by insulin deprivation in normal human bronchial
      epithelial cells cultured in organotypic conditions closely approximated gene
      expression in asthmatic epithelial brushings. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative
      analysis of publically available transcriptomes demonstrated that epithelial
      barrier dysfunction in asthma is characterized by persistent underlying
      de-differentiation program with complex etiology. The lasting alteration of the
      asthmatic epithelial cell transcriptome implicates regulation involving
      metabolism and epigenetics, beyond EMT driven by injury and repair in chronic
      inflammation.

AB  - In this paper, we have identified and analyzed the emergence, structure and
      dynamics of the paradigmatic research fronts that established the fundamentals of
      the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A search of papers with the identifiers
      "HIV/AIDS", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "HIV-1" and "Acquired
      Immunodeficiency Syndrome" in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), was carried
      out. A citation network of those papers was constructed. Then, a sub-network of
      the papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree
      of 28) was selected to perform a combination of network clustering and text
      mining to identify the paradigmatic research fronts and analyze their dynamics.
      Thirteen research fronts were identified in this sub-network. The biggest and
      oldest front is related to the clinical knowledge on the disease in the patient. 
      Nine of the fronts are related to the study of specific molecular structures and 
      mechanisms and two of these fronts are related to the development of drugs. The
      rest of the fronts are related to the study of the disease at the cellular level.
      Interestingly, the emergence of these fronts occurred in successive "waves" over 
      the time which suggest a transition in the paradigmatic focus. The emergence and 
      evolution of the biomedical fronts in HIV/AIDS research is explained not just by 
      the partition of the problem in elements and interactions leading to increasingly
      specialized communities, but also by changes in the technological context of this
      health problem and the dramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of
      HIV/AIDS that occurred between 1993 and 1995.

TI  - Disease causality extraction based on lexical semantics and document-clause
      frequency from biomedical literature.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s12911-017-0448-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, research on human disease network has succeeded and has
      become an aid in figuring out the relationship between various diseases. In most 
      disease networks, however, the relationship between diseases has been simply
      represented as an association. This representation results in the difficulty of
      identifying prior diseases and their influence on posterior diseases. In this
      paper, we propose a causal disease network that implements disease causality
      through text mining on biomedical literature. METHODS: To identify the causality 
      between diseases, the proposed method includes two schemes: the first is the
      lexicon-based causality term strength, which provides the causal strength on a
      variety of causality terms based on lexicon analysis. The second is the
      frequency-based causality strength, which determines the direction and strength
      of causality based on document and clause frequencies in the literature. RESULTS:
      We applied the proposed method to 6,617,833 PubMed literature, and chose 195
      diseases to construct a causal disease network. From all possible pairs of
      disease nodes in the network, 1011 causal pairs of 149 diseases were extracted.
      The resulting network was compared with that of a previous study. In terms of
      both coverage and quality, the proposed method showed outperforming results; it
      determined 2.7 times more causalities and showed higher correlation with
      associated diseases than the existing method. CONCLUSIONS: This research has
      novelty in which the proposed method circumvents the limitations of time and cost
      in applying all possible causalities in biological experiments and it is a more
      advanced text mining technique by defining the concepts of causality term
      strength.

      Visualization of Keywords and Topics.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.4258/hir.2017.23.2.77 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to review and visualize the medical
      informatics field over the previous 12 months according to the frequencies of
      keywords and topics in papers published in the top four journals in the field and
      in Healthcare Informatics Research (HIR), an official journal of the Korean
      Society of Medical Informatics. METHODS: A six-person team conducted an extensive
      review of the literature on clinical and consumer informatics. The literature was
      searched using keywords employed in the American Medical Informatics Association 
      year-in-review process and organized into 14 topics used in that process. Data
      were analyzed using word clouds, social network analysis, and association rules. 
      RESULTS: The literature search yielded 370 references and 1,123 unique keywords. 
      'Electronic Health Record' (EHR) (78.6%) was the most frequently appearing
      keyword in the articles published in the five studied journals, followed by
      'telemedicine' (2.1%). EHR (37.6%) was also the most frequently studied topic
      area, followed by clinical informatics (12.0%). However, 'telemedicine' (17.0%)
      was the most frequently appearing keyword in articles published in HIR, followed 
      by 'telecommunications' (4.5%). Telemedicine (47.1%) was the most frequently
      studied topic area, followed by EHR (14.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings
      reflect the Korean government's efforts to introduce telemedicine into the Korean
      healthcare system and reactions to this from the stakeholders associated with
      telemedicine.

PG  - 237
LID - 10.1186/s12859-017-1664-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major challenge of high throughput transcriptome studies is
      presenting the data to researchers in an interpretable format. In many cases, the
      outputs of such studies are gene lists which are then examined for enriched
      biological concepts. One approach to help the researcher interpret large gene
      datasets is to associate genes and informative terms (iTerm) that are obtained
      from the biomedical literature using the eGIFT text-mining system. However,
      examining large lists of iTerm and gene pairs is a daunting task. RESULTS: We
      have developed WebGIVI, an interactive web-based visualization tool (
      http://raven.anr.udel.edu/webgivi/ ) to explore gene:iTerm pairs. WebGIVI was
      built via Cytoscape and Data Driven Document JavaScript libraries and can be used
      to relate genes to iTerms and then visualize gene and iTerm pairs. WebGIVI can
      accept a gene list that is used to retrieve the gene symbols and corresponding
      iTerm list. This list can be submitted to visualize the gene iTerm pairs using
      two distinct methods: a Concept Map or a Cytoscape Network Map. In addition,
      WebGIVI also supports uploading and visualization of any two-column tab separated
      data. CONCLUSIONS: WebGIVI provides an interactive and integrated network graph
      of gene and iTerms that allows filtering, sorting, and grouping, which can aid
      biologists in developing hypothesis based on the input gene lists. In addition,
      WebGIVI can visualize hundreds of nodes and generate a high-resolution image that
      is important for most of research publications. The source code can be freely
      downloaded at https://github.com/sunliang3361/WebGIVI . The WebGIVI tutorial is

LID - 10.4338/ACI-2016-10-RA-0169 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of automated dose and adverse event
      information retrieval in supporting the identification of safety patterns.
      METHODS: We extracted all rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (rATG) reports submitted
      to the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System 
      (FAERS) from the product's initial licensure in April 16, 1984 through February
      8, 2016. We processed the narratives using the Medication Extraction (MedEx) and 
      the Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records (ETHER) systems and
      retrieved the appropriate medication, clinical, and temporal information. When
      necessary, the extracted information was manually curated. This process resulted 
      in a high quality dataset that was analyzed with the Pattern-based and Advanced
      Network Analyzer for Clinical Evaluation and Assessment (PANACEA) to explore the 
      association of rATG dosing with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
      (PTLD). RESULTS: Although manual curation was necessary to improve the data
      quality, MedEx and ETHER supported the extraction of the appropriate information.
      We created a final dataset of 1,380 cases with complete information for rATG
      dosing and date of administration. Analysis in PANACEA found that PTLD was
      associated with cumulative doses of rATG >8 mg/kg, even in periods where most of 
      the submissions to FAERS reported low doses of rATG. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated 
      the feasibility of investigating a dose-related safety pattern for a particular
      product in FAERS using a set of automated tools.

AB  - Various techniques have been developed for identifying the most probable
      interactants of a protein under a given biological context. In this article, we
      dissect the effects of the choice of the protein-protein interaction network
      (PPI) and the manipulation of PPI settings on the network neighborhood of the
      influenza A virus (IAV) network, as well as hits in genome-wide small interfering
      RNA screen results for IAV host factors. We investigate the potential of context 
      filtering, which uses text mining evidence linked to PPI edges, as a complement
      to the edge confidence scores typically provided in PPIs for filtering, for
      obtaining more biologically relevant network neighborhoods. Here, we estimate the
      maximum performance of context filtering to isolate a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
      and Genomes (KEGG) network Ki from a union of KEGG networks and its network
      neighborhood. The work gives insights on the use of human PPIs in network
      neighborhood approaches for functional inference.

TI  - Mapping of 79 loci for 83 plasma protein biomarkers in cardiovascular disease.
PG  - e1006706
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006706 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in highly multiplexed immunoassays have allowed systematic
      large-scale measurement of hundreds of plasma proteins in large cohort studies.
      In combination with genotyping, such studies offer the prospect to 1) identify
      mechanisms involved with regulation of protein expression in plasma, and 2)
      determine whether the plasma proteins are likely to be causally implicated in
      disease. We report here the results of genome-wide association (GWA) studies of
      83 proteins considered relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD), measured in
      3,394 individuals with multiple CVD risk factors. We identified 79 genome-wide
      significant (p<5e-8) association signals, 55 of which replicated at P<0.0007 in
      separate validation studies (n = 2,639 individuals). Using automated text mining,
      manual curation, and network-based methods incorporating information on
      expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), we propose plausible causal mechanisms
      for 25 trans-acting loci, including a potential post-translational regulation of 
      stem cell factor by matrix metalloproteinase 9 and receptor-ligand pairs such as 
      RANK-RANK ligand. Using public GWA study data, we further evaluate all 79 loci
      for their causal effect on coronary artery disease, and highlight several
      potentially causal associations. Overall, a majority of the plasma proteins
      studied showed evidence of regulation at the genetic level. Our results enable
      future studies of the causal architecture of human disease, which in turn should 
      aid discovery of new drug targets.

TI  - A neural joint model for entity and relation extraction from biomedical text.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1186/s12859-017-1609-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracting biomedical entities and their relations from text has
      important applications on biomedical research. Previous work primarily utilized
      feature-based pipeline models to process this task. Many efforts need to be made 
      on feature engineering when feature-based models are employed. Moreover, pipeline
      models may suffer error propagation and are not able to utilize the interactions 
      between subtasks. Therefore, we propose a neural joint model to extract
      biomedical entities as well as their relations simultaneously, and it can
      alleviate the problems above. RESULTS: Our model was evaluated on two tasks,
      i.e., the task of extracting adverse drug events between drug and disease
      entities, and the task of extracting resident relations between bacteria and
      location entities. Compared with the state-of-the-art systems in these tasks, our
      model improved the F1 scores of the first task by 5.1% in entity recognition and 
      8.0% in relation extraction, and that of the second task by 9.2% in relation
      extraction. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model achieves competitive performances
      with less work on feature engineering. We demonstrate that the model based on
      neural networks is effective for biomedical entity and relation extraction. In
      addition, parameter sharing is an alternative method for neural models to jointly
      process this task. Our work can facilitate the research on biomedical text
      mining.

TI  - Topic Modeling of Smoking- and Cessation-Related Posts to the American Cancer
      Society's Cancer Survivor Network (CSN): Implications for Cessation Treatment for
      Cancer Survivors Who Smoke.
PG  - 952-959
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntx064 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Smoking is a risk factor in at least 18 cancers, and approximately 
      two-thirds of cancer survivors continue smoking following diagnosis. Text mining 
      of survivors' online posts related to smoking and quitting could inform
      strategies to reduce smoking in this vulnerable population. Methods: We
      identified posts containing smoking/cessation-related keywords from the Cancer
      Survivors Network (CSN), an online cancer survivor community of 166 000 members
      and over 468 000 posts since inception. Unsupervised topic model analysis of
      posts since 2000 using Latent Dirichlet Allocation extracted 70 latent topics
      which two subject experts inspected for themes based on representative terms.
      Posterior analysis assessed the distribution of topics within posts, and the
      range of themes discussed across posts. Results: Less than 1% of posts (n = 3998)
      contained smoking/cessation-related terms, and covered topics related to cancer
      diagnoses, treatments, and coping. The most frequent smoking-related topics were 
      quit smoking methods (5.4% of posts), and the environment for quitters (2.9% of
      posts), such as the stigma associated with being a smoker diagnosed with cancer
      and lack of empathy experienced compared to nonsmokers. Smoking as a risk factor 
      for one's diagnosis was a primary topic in only 1.7% of smoking/cessation-related
      posts. Conclusions: The low frequency of smoking/cessation-related posts may be
      due to expected criticism/stigma for smoking but may also suggests a need for
      health care providers to address smoking and assist with quitting in the
      diagnostic and treatment process. Topic model analysis revealed potential
      barriers that should be addressed in devising clinical or population-level
      interventions for cancer survivors who smoke. Implications: Although smoking is a
      major risk factor for cancer, little is known about cancer patients' or
      survivors' views or concerns about smoking and quitting. This study used text
      mining of posts to an online community of cancer patients and survivors to
      investigate contexts in which smoking or quitting is discussed. Results indicated
      that smoking and quitting discussions were relatively rare, but nevertheless
      provide insight into barriers that may need to be addressed in cessation
      interventions for survivors.

      process for systematic reviews.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systematic Reviews (SRs) are utilized to summarize evidence from high 
      quality studies and are considered the preferred source of evidence-based
      practice (EBP). However, conducting SRs can be time and labor intensive due to
      the high cost of article screening. In previous studies, we demonstrated
      utilizing established (lexical) article relationships to facilitate the
      identification of relevant articles in an efficient and effective manner. Here we
      propose to enhance article relationships with background semantic knowledge
      derived from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts and ontologies.
      METHODS: We developed a pipelined semantic concepts representation process to
      represent articles from an SR into an optimized and enriched semantic space of
      UMLS concepts. Throughout the process, we leveraged concepts and concept
      relations encoded in biomedical ontologies (SNOMED-CT and MeSH) within the UMLS
      framework to prompt concept features of each article. Article relationships
      (similarities) were established and represented as a semantic article network,
      which was readily applied to assist with the article screening process. We
      incorporated the concept of active learning to simulate an interactive article
      recommendation process, and evaluated the performance on 15 completed SRs. We
      used work saved over sampling at 95% recall (WSS95) as the performance measure.
      RESULTS: We compared the WSS95 performance of our ontology-based semantic
      approach to existing lexical feature approaches and corpus-based semantic
      approaches, and found that we had better WSS95 in most SRs. We also had the
      highest average WSS95 of 43.81% and the highest total WSS95 of 657.18%.
      CONCLUSION: We demonstrated using ontology-based semantics to facilitate the
      identification of relevant articles for SRs. Effective concepts and concept
      relations derived from UMLS ontologies can be utilized to establish article
      semantic relationships. Our approach provided a promising performance and can
      easily apply to any SR topics in the biomedical domain with generalizability.

TI  - compMS2Miner: An Automatable Metabolite Identification, Visualization, and
      Data-Sharing R Package for High-Resolution LC-MS Data Sets.
PG  - 3919-3928
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02394 [doi]
AB  - A long-standing challenge of untargeted metabolomic profiling by
      ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry
      (UHPLC-HRMS) is efficient transition from unknown mass spectral features to
      confident metabolite annotations. The compMS(2)Miner (Comprehensive MS(2) Miner) 
      package was developed in the R language to facilitate rapid, comprehensive
      feature annotation using a peak-picker-output and MS(2) data files as inputs. The
      number of MS(2) spectra that can be collected during a metabolomic profiling
      experiment far outweigh the amount of time required for pain-staking manual
      interpretation; therefore, a degree of software workflow autonomy is required for
      broad-scale metabolite annotation. CompMS(2)Miner integrates many useful tools in
      a single workflow for metabolite annotation and also provides a means to overview
      the MS(2) data with a Web application GUI compMS(2)Explorer (Comprehensive MS(2) 
      Explorer) that also facilitates data-sharing and transparency. The automatable
      compMS(2)Miner workflow consists of the following steps: (i) matching unknown
      MS(1) features to precursor MS(2) scans, (ii) filtration of spectral noise
      (dynamic noise filter), (iii) generation of composite mass spectra by multiple
      similar spectrum signal summation and redundant/contaminant spectra removal, (iv)
      interpretation of possible fragment ion substructure using an internal database, 
      (v) annotation of unknowns with chemical and spectral databases with prediction
      of mammalian biotransformation metabolites, wrapper functions for in silico
      fragmentation software, nearest neighbor chemical similarity scoring, random
      forest based retention time prediction, text-mining based false positive
      removal/true positive ranking, chemical taxonomic prediction and differential
      evolution based global annotation score optimization, and (vi) network graph
      visualizations, data curation, and sharing are made possible via the
      compMS(2)Explorer application. Metabolite identities and comments can also be
      recorded using an interactive table within compMS(2)Explorer. The utility of the 
      package is illustrated with a data set of blood serum samples from 7 diet induced
      obese (DIO) and 7 nonobese (NO) C57BL/6J mice, which were also treated with an
      antibiotic (streptomycin) to knockdown the gut microbiota. The results of fully
      autonomous and objective usage of compMS(2)Miner are presented here. All
      automatically annotated spectra output by the workflow are provided in the
      Supporting Information and can alternatively be explored as publically available 
      compMS(2)Explorer applications for both positive and negative modes (
      https://wmbedmands.shinyapps.io/compMS2_mouseSera_POS and
      https://wmbedmands.shinyapps.io/compMS2_mouseSera_NEG ). The workflow provided
      rapid annotation of a diversity of endogenous and gut microbially derived
      metabolites affected by both diet and antibiotic treatment, which conformed to
      previously published reports. Composite spectra (n = 173) were autonomously
      matched to entries of the Massbank of North America (MoNA) spectral repository.
      These experimental and virtual (lipidBlast) spectra corresponded to 29 common
      endogenous compound classes (e.g., 51 lysophosphatidylcholines spectra) and were 
      then used to calculate the ranking capability of 7 individual scoring metrics. It
      was found that an average of the 7 individual scoring metrics provided the most
      effective weighted average ranking ability of 3 for the MoNA matched spectra in
      spite of potential risk of false positive annotations emerging from automation.
      Minor structural differences such as relative carbon-carbon double bond positions
      were found in several cases to affect the correct rank of the MoNA annotated
      metabolite. The latest release and an example workflow is available in the
      package vignette ( https://github.com/WMBEdmands/compMS2Miner ) and a version of 
      the published application is available on the shinyapps.io site (
      https://wmbedmands.shinyapps.io/compMS2Example ).

TI  - KIWI: A technology for public health event monitoring and early warning signal
      detection.
PG  - e208
LID - 10.5210/ojphi.v8i3.6937 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To introduce the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence's
      new Knowledge Integration using Web-based Intelligence (KIWI) technology, and to 
      pefrom preliminary evaluation of the KIWI technology using a case study. The
      purpose of this new technology is to support surveillance activities by
      monitoring unstructured data sources for the early detection and awareness of
      potential public health threats. METHODS: A prototype of the KIWI technology,
      adapted for zoonotic and emerging diseases, was piloted by end-users with
      expertise in the field of public health and zoonotic/emerging disease
      surveillance. The technology was assessed using variables such as geographic
      coverage, user participation, and others; categorized by high-level attributes
      from evaluation guidelines for internet based surveillance systems. Special
      attention was given to the evaluation of the system's automated sense-making
      algorithm, which used variables such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive 
      values. Event-based surveillance evaluation was not applied to its full capacity 
      as such an evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper. RESULTS: KIWI was
      piloted with user participation = 85.0% and geographic coverage within monitored 
      sources = 83.9% of countries. The pilots, which focused on zoonotic and emerging 
      diseases, lasted a combined total of 65 days and resulted in the collection of
      3243 individual information pieces (IIP) and 2 community reported events (CRE)
      for processing. Ten sources were monitored during the second phase of the pilot, 
      which resulted in 545 anticipatory intelligence signals (AIS). KIWI's automated
      sense-making algorithm (SMA) had sensitivity = 63.9% (95% CI: 60.2-67.5%),
      specificity = 88.6% (95% CI: 87.3-89.8%), positive predictive value = 59.8% (95% 
      CI: 56.1-63.4%), and negative predictive value = 90.3% (95% CI: 89.0-91.4%).
      DISCUSSION: Literature suggests the need for internet based monitoring and
      surveillance systems that are customizable, integrated into collaborative
      networks of public health professionals, and incorporated into national
      surveillance activities. Results show that the KIWI technology is well posied to 
      address some of the suggested challenges. A limitation of this study is that
      sample size for pilot participation was small for capturing overall readiness of 
      integrating KIWI into regular surveillance activities. CONCLUSIONS: KIWI is a
      customizable technology developed within an already thriving collaborative
      platform used by public health professionals, and performs well as a tool for
      discipline-specific event monitoring and early warning signal detection.

TI  - Systematic analysis of molecular mechanisms for HCC metastasis via text mining
      approach.
PG  - 13909-13916
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.14692 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically explore the molecular mechanism for hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) metastasis and identify regulatory genes with text mining
      methods. RESULTS: Genes with highest frequencies and significant pathways related
      to HCC metastasis were listed. A handful of proteins such as EGFR, MDM2, TP53 and
      APP, were identified as hub nodes in PPI (protein-protein interaction) network.
      Compared with unique genes for HBV-HCCs, genes particular to HCV-HCCs were less, 
      but may participate in more extensive signaling processes. VEGFA, PI3KCA, MAPK1, 
      MMP9 and other genes may play important roles in multiple phenotypes of
      metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genes in abstracts of HCC-metastasis
      literatures were identified. Word frequency analysis, KEGG pathway and PPI
      network analysis were performed. Then co-occurrence analysis between genes and
      metastasis-related phenotypes were carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Text mining is
      effective for revealing potential regulators or pathways, but the purpose of it
      should be specific, and the combination of various methods will be more useful.

TI  - ARN: Analysis and Visualization System for Adipogenic Regulation Network
      Information.
PG  - 39347
LID - 10.1038/srep39347 [doi]
AB  - Adipogenesis is the process of cell differentiation through which preadipocytes
      become adipocytes. Lots of research is currently ongoing to identify genes,
      including their gene products and microRNAs, that correlate with fat cell
      development. However, information fragmentation hampers the identification of key
      regulatory genes and pathways. Here, we present a database of literature-curated 
      adipogenesis-related regulatory interactions, designated the Adipogenesis
      Regulation Network (ARN, http://210.27.80.93/arn/), which currently contains 3101
      nodes (genes and microRNAs), 1863 regulatory interactions, and 33,969 expression 
      records associated with adipogenesis, based on 1619 papers. A sentence-based
      text-mining approach was employed for efficient manual curation of regulatory
      interactions from approximately 37,000 PubMed abstracts. Additionally, we further
      determined 13,103 possible node relationships by searching miRGate, BioGRID,
      PAZAR and TRRUST. ARN also has several useful features: i) regulatory map
      information; ii) tests to examine the impact of a query node on adipogenesis;
      iii) tests for the interactions and modes of a query node; iv) prediction of
      interactions of a query node; and v) analysis of experimental data or the
      construction of hypotheses related to adipogenesis. In summary, ARN can store,
      retrieve and analyze adipogenesis-related information as well as support ongoing 
      adipogenesis research and contribute to the discovery of key regulatory genes and
      pathways.

TI  - The landscape of microbial phenotypic traits and associated genes.
PG  - 10074-10090
AB  - Bacteria and Archaea display a variety of phenotypic traits and can adapt to
      diverse ecological niches. However, systematic annotation of prokaryotic
      phenotypes is lacking. We have therefore developed ProTraits, a resource
      containing approximately 545 000 novel phenotype inferences, spanning 424 traits 
      assigned to 3046 bacterial and archaeal species. These annotations were assigned 
      by a computational pipeline that associates microbes with phenotypes by
      text-mining the scientific literature and the broader World Wide Web, while also 
      being able to define novel concepts from unstructured text. Moreover, the
      ProTraits pipeline assigns phenotypes by drawing extensively on comparative
      genomics, capturing patterns in gene repertoires, codon usage biases, proteome
      composition and co-occurrence in metagenomes. Notably, we find that gene synteny 
      is highly predictive of many phenotypes, and highlight examples of gene
      neighborhoods associated with spore-forming ability. A global analysis of trait
      interrelatedness outlined clusters in the microbial phenotype network, suggesting
      common genetic underpinnings. Our extended set of phenotype annotations allows
      detection of 57 088 high confidence gene-trait links, which recover many known
      associations involving sporulation, flagella, catalase activity, aerobicity,
      photosynthesis and other traits. Over 99% of the commonly occurring gene families
      are involved in genetic interactions conditional on at least one phenotype,
      suggesting that epistasis has a major role in shaping microbial gene content.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the most common type
      of dementia, has brought a heavy economic burden to healthcare system around the 
      world. However, currently there is still lack of effective treatment for AD
      patients. Herbal medicines, featured as multiple herbs, ingredients and targets, 
      have accumulated a great deal of valuable experience in treating AD although the 
      exact molecular mechanisms are still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this
      investigation, we proposed a network pharmacology-based method, which combined
      large-scale text-mining, drug-likeness filtering, target prediction and network
      analysis to decipher the mechanisms of action for the most widely studied
      medicinal herbs in AD treatment. RESULTS: The text mining of PubMed resulted in
      10 herbs exhibiting significant correlations with AD. Subsequently, after
      drug-likeness filtering, 1016 compounds were remaining for 10 herbs, followed by 
      structure clustering to sum up chemical scaffolds of herb ingredients. Based on
      target prediction results performed by our in-house protocol named AlzhCPI,
      compound-target (C-T) and target-pathway (T-P) networks were constructed to
      decipher the mechanism of action for anti-AD herbs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this
      approach provided a novel strategy to explore the mechanisms of herbal medicine
      from a holistic perspective.

TI  - Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions by Evidence Combining Methods.
LID - E1946 [pii]
AB  - Most cellular functions involve proteins' features based on their physical
      interactions with other partner proteins. Sketching a map of protein-protein
      interactions (PPIs) is therefore an important inception step towards
      understanding the basics of cell functions. Several experimental techniques
      operating in vivo or in vitro have made significant contributions to screening a 
      large number of protein interaction partners, especially high-throughput
      experimental methods. However, computational approaches for PPI predication
      supported by rapid accumulation of data generated from experimental techniques,
      3D structure definitions, and genome sequencing have boosted the map sketching of
      PPIs. In this review, we shed light on in silico PPI prediction methods that
      integrate evidence from multiple sources, including evolutionary relationship,
      function annotation, sequence/structure features, network topology and text
      mining. These methods are developed for integration of multi-dimensional
      evidence, for designing the strategies to predict novel interactions, and for
      making the results consistent with the increase of prediction coverage and
      accuracy.

TI  - A systems study reveals concurrent activation of AMPK and mTOR by amino acids.
PG  - 13254
LID - 10.1038/ncomms13254 [doi]
AB  - Amino acids (aa) are not only building blocks for proteins, but also signalling
      molecules, with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) acting as a 
      key mediator. However, little is known about whether aa, independently of mTORC1,
      activate other kinases of the mTOR signalling network. To delineate aa-stimulated
      mTOR network dynamics, we here combine a computational-experimental approach with
      text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2
      (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. 
      AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
      kinase beta (CaMKKbeta). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators
      Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1
      antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK
      concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain
      autophagy. This may be required to maintain protein homoeostasis and deliver
      metabolite intermediates for biosynthetic processes.

TI  - A New Data Representation Based on Training Data Characteristics to Extract Drug 
      Name Entity in Medical Text.
PG  - 3483528
AB  - One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug name
      recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the medical text
      mining poses more challenges, for example, more unstructured text, the fast
      growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same drug, 
      the lack of labeled dataset sources and external knowledge, and the multiple
      token representations for a single drug name. Although many approaches have been 
      proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems remained with poor F-score
      performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a new treatment in data
      representation techniques to overcome some of those challenges. We propose three 
      data representation techniques based on the characteristics of word distribution 
      and word similarities as a result of word embedding training. The first technique
      is evaluated with the standard NN model, that is, MLP. The second technique
      involves two deep network classifiers, that is, DBN and SAE. The third technique 
      represents the sentence as a sequence that is evaluated with a recurrent NN
      model, that is, LSTM. In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique
      gives the best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its
      average F-score being 0.8645.

TI  - Efficient Results in Semantic Interoperability for Health Care. Findings from the
      Section on Knowledge Representation and Management.
PG  - 184-187
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize excellent current research in the field of Knowledge
      Representation and Management (KRM) within the health and medical care domain.
      METHOD: We provide a synopsis of the 2016 IMIA selected articles as well as a
      related synthetic overview of the current and future field activities. A first
      step of the selection was performed through MEDLINE querying with a list of MeSH 
      descriptors completed by a list of terms adapted to the KRM section. The second
      step of the selection was completed by the two section editors who separately
      evaluated the set of 1,432 articles. The third step of the selection consisted of
      a collective work that merged the evaluation results to retain 15 articles for
      peer-review. RESULTS: The selection and evaluation process of this Yearbook's
      section on Knowledge Representation and Management has yielded four excellent and
      interesting articles regarding semantic interoperability for health care by
      gathering heterogeneous sources (knowledge and data) and auditing ontologies. In 
      the first article, the authors present a solution based on standards and Semantic
      Web technologies to access distributed and heterogeneous datasets in the domain
      of breast cancer clinical trials. The second article describes a knowledge-based 
      recommendation system that relies on ontologies and Semantic Web rules in the
      context of chronic diseases dietary. The third article is related to
      concept-recognition and text-mining to derive common human diseases model and a
      phenotypic network of common diseases. In the fourth article, the authors
      highlight the need for auditing the SNOMED CT. They propose to use a crowdbased
      method for ontology engineering. CONCLUSIONS: The current research activities
      further illustrate the continuous convergence of Knowledge Representation and
      Medical Informatics, with a focus this year on dedicated tools and methods to
      advance clinical care by proposing solutions to cope with the problem of semantic
      interoperability. Indeed, there is a need for powerful tools able to manage and
      interpret complex, large-scale and distributed datasets and knowledge bases, but 
      also a need for user-friendly tools developed for the clinicians in their daily
      practice.

AB  - Does "the motor system" play "a role" in speech perception? If so, where, how,
      and when? We conducted a systematic review that addresses these questions using
      both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative review of behavioural,
      computational modelling, non-human animal, brain damage/disorder, electrical
      stimulation/recording, and neuroimaging research suggests that distributed brain 
      regions involved in producing speech play specific, dynamic, and contextually
      determined roles in speech perception. The quantitative review employed region
      and network based neuroimaging meta-analyses and a novel text mining method to
      describe relative contributions of nodes in distributed brain networks.
      Supporting the qualitative review, results show a specific functional
      correspondence between regions involved in non-linguistic movement of the
      articulators, covertly and overtly producing speech, and the perception of both
      nonword and word sounds. This distributed set of cortical and subcortical speech 
      production regions are ubiquitously active and form multiple networks whose
      topologies dynamically change with listening context. Results are inconsistent
      with motor and acoustic only models of speech perception and classical and
      contemporary dual-stream models of the organization of language and the brain.
      Instead, results are more consistent with complex network models in which
      multiple speech production related networks and subnetworks dynamically
      self-organize to constrain interpretation of indeterminant acoustic patterns as
      listening context requires.

TI  - Identification of a RAI1-associated disease network through integration of exome 
      sequencing, transcriptomics, and 3D genomics.
PG  - 105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a developmental disability/multiple
      congenital anomaly disorder resulting from haploinsufficiency of RAI1. It is
      characterized by distinctive facial features, brachydactyly, sleep disturbances, 
      and stereotypic behaviors. METHODS: We investigated a cohort of 15 individuals
      with a clinical suspicion of SMS who showed neither deletion in the SMS critical 
      region nor damaging variants in RAI1 using whole exome sequencing. A combination 
      of network analysis (co-expression and biomedical text mining), transcriptomics, 
      and circularized chromatin conformation capture (4C-seq) was applied to verify
      whether modified genes are part of the same disease network as known SMS-causing 
      genes. RESULTS: Potentially deleterious variants were identified in nine of these
      individuals using whole-exome sequencing. Eight of these changes affect KMT2D,
      ZEB2, MAP2K2, GLDC, CASK, MECP2, KDM5C, and POGZ, known to be associated with
      Kabuki syndrome 1, Mowat-Wilson syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, glycine 
      encephalopathy, mental retardation and microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar
      hypoplasia, X-linked mental retardation 13, X-linked mental retardation
      Claes-Jensen type, and White-Sutton syndrome, respectively. The ninth individual 
      carries a de novo variant in JAKMIP1, a regulator of neuronal translation that
      was recently found deleted in a patient with autism spectrum disorder. Analyses
      of co-expression and biomedical text mining suggest that these pathologies and
      SMS are part of the same disease network. Further support for this hypothesis was
      obtained from transcriptome profiling that showed that the expression levels of
      both Zeb2 and Map2k2 are perturbed in Rai1 (-/-) mice. As an orthogonal approach 
      to potentially contributory disease gene variants, we used chromatin conformation
      capture to reveal chromatin contacts between RAI1 and the loci flanking ZEB2 and 
      GLDC, as well as between RAI1 and human orthologs of the genes that show
      perturbed expression in our Rai1 (-/-) mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: These holistic
      studies of RAI1 and its interactions allow insights into SMS and other disorders 
      associated with intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities. Our
      findings support a pan-genomic approach to the molecular diagnosis of a
      distinctive disorder.

TI  - Prioritization, clustering and functional annotation of MicroRNAs using latent
      semantic indexing of MEDLINE abstracts.
PG  - 350
AB  - BACKGROUND: The amount of scientific information about MicroRNAs (miRNAs) is
      growing exponentially, making it difficult for researchers to interpret
      experimental results. In this study, we present an automated text mining approach
      using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for prioritization, clustering and
      functional annotation of miRNAs. RESULTS: For approximately 900 human miRNAs
      indexed in miRBase, text documents were created by concatenating titles and
      abstracts of MEDLINE citations which refer to the miRNAs. The documents were
      parsed and a weighted term-by-miRNA frequency matrix was created, which was
      subsequently factorized via singular value decomposition to extract pair-wise
      cosine values between the term (keyword) and miRNA vectors in reduced rank
      semantic space. LSI enables derivation of both explicit and implicit associations
      between entities based on word usage patterns. Using miR2Disease as a gold
      standard, we found that LSI identified keyword-to-miRNA relationships with high
      accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that pair-wise associations between miRNAs 
      can be used to group them into categories which are functionally aligned.
      Finally, term ranking by querying the LSI space with a group of miRNAs enabled
      annotation of the clusters with functionally related terms. CONCLUSIONS: LSI
      modeling of MEDLINE abstracts provides a robust and automated method for miRNA
      related knowledge discovery. The latest collection of miRNA abstracts and LSI
      model can be accessed through the web tool miRNA Literature Network (miRLiN) at
      http://bioinfo.memphis.edu/mirlin .

TI  - A novel strategy of profiling the mechanism of herbal medicines by combining
      network pharmacology with plasma concentration determination and affinity
      constant measurement.
PG  - 3347-3356
AB  - Herbal medicines have long been widely used in the treatment of various complex
      diseases in China. However, the active constituents and therapeutic mechanisms of
      many herbal medicines remain undefined. Therefore, the identification of the
      active components and target proteins in these herbal medicines is a formidable
      task in herbal medicine research. In this study, we proposed a strategy, which
      integrates network pharmacology with biomedical analysis and surface plasmon
      resonance (SPR) to predict the active ingredients and potential targets of herbal
      medicine Sophora flavescens or Kushen in Chinese, and evaluate its anti-fibrosis 
      activity. First, we applied a virtual HTDocking platform to predict the potential
      targets of Kushen related to liver fibrosis by selecting five crucial protein
      targets based on network parameters and text mining. Then, we identified nine
      components in mice plasma after oral administration of Kushen extract and
      determined the plasma concentration of each compound. Binding affinities between 
      the nine potential active compounds and five target proteins were detected by SPR
      assays. Finally, we constructed a multi-parameter network model on the basis of
      three important parameters to tentatively explain the anti-fibrosis mechanism of 
      Kushen. The results not only provide evidence for the therapeutic mechanism of
      Kushen but also shed new light on the activity-based analysis of other Chinese
      herbal medicines.

AB  - Endometriosis affects 5-10% of women in reproductive age, leading to
      dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and infertility; however, our understanding on the
      pathogenesis of this disease remains incomplete. In the present study, we
      performed a systematic analysis of endometriosis-related genes using text mining.
      Taking text mining results as input, we subsequently generated a filtered gene
      set by computing the likelihood of finding more than expected occurrences for
      every gene across the disease-centered subset of the PubMed database.
      Characterization of this filtered gene set by gene ontology, pathway and network 
      analysis provides clues to the multiple mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible
      for the establishment of ectopic endometrial tissues, including the migration,
      implantation, survival and proliferation of ectopic endometrial cells. Finally,
      using this gene set as "seed", we scanned human genome to predict novel candidate
      genes based on gene annotations from multiple databases. Our study provides
      in-depth insights into the pathogenesis of endometriosis.

AB  - In order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying any disease, knowledge 
      about the interacting proteins in the disease pathway is essential. The number of
      revealed protein-protein interactions (PPI) is still very limited compared to the
      available protein sequences of different organisms. Experiment based
      high-throughput technologies though provide some data about these interactions,
      those are often fairly noisy. Computational techniques for predicting
      protein-protein interactions therefore assume significance. 1296 binary
      fingerprints that encode a combination of structural and geometric properties
      were developed using the crystallographic data of 15,000 protein complexes in the
      pdb server. In a case study, these fingerprints were created for proteins
      implicated in the Type 2 diabetes mellitus disease. The fingerprints were input
      into a SVM based model for discriminating disease proteins from non disease
      proteins yielding a classification accuracy of 78.2% (AUC value of 0.78) on an
      external data set composed of proteins retrieved via text mining of diabetes
      related literature. A PPI network was constructed and analysed to explore new
      disease targets. The integrated approach exemplified here has a potential for
      identifying disease related proteins, functional annotation and other proteomics 
      studies.

TI  - The BEL information extraction workflow (BELIEF): evaluation in the BioCreative V
      BEL and IAT track.
LID - baw136 [pii]
AB  - Network-based approaches have become extremely important in systems biology to
      achieve a better understanding of biological mechanisms. For network
      representation, the Biological Expression Language (BEL) is well designed to
      collate findings from the scientific literature into biological network models.
      To facilitate encoding and biocuration of such findings in BEL, a BEL Information
      Extraction Workflow (BELIEF) was developed. BELIEF provides a web-based curation 
      interface, the BELIEF Dashboard, that incorporates text mining techniques to
      support the biocurator in the generation of BEL networks. The underlying
      UIMA-based text mining pipeline (BELIEF Pipeline) uses several named entity
      recognition processes and relationship extraction methods to detect concepts and 
      BEL relationships in literature. The BELIEF Dashboard allows easy curation of the
      automatically generated BEL statements and their context annotations. Resulting
      BEL statements and their context annotations can be syntactically and
      semantically verified to ensure consistency in the BEL network. In summary, the
      workflow supports experts in different stages of systems biology network
      building. Based on the BioCreative V BEL track evaluation, we show that the
      BELIEF Pipeline automatically extracts relationships with an F-score of 36.4% and
      fully correct statements can be obtained with an F-score of 30.8%. Participation 
      in the BioCreative V Interactive task (IAT) track with BELIEF revealed a systems 
      usability scale (SUS) of 67. Considering the complexity of the task for new
      users-learning BEL, working with a completely new interface, and performing
      complex curation-a score so close to the overall SUS average highlights the
      usability of BELIEF.Database URL: BELIEF is available at

      Comparison among Human-Made and Text Mining-Based Models.
PG  - 9795409
LID - 10.1155/2016/9795409 [doi]
AB  - Here we realized a networks-based model representing the process of actin
      remodelling that occurs during the acquisition of fertilizing ability of human
      spermatozoa (HumanMade_ActinSpermNetwork, HM_ASN). Then, we compared it with the 
      networks provided by two different text mining tools: Agilent Literature Search
      (ALS) and PESCADOR. As a reference, we used the data from the online repository
      Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), referred to the actin dynamics
      in a more general biological context. We found that HM_ALS and the networks from 
      KEGG data shared the same scale-free topology following the Barabasi-Albert
      model, thus suggesting that the information is spread within the network quickly 
      and efficiently. On the contrary, the networks obtained by ALS and PESCADOR have 
      a scale-free hierarchical architecture, which implies a different pattern of
      information transmission. Also, the hubs identified within the networks are
      different: HM_ALS and KEGG networks contain as hubs several molecules known to be
      involved in actin signalling; ALS was unable to find other hubs than "actin,"
      whereas PESCADOR gave some nonspecific result. This seems to suggest that the
      human-made information retrieval in the case of a specific event, such as actin
      dynamics in human spermatozoa, could be a reliable strategy.

AB  - Automatic analysis of increasingly growing literature repositories including data
      integration to other databases is a powerful tool to propose hypothesis that can 
      be used to plan experiments to validate or disprove the hypothesis. Furthermore, 
      it provides means to evaluate the redundancy of research line in comparison to
      the published literature. This is potentially beneficial for those developing
      research in a specific disease which are interested in exploring a particular
      pathway or set of genes/proteins. In the scope of the integrating book a case
      will be made addressing proteostasis factors in cancer. The maintenance of
      proteome homeostasis, known as proteostasis, is a process by which cells regulate
      protein translation, degradation, subcellular localization, and protein folding
      and consists of an integrated network of proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome
      system plays a key role in essential biological processes such as cell cycle, DNA
      damage repair, membrane trafficking, and maintaining protein homeostasis. Cells
      maintain proteostasis by regulating protein translation, degradation, subcellular
      localization, and protein folding. Aberrant proteostasis leads to
      loss-of-function diseases (cystic fibrosis) and gain-of-toxic-function diseases
      (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease). Cancer therapy on the other
      hand explores inhibition of proteostasis factors to trigger endoplasmic reticulum
      stress with subsequent apoptosis. Alternatively therapies target deubiquitinases 
      and thereby regulate tumor promoters or suppressors. Furthermore, mutations in
      specific proteostasis factors are associated with higher risk for specific
      cancers, e.g., BRCA mutations in breast cancer. This chapter discusses
      proteostasis protein factors' association with cancer from a literature mining
      perspective.

TI  - Corpus domain effects on distributional semantic modeling of medical terms.
PG  - 3635-3644
AB  - MOTIVATION: Automatically quantifying semantic similarity and relatedness between
      clinical terms is an important aspect of text mining from electronic health
      records, which are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of phenotypic
      information for clinical genomics and bioinformatics research. A key obstacle to 
      development of semantic relatedness measures is the limited availability of large
      quantities of clinical text to researchers and developers outside of major
      medical centers. Text from general English and biomedical literature are freely
      available; however, their validity as a substitute for clinical domain to
      represent semantics of clinical terms remains to be demonstrated. RESULTS: We
      constructed neural network representations of clinical terms found in a publicly 
      available benchmark dataset manually labeled for semantic similarity and
      relatedness. Similarity and relatedness measures computed from text corpora in
      three domains (Clinical Notes, PubMed Central articles and Wikipedia) were
      compared using the benchmark as reference. We found that measures computed from
      full text of biomedical articles in PubMed Central repository (rho = 0.62 for
      similarity and 0.58 for relatedness) are on par with measures computed from
      clinical reports (rho = 0.60 for similarity and 0.57 for relatedness). We also
      evaluated the use of neural network based relatedness measures for query
      expansion in a clinical document retrieval task and a biomedical term word sense 
      disambiguation task. We found that, with some limitations, biomedical articles
      may be used in lieu of clinical reports to represent the semantics of clinical
      terms and that distributional semantic methods are useful for clinical and
      biomedical natural language processing applications. AVAILABILITY AND
      IMPLEMENTATION: The software and reference standards used in this study to
      evaluate semantic similarity and relatedness measures are publicly available as
      detailed in the article. CONTACT: pakh0002@umn.eduSupplementary information:

TI  - A Knowledge Map for Hospital Performance Concept: Extraction and Analysis: A
      Narrative Review Article.
PG  - 843-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Performance is a multi-dimensional and dynamic concept. During the
      past 2 decades, considerable studies were performed in developing the hospital
      performance concept. To know literature key concepts on hospital performance, the
      knowledge visualization based on co-word analysis and social network analysis has
      been used. METHODS: Documents were identified through "PubMed" searching from
      1945 to 2014 and 2350 papers entered the study after omitting unrelated articles,
      the duplicates, and articles without abstract. After pre-processing and preparing
      articles, the key words were extracted and terms were weighted by TF-IDF
      weighting schema. Support as an interestingness measure, which considers the
      co-occurrence of the extracted keywords and "hospital performance" phrase was
      calculated. Keywords having high support with "hospital performance" are
      selected. Term-term matrix of these selected keywords is calculated and the graph
      is extracted. RESULTS: The most high frequency words after "Hospital Performance"
      were "mortality" and "efficiency". The major knowledge structure of hospital
      performance literature during these years shows that the keyword "mortality" had 
      the highest support with hospital performance followed by "quality of care",
      "quality improvement", "discharge", "length of stay" and "clinical outcome". The 
      strongest relationship is seen between "electronic medical record" and
      "readmission rate". CONCLUSION: Some dimensions of hospital performance are more 
      important such as "efficiency", "effectiveness", "quality" and "safety" and some 
      indicators are more highlighted such as "mortality", "length of stay",
      "readmission rate" and "patient satisfaction". In the last decade, some concepts 
      became more significant in hospital performance literature such as "mortality",
      "quality of care" and "quality improvement".

TI  - Gene-Disease Interaction Retrieval from Multiple Sources: A Network Based Method.
PG  - 3594517
LID - 10.1155/2016/3594517 [doi]
AB  - The number of gene-related databases has been growing largely along with the
      research on genes of bioinformatics. Those databases are filled with various gene
      functions, pathways, interactions, and so forth, while much biomedical knowledge 
      about human diseases is stored as text in all kinds of literatures. Researchers
      have developed many methods to extract structured biomedical knowledge. Some
      study and improve text mining algorithms to achieve efficiency in order to cover 
      as many data sources as possible, while some build open source database to accept
      individual submissions in order to achieve accuracy. This paper combines both
      efforts and biomedical ontologies to build an interaction network of multiple
      biomedical ontologies, which guarantees its robustness as well as its wide
      coverage of biomedical publications. Upon the network, we accomplish an algorithm
      which discovers paths between concept pairs and shows potential relations.

AB  - We have developed a Decision Support Environment (DSE) for medical experts at the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DSE contains two integrated systems:
      The Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records (ETHER) and the
      Pattern-based and Advanced Network Analyzer for Clinical Evaluation and
      Assessment (PANACEA). These systems assist medical experts in reviewing reports
      submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the FDA
      Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). In this manuscript, we describe the DSE
      architecture and key functionalities, and examine its potential contributions to 
      the signal management process by focusing on four use cases: the identification
      of missing cases from a case series, the identification of duplicate case
      reports, retrieving cases for a case series analysis, and community detection for
      signal identification and characterization.

TI  - Drug drug interaction extraction from biomedical literature using syntax
      convolutional neural network.
PG  - 3444-3453
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw486 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Detecting drug-drug interaction (DDI) has become a vital part of
      public health safety. Therefore, using text mining techniques to extract DDIs
      from biomedical literature has received great attentions. However, this research 
      is still at an early stage and its performance has much room to improve. RESULTS:
      In this article, we present a syntax convolutional neural network (SCNN) based
      DDI extraction method. In this method, a novel word embedding, syntax word
      embedding, is proposed to employ the syntactic information of a sentence. Then
      the position and part of speech features are introduced to extend the embedding
      of each word. Later, auto-encoder is introduced to encode the traditional
      bag-of-words feature (sparse 0-1 vector) as the dense real value vector. Finally,
      a combination of embedding-based convolutional features and traditional features 
      are fed to the softmax classifier to extract DDIs from biomedical literature.
      Experimental results on the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus show that SCNN obtains a
      better performance (an F-score of 0.686) than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study on disease-disease association has been increasingly viewed
      and analyzed as a network, in which the connections between diseases are
      configured using the source information on interactome maps of biomolecules such 
      as genes, proteins, metabolites, etc. Although abundance in source information
      leads to tighter connections between diseases in the network, for a certain group
      of diseases, such as metabolic diseases, the connections do not occur much due to
      insufficient source information; a large proportion of their associated genes are
      still unknown. One way to circumvent the difficulties in the lack of source
      information is to integrate available external information by using one of
      up-to-date integration or fusion methods. However, if one wants a disease network
      placing huge emphasis on the original source of data but still utilizing external
      sources only to complement it, integration may not be pertinent. Interpretation
      on the integrated network would be ambiguous: meanings conferred on edges would
      be vague due to fused information. METHODS: In this study, we propose a network
      based algorithm that complements the original network by utilizing external
      information while preserving the network's originality. The proposed algorithm
      links the disconnected node to the disease network by using complementary
      information from external data source through four steps: anchoring, connecting, 
      scoring, and stopping. RESULTS: When applied to the network of metabolic diseases
      that is sourced from protein-protein interaction data, the proposed algorithm
      recovered connections by 97%, and improved the AUC performance up to 0.71 (lifted
      from 0.55) by using the external information outsourced from text mining results 
      on PubMed comorbidity literatures. Experimental results also show that the
      proposed algorithm is robust to noisy external information. CONCLUSION: This
      research has novelty in which the proposed algorithm preserves the network's
      originality, but at the same time, complements it by utilizing external
      information. Furthermore it can be utilized for original association recovery and
      novel association discovery for disease network.

TI  - Link Prediction on a Network of Co-occurring MeSH Terms: Towards Literature-based
      Discovery.
PG  - 340-6
LID - 10.3414/ME15-01-0108 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Literature-based discovery (LBD) is a text mining methodology for
      automatically generating research hypotheses from existing knowledge. We mimic
      the process of LBD as a classification problem on a graph of MeSH terms. We
      employ unsupervised and supervised link prediction methods for predicting
      previously unknown connections between biomedical concepts. METHODS: We evaluate 
      the effectiveness of link prediction through a series of experiments using a MeSH
      network that contains the history of link formation between biomedical concepts. 
      We performed link prediction using proximity measures, such as common neighbor
      (CN), Jaccard coefficient (JC), Adamic / Adar index (AA) and preferential
      attachment (PA). Our approach relies on the assumption that similar nodes are
      more likely to establish a link in the future. RESULTS: Applying an unsupervised 
      approach, the AA measure achieved the best performance in terms of area under the
      ROC curve (AUC = 0.76), followed by CN, JC, and PA. In a supervised approach, we 
      evaluate whether proximity measures can be combined to define a model of link
      formation across all four predictors. We applied various classifiers, including
      decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, 
      naive Bayes, and random forests. Random forest classifier accomplishes the best
      performance (AUC = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The link prediction approach proved to be 
      effective for LBD processing. Supervised statistical learning approaches clearly 
      outperform an unsupervised approach to link prediction.

TI  - BioCreative V track 4: a shared task for the extraction of causal network
      information using the Biological Expression Language.
LID - 10.1093/database/baw067 [doi]
LID - baw067 [pii]
AB  - Automatic extraction of biological network information is one of the most desired
      and most complex tasks in biological and medical text mining. Track 4 at
      BioCreative V attempts to approach this complexity using fragments of large-scale
      manually curated biological networks, represented in Biological Expression
      Language (BEL), as training and test data. BEL is an advanced knowledge
      representation format which has been designed to be both human readable and
      machine processable. The specific goal of track 4 was to evaluate text mining
      systems capable of automatically constructing BEL statements from given evidence 
      text, and of retrieving evidence text for given BEL statements. Given the
      complexity of the task, we designed an evaluation methodology which gives credit 
      to partially correct statements. We identified various levels of information
      expressed by BEL statements, such as entities, functions, relations, and
      introduced an evaluation framework which rewards systems capable of delivering
      useful BEL fragments at each of these levels. The aim of this evaluation method
      is to help identify the characteristics of the systems which, if combined, would 
      be most useful for achieving the overall goal of automatically constructing
      causal biological networks from text.

PG  - 2695-2700
LID - 10.4268/cjcmm20161421 [doi]
AB  - This paper was aimed to explore the relationship between Artemisia annua and
      tumor, and investigate its anti-tumor mechanism based on the bioinformatics
      molecular network analysis, text mining technique and other related methods. Text
      mining tool Polysearch database was used to get the information, and after
      formatting conversion, the information was imported into the bioinformatics
      analysis software Cytoscape3.2.1 for visualization and subsequent bioinformatics 
      molecular network analysis .It was shown that the A. annua was associated with
      the tumor by 8 key proteins TNF,VEGF,PI3K, ALDH1, Bcl-2, MicroRNA, p38 and CASP3 
      by text mining technique. The main biological processes involved in its
      anti-tumor effect included cell cycle, post-translational protein modification,
      cell cycle regulation, protein ubiquitination and organelle tissues regulation.
      The key network analysis showed that the action may be achieved by regulation of 
      triglyceride metabolic process, positive regulation of triglyceride metabolic
      process, positive regulation of triglyceride catabolic process, regulation of
      budding cell apical bud growth, negative regulation of mitotic cell cycle,
      negative regulation of meiotic cell cycle, and positive regulation of
      transcription factors. The results showed that the anti-tumor effect of A. annua 
      may be associated with regulating lipid metabolism of tumor cells, decomposing
      large amounts of lipids, releasing energy, reducing the rate of tumor cell
      division and accelerating tumor cell apoptosis.

TI  - @MInter: automated text-mining of microbial interactions.
PG  - 2981-7
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw357 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Microbial consortia are frequently defined by numerous interactions
      within the community that are key to understanding their function. While
      microbial interactions have been extensively studied experimentally, information 
      regarding them is dispersed in the scientific literature. As manual collation is 
      an infeasible option, automated data processing tools are needed to make this
      information easily accessible. RESULTS: We present @MInter, an automated
      information extraction system based on Support Vector Machines to analyze paper
      abstracts and infer microbial interactions. @MInter was trained and tested on a
      manually curated gold standard dataset of 735 species interactions and 3917
      annotated abstracts, constructed as part of this study. Cross-validation analysis
      showed that @MInter was able to detect abstracts pertaining to one or more
      microbial interactions with high specificity (specificity = 95%, AUC = 0.97).
      Despite challenges in identifying specific microbial interactions in an abstract 
      (interaction level recall = 95%, precision = 25%), @MInter was shown to reduce
      annotator workload 13-fold compared to alternate approaches. Applying @MInter to 
      175 bacterial species abundant on human skin, we identified a network of 357
      literature-reported microbial interactions, demonstrating its utility for the
      study of microbial communities. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: @MInter is

TI  - DermO; an ontology for the description of dermatologic disease.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/s13326-016-0085-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been repeated initiatives to produce standard nosologies
      and terminologies for cutaneous disease, some dedicated to the domain and some
      part of bigger terminologies such as ICD-10. Recently, formally structured
      terminologies, ontologies, have been widely developed in many areas of biomedical
      research. Primarily, these address the aim of providing comprehensive working
      terminologies for domains of knowledge, but because of the knowledge contained in
      the relationships between terms they can also be used computationally for many
      purposes. RESULTS: We have developed an ontology of cutaneous disease,
      constructed manually by domain experts. With more than 3000 terms, DermO
      represents the most comprehensive formal dermatological disease terminology
      available. The disease entities are categorized in 20 upper level terms, which
      use a variety of features such as anatomical location, heritability, affected
      cell or tissue type, or etiology, as the features for classification, in line
      with professional practice and nosology in dermatology. Available in OBO flatfile
      and OWL 2 formats, it is integrated semantically with other ontologies and
      terminologies describing diseases and phenotypes. We demonstrate the application 
      of DermO to text mining the biomedical literature and in the creation of a
      network describing the phenotypic relationships between cutaneous diseases.
      CONCLUSIONS: DermO is an ontology with broad coverage of the domain of
      dermatologic disease and we demonstrate here its utility for text mining and
      investigation of phenotypic relationships between dermatologic disorders. We
      envision that in the future it may be applied to the creation and mining of
      electronic health records, clinical training and basic research, as it supports
      automated inference and reasoning, and for the broader integration of skin
      disease information with that from other domains.

TI  - Systematic analysis of the molecular mechanism underlying atherosclerosis using a
      text mining approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is one of the common health threats all over the
      world. It is a complex heritable disease that affects arterial blood vessels.
      Chronic inflammatory response plays an important role in atherogenesis. There has
      been little success in fully identifying functionally important genes in the
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. RESULTS: In the present study, we performed a
      systematic analysis of atherosclerosis-related genes using text mining. We
      identified a total of 1312 genes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that a
      total of 35 terms exhibited significance (p < 0.05) as overrepresented terms,
      indicating that atherosclerosis invokes many genes with a wide range of different
      functions. Pathway analysis demonstrated that the most highly enriched pathway is
      the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Finally, through gene network analysis,
      we prioritized 48 genes using the hub gene method. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
      provides a valuable resource for the in-depth understanding of the mechanism
      underlying atherosclerosis.

TI  - MET network in PubMed: a text-mined network visualization and curation system.

LID - baw090 [pii]
AB  - Metastasis is the dissemination of a cancer/tumor from one organ to another, and 
      it is the most dangerous stage during cancer progression, causing more than 90%
      of cancer deaths. Improving the understanding of the complicated cellular
      mechanisms underlying metastasis requires investigations of the signaling
      pathways. To this end, we developed a METastasis (MET) network visualization and 
      curation tool to assist metastasis researchers retrieve network information of
      interest while browsing through the large volume of studies in PubMed. MET can
      recognize relations among genes, cancers, tissues and organs of metastasis
      mentioned in the literature through text-mining techniques, and then produce a
      visualization of all mined relations in a metastasis network. To facilitate the
      curation process, MET is developed as a browser extension that allows curators to
      review and edit concepts and relations related to metastasis directly in PubMed. 
      PubMed users can also view the metastatic networks integrated from the large
      collection of research papers directly through MET. For the BioCreative 2015
      interactive track (IAT), a curation task was proposed to curate metastatic
      networks among PubMed abstracts. Six curators participated in the proposed task
      and a post-IAT task, curating 963 unique metastatic relations from 174 PubMed
      abstracts using MET.Database URL: http://btm.tmu.edu.tw/metastasisway.

TI  - Identifying a biomarker network for corticosteroid resistance in asthma from
      bronchoalveolar lavage samples.
PG  - 697-710
LID - 10.1007/s11033-016-4007-x [doi]
AB  - Corticosteroid resistance (CR) is a major barrier to the effective treatment of
      severe asthma. Hence, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved
      in this condition is a priority. Network analysis is an emerging strategy to
      explore this complex heterogeneous disorder at system level to identify a small
      own network for CR in asthma. Gene expression profile of GSE7368 from
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of CR in subjects with asthma was downloaded from
      the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database and compared to BAL of
      corticosteroid-sensitive (CS) patients. DEGs were identified by the Limma package
      in R language. In addition, DEGs were mapped to STRING to acquire protein-protein
      interaction (PPI) pairs. Topological properties of PPI network were calculated by
      Centiscape, ClusterOne and BINGO. Subsequently, text-mining tools were applied to
      design one own cell signalling for CR in asthma. Thirty-five PPI networks were
      obtained; including a major network consisted of 370 nodes, connected by 777
      edges. After topological analysis, a minor PPI network composed by 48 nodes was
      indentified, which is composed by most relevant nodes of major PPI network. In
      this subnetwork, several receptors (EGFR, EGR1, ESR2, PGR), transcription factors
      (MYC, JAK), cytokines (IL8, IL6, IL1B), one chemokine (CXCL1), one kinase (SRC)
      and one cyclooxygenase (PTGS2) were described to be associated with inflammatory 
      environment and steroid resistance in asthma. We suggest a biomarker network
      composed by 48 nodes that could be potentially explored with diagnostic or
      therapeutic use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) in
      treating coronary heart disease (CHD) by integrating gene interaction network and
      functional enrichment analysis. METHODS: Text mining was used to get CHD and PNS 
      associated genes. Gene-gene interaction networks of CHD and PNS were built by the
      GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin. Advanced Network Merge Cytoscape plugin was used to
      analyze the two networks. Their functions were analyzed by gene functional
      enrichment analysis via DAVID Bioinformatics. Joint subnetwork of CHD network and
      PNS network was identifified by network analysis. RESULTS: The 11 genes of the
      joint subnetwork were the direct targets of PNS in CHD network and enriched in
      cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. PNS could affect other 85 genes
      by the gene-gene interaction of joint subnetwork and these genes were enriched in
      other 7 pathways. The direct mechanisms of PNS in treating CHD by targeting
      cytokines to relieve the inflflammation and the indirect mechanisms of PNS in
      treating CHD by affecting other 7 pathways through the interaction of joint
      subnetwork of PNS and CHD network. The genes in the 7 pathways could be potential
      targets for the immunologic adjuvant, anticoagulant, hypolipidemic, anti-platelet
      and anti-hypertrophic activities of PNS. CONCLUSIONS: The key mechanisms of PNS
      in treating CHD could be anticoagulant and hypolipidemic which are indicated by
      analyzing biological functions of hubs in the merged network.

TI  - Prioritizing Chemicals for Risk Assessment Using Chemoinformatics: Examples from 
      the IARC Monographs on Pesticides.
PG  - 1823-1829
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying cancer hazards is the first step towards cancer
      prevention. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs
      Programme, which has evaluated nearly 1,000 agents for their carcinogenic
      potential since 1971, typically selects agents for hazard identification on the
      basis of public nominations, expert advice, published data on carcinogenicity,
      and public health importance. OBJECTIVES: Here, we present a novel and
      complementary strategy for identifying agents for hazard evaluation using
      chemoinformatics, database integration, and automated text mining. DISCUSSION: To
      inform selection among a broad range of pesticides nominated for evaluation, we
      identified and screened nearly 6,000 relevant chemical structures, after which we
      systematically compiled information on 980 pesticides, creating network maps that
      allowed cluster visualization by chemical similarity, pesticide class, and
      publicly available information concerning cancer epidemiology, cancer bioassays, 
      and carcinogenic mechanisms. For the IARC Monograph meetings that took place in
      March and June 2015, this approach supported high-priority evaluation of
      glyphosate, malathion, parathion, tetrachlorvinphos, diazinon,
      p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), lindane, and
      2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic approach,
      accounting for chemical similarity and overlaying multiple data sources, can be
      used by risk assessors as well as by researchers to systematize, inform, and
      increase efficiency in selecting and prioritizing agents for hazard
      identification, risk assessment, regulation, or further investigation. This
      approach could be extended to an array of outcomes and agents, including
      occupational carcinogens, drugs, and foods. Citation: Guha N, Guyton KZ, Loomis

TI  - Building a glaucoma interaction network using a text mining approach.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s13040-016-0096-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The volume of biomedical literature and its underlying knowledge base
      is rapidly expanding, making it beyond the ability of a single human being to
      read through all the literature. Several automated methods have been developed to
      help make sense of this dilemma. The present study reports on the results of a
      text mining approach to extract gene interactions from the data warehouse of
      published experimental results which are then used to benchmark an interaction
      network associated with glaucoma. To the best of our knowledge, there is, as yet,
      no glaucoma interaction network derived solely from text mining approaches. The
      presence of such a network could provide a useful summative knowledge base to
      complement other forms of clinical information related to this disease. RESULTS: 
      A glaucoma corpus was constructed from PubMed Central and a text mining approach 
      was applied to extract genes and their relations from this corpus. The extracted 
      relations between genes were checked using reference interaction databases and
      classified generally as known or new relations. The extracted genes and relations
      were then used to construct a glaucoma interaction network. Analysis of the
      resulting network indicated that it bears the characteristics of a small world
      interaction network. Our analysis showed the presence of seven glaucoma linked
      genes that defined the network modularity. A web-based system for browsing and
      visualizing the extracted glaucoma related interaction networks is made available
      at http://neurogene.spd.louisville.edu/GlaucomaINViewer/Form1.aspx. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study has reported the first version of a glaucoma interaction network using
      a text mining approach. The power of such an approach is in its ability to cover 
      a wide range of glaucoma related studies published over many years. Hence, a
      bigger picture of the disease can be established. To the best of our knowledge,
      this is the first glaucoma interaction network to summarize the known literature.
      The major findings were a set of relations that could not be found in existing
      interaction databases and that were found to be new, in addition to a smaller
      subnetwork consisting of interconnected clusters of seven glaucoma genes. Future 
      improvements can be applied towards obtaining a better version of this network.

TI  - Data-based Reconstruction of Gene Regulatory Networks of Fungal Pathogens.
PG  - 570
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00570 [doi]
AB  - In the emerging field of systems biology of fungal infection, one of the central 
      roles belongs to the modeling of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Utilizing
      omics-data, GRNs can be predicted by mathematical modeling. Here, we review
      current advances of data-based reconstruction of both small-scale and large-scale
      GRNs for human pathogenic fungi. The advantage of large-scale genome-wide
      modeling is the possibility to predict central (hub) genes and thereby indicate
      potential biomarkers and drug targets. In contrast, small-scale GRN models
      provide hypotheses on the mode of gene regulatory interactions, which have to be 
      validated experimentally. Due to the lack of sufficient quantity and quality of
      both experimental data and prior knowledge about regulator-target gene relations,
      the genome-wide modeling still remains problematic for fungal pathogens. While a 
      first genome-wide GRN model has already been published for Candida albicans, the 
      feasibility of such modeling for Aspergillus fumigatus is evaluated in the
      present article. Based on this evaluation, opinions are drawn on future
      directions of GRN modeling of fungal pathogens. The crucial point of genome-wide 
      GRN modeling is the experimental evidence, both used for inferring the networks
      (omics 'first-hand' data as well as literature data used as prior knowledge) and 
      for validation and evaluation of the inferred network models.

AB  - To explore the pharmacological mechanism of glycyrrhizin with series methods of
      systems pharmacology, main diseases related to glycyrrhizin were obtained by text
      mining tool; and the target proteins of glycyrrhizin were obtained via the
      database of Polysearch and PubChem. Then, the target proteins interaction network
      of glycyrrhizin was built using the software called Cytoscape. Next, the protein 
      groups related to glycyrrhizin were analyzed by using Gene Ontology (GO) tool,
      and the action pathway of its target proteins was analyzed by using enrichment
      method. Text mining results showed that the related diseases of glycyrrhizin
      included chronic hepatitis C, chronic hepatitis, hepatitis, HIV virus, liver
      cancer and so on. Gene ontology analysis indicated that glycyrrhizin played a
      role mainly through modification of proteins and chromatin. The signaling pathway
      enrichment results showed that the main action proteins of glycyrrhizin were
      related to MAPK signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway,
      neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, cancer and apoptosis pathways. So we can
      conclude that glycyrrhizin may exert its biological functions primarily by
      regulating multiple pathways such as MAPK signaling pathway and Toll-like
      receptors signaling pathway. The pharmacological action of a drug can be rapidly 
      and comprehensively analyzed by the ways of systems pharmacology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a serious disease which affects many women and may
      lead to death. It has received considerable attention from the research
      community. Thus, biomedical researchers aim to find genetic biomarkers indicative
      of the disease. Novel biomarkers can be elucidated from the existing literature. 
      However, the vast amount of scientific publications on breast cancer make this a 
      daunting task. This paper presents a framework which investigates existing
      literature data for informative discoveries. It integrates text mining and social
      network analysis in order to identify new potential biomarkers for breast cancer.
      RESULTS: We utilized PubMed for the testing. We investigated gene-gene
      interactions, as well as novel interactions such as gene-year, gene-country, and 
      abstract-country to find out how the discoveries varied over time and how
      overlapping/diverse are the discoveries and the interest of various research
      groups in different countries. CONCLUSIONS: Interesting trends have been
      identified and discussed, e.g., different genes are highlighted in relationship
      to different countries though the various genes were found to share
      functionality. Some text analysis based results have been validated against
      results from other tools that predict gene-gene relations and gene functions.

AB  - Identifying the molecular targets for the beneficial effects of active
      small-molecule compounds simultaneously is an important and currently unmet
      challenge. In this study, we firstly proposed network analysis by integrating
      data from network pharmacology and metabolomics to identify targets of active
      components in sini decoction (SND) simultaneously against heart failure. To begin
      with, 48 potential active components in SND against heart failure were predicted 
      by serum pharmacochemistry, text mining and similarity match. Then, we employed
      network pharmacology including text mining and molecular docking to identify the 
      potential targets of these components. The key enriched processes, pathways and
      related diseases of these target proteins were analyzed by STRING database. At
      last, network analysis was conducted to identify most possible targets of
      components in SND. Among the 25 targets predicted by network analysis, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was firstly experimentally validated in
      molecular and cellular level. Results indicated that hypaconitine, mesaconitine, 
      higenamine and quercetin in SND can directly bind to TNF-alpha, reduce the
      TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity on L929 cells and exert anti-myocardial cell
      apoptosis effects. We envisage that network analysis will also be useful in
      target identification of a bioactive compound.

TI  - [Mechanism of "treating heart and brain with same methods" based on data
      science].
PG  - 4288-96
AB  - The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory of "treating heart and brain
      diseases with same methods (Nao Xin Tong Zhi: NXTZ)" has great significance to
      the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It has been proven 
      effective by a great deal of clinical researches. However, the underlying
      mechanism for this theory is still unclear. To provide insights into the
      potential mechanism of "NXTZ", this study attempts to deeply investigate the
      mechanism from two representative cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,
      coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebral apoplexy. First, various data resources
      were integrated to obtain different types of biomedical entities including drugs,
      targets, pathways and diseases. Then, three different approaches including text
      mining, biological network and enrichment analysis were utilized to recognize the
      potential common features between CHD and cerebral apoplexy, and the
      corresponding functions of drugs which could treat both diseases, thus unveiling 
      the mechanism of NXTZ.

TI  - Metabolomic network analysis of estrogen-stimulated MCF-7 cells: a comparison of 
      overrepresentation analysis, quantitative enrichment analysis and pathway
      analysis versus metabolite network analysis.
PG  - 217-230
LID - 10.1007/s00204-016-1695-x [doi]
AB  - In the context of the Human Toxome project, mass spectroscopy-based metabolomics 
      characterization of estrogen-stimulated MCF-7 cells was studied in order to
      support the untargeted deduction of pathways of toxicity. A targeted and
      untargeted approach using overrepresentation analysis (ORA), quantitative
      enrichment analysis (QEA) and pathway analysis (PA) and a metabolite network
      approach were compared. Any untargeted approach necessarily has some noise in the
      data owing to artifacts, outliers and misidentified metabolites. Depending on the
      chemical analytical choices (sample extraction, chromatography, instrument and
      settings, etc.), only a partial representation of all metabolites will be
      achieved, biased by both the analytical methods and the database used to identify
      the metabolites. Here, we show on the one hand that using a data analysis
      approach based exclusively on pathway annotations has the potential to miss much 
      that is of interest and, in the case of misidentified metabolites, can produce
      perturbed pathways that are statistically significant yet uninformative for the
      biological sample at hand. On the other hand, a targeted approach, by narrowing
      its focus and minimizing (but not eliminating) misidentifications, renders the
      likelihood of a spurious pathway much smaller, but the limited number of
      metabolites also makes statistical significance harder to achieve. To avoid an
      analysis dependent on pathways, we built a de novo network using all metabolites 
      that were different at 24 h with and without estrogen with a p value <0.01 (53)
      in the STITCH database, which links metabolites based on known reactions in the
      main metabolic network pathways but also based on experimental evidence and text 
      mining. The resulting network contained a "connected component" of 43 metabolites
      and helped identify non-endogenous metabolites as well as pathways not visible by
      annotation-based approaches. Moreover, the most highly connected metabolites
      (energy metabolites such as pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate, as well as amino
      acids) showed only a modest change between proliferation with and without
      estrogen. Here, we demonstrate that estrogen has subtle but potentially
      phenotypically important alterations in the acyl-carnitine fatty acids,
      acetyl-putrescine and succinoadenosine, in addition to likely subtle changes in
      key energy metabolites that, however, could not be verified consistently given
      the technical limitations of this approach. Finally, we show that a network-based
      approach combined with text mining identifies pathways that would otherwise
      neither be considered statistically significant on their own nor be identified
      via ORA, QEA, or PA.

AB  - Text mining (TM) in the field of biology is fast becoming a routine analysis for 
      the extraction and curation of biological entities (e.g., genes, proteins, simple
      chemicals) as well as their relationships. Due to the wide applicability of TM in
      situations involving complex relationships, it is valuable to apply TM to the
      extraction of metabolic interactions (i.e., enzyme and metabolite interactions)
      through metabolic events. Here we present an integrated TM framework containing
      two modules for the extraction of metabolic events (Metabolic Event Extraction
      module-MEE) and for the construction of a metabolic interaction network
      (Metabolic Interaction Network Reconstruction module-MINR). The proposed
      integrated TM framework performed well based on standard measures of recall,
      precision and F-score. Evaluation of the MEE module using the constructed
      Metabolic Entities (ME) corpus yielded F-scores of 59.15% and 48.59% for the
      detection of metabolic events for production and consumption, respectively. As
      for the testing of the entity tagger for Gene and Protein (GP) and metabolite
      with the test corpus, the obtained F-score was greater than 80% for the
      Superpathway of leucine, valine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. Mapping of enzyme
      and metabolite interactions through network reconstruction showed a fair
      performance for the MINR module on the test corpus with F-score >70%. Finally, an
      application of our integrated TM framework on a big-scale data (i.e., EcoCyc
      extraction data) for reconstructing a metabolic interaction network showed
      reasonable precisions at 69.93%, 70.63% and 46.71% for enzyme, metabolite and
      enzyme-metabolite interaction, respectively. This study presents the first
      open-source integrated TM framework for reconstructing a metabolic interaction
      network. This framework can be a powerful tool that helps biologists to extract
      metabolic events for further reconstruction of a metabolic interaction network.
      The ME corpus, test corpus, source code, and virtual machine image with
      pre-configured software are available at www.sbi.kmutt.ac.th/ preecha/metrecon.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, referring to as the progressive loss of structure and
      function of neurons, constitute one of the major challenges of modern medicine.
      Traditional Chinese herbs have been used as a major preventive and therapeutic
      strategy against disease for thousands years. The numerous species of medicinal
      herbs and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compound formulas in nervous system 
      disease therapy make it a large chemical resource library for drug discovery. In 
      this work, we collected 7362 kinds of herbs and 58,147 Traditional Chinese
      medicinal compounds (Tcmcs). The predicted active compounds in herbs have good
      oral bioavailability and central nervous system (CNS) permeability. The molecular
      docking and network analysis were employed to analyze the effects of herbs on
      neurodegenerative diseases. In order to evaluate the predicted efficacy of herbs,
      automated text mining was utilized to exhaustively search in PubMed by some
      related keywords. After that, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves was
      used to estimate the accuracy of predictions. Our study suggested that most herbs
      were distributed in family of Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae and Apocynaceae.
      The predictive model yielded good sensitivity and specificity with the AUC values
      above 0.800. At last, 504 kinds of herbs were obtained by using the optimal
      cutoff values in ROC curves. These 504 herbs would be the most potential herb
      resources for neurodegenerative diseases treatment. This study would give us an
      opportunity to use these herbs as a chemical resource library for drug discovery 
      of anti-neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Comprehensive Map of Molecules Implicated in Obesity.

AB  - Obesity is a global epidemic affecting over 1.5 billion people and is one of the 
      risk factors for several diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      hypertension. We have constructed a comprehensive map of the molecules reported
      to be implicated in obesity. A deep curation strategy was complemented by a novel
      semi-automated text mining system in order to screen 1,000 full-length research
      articles and over 90,000 abstracts that are relevant to obesity. We obtain a
      scale free network of 804 nodes and 971 edges, composed of 510 proteins, 115
      genes, 62 complexes, 23 RNA molecules, 83 simple molecules, 3 phenotype and 3
      drugs in "bow-tie" architecture. We classify this network into 5 modules and
      identify new links between the recently discovered fat mass and obesity
      associated FTO gene with well studied examples such as insulin and leptin. We
      further built an automated docking pipeline to dock orlistat as well as other
      drugs against the 24,000 proteins in the human structural proteome to explain the
      therapeutics and side effects at a network level. Based upon our experiments, we 
      propose that therapeutic effect comes through the binding of one drug with
      several molecules in target network, and the binding propensity is both
      statistically significant and different in comparison with any other part of
      human structural proteome.

AB  - The microbiota living in the human body has critical impacts on our health and
      disease, but a systems understanding of its relationships with disease remains
      limited. Here, we use a large-scale text mining-based manually curated
      microbe-disease association data set to construct a microbe-based human disease
      network and investigate the relationships between microbes and disease genes,
      symptoms, chemical fragments and drugs. We reveal that microbe-based disease
      loops are significantly coherent. Microbe-based disease connections have strong
      overlaps with those constructed by disease genes, symptoms, chemical fragments
      and drugs. Moreover, we confirm that the microbe-based disease analysis is able
      to predict novel connections and mechanisms for disease, microbes, genes and
      drugs. The presented network, methods and findings can be a resource helpful for 
      addressing some issues in medicine, for example, the discovery of bench knowledge
      and bedside clinical solutions for disease mechanism understanding, diagnosis and
      therapy.

TI  - Prioritization of Susceptibility Genes for Ectopic Pregnancy by Gene Network
      Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17020191 [doi]
LID - E191 [pii]
AB  - Ectopic pregnancy is a very dangerous complication of pregnancy, affecting 1%-2% 
      of all reported pregnancies. Due to ethical constraints on human biopsies and the
      lack of suitable animal models, there has been little success in identifying
      functionally important genes in the pathogenesis of ectopic pregnancy. In the
      present study, we developed a random walk-based computational method named
      TM-rank to prioritize ectopic pregnancy-related genes based on text mining data
      and gene network information. Using a defined threshold value, we identified five
      top-ranked genes: VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), IL8 (interleukin 
      8), IL6 (interleukin 6), ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1) and EGFR (epidermal growth
      factor receptor). These genes are promising candidate genes that can serve as
      useful diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our approach represents a
      novel strategy for prioritizing disease susceptibility genes.

TI  - The GAAIN Entity Mapper: An Active-Learning System for Medical Data Mapping.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.3389/fninf.2015.00030 [doi]
AB  - This work is focused on mapping biomedical datasets to a common representation,
      as an integral part of data harmonization for integrated biomedical data access
      and sharing. We present GEM, an intelligent software assistant for automated data
      mapping across different datasets or from a dataset to a common data model. The
      GEM system automates data mapping by providing precise suggestions for data
      element mappings. It leverages the detailed metadata about elements in associated
      dataset documentation such as data dictionaries that are typically available with
      biomedical datasets. It employs unsupervised text mining techniques to determine 
      similarity between data elements and also employs machine-learning classifiers to
      identify element matches. It further provides an active-learning capability where
      the process of training the GEM system is optimized. Our experimental evaluations
      show that the GEM system provides highly accurate data mappings (over 90%
      accuracy) for real datasets of thousands of data elements each, in the
      Alzheimer's disease research domain. Further, the effort in training the system
      for new datasets is also optimized. We are currently employing the GEM system to 
      map Alzheimer's disease datasets from around the globe into a common
      representation, as part of a global Alzheimer's disease integrated data sharing
      and analysis network called GAAIN. GEM achieves significantly higher data mapping
      accuracy for biomedical datasets compared to other state-of-the-art tools for
      database schema matching that have similar functionality. With the use of
      active-learning capabilities, the user effort in training the system is minimal.

TI  - Literature Mining and Ontology based Analysis of Host-Brucella Gene-Gene
      Interaction Network.
PG  - 1386
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01386 [doi]
AB  - Brucella is an intracellular bacterium that causes chronic brucellosis in humans 
      and various mammals. The identification of host-Brucella interaction is crucial
      to understand host immunity against Brucella infection and Brucella pathogenesis 
      against host immune responses. Most of the information about the inter-species
      interactions between host and Brucella genes is only available in the text of the
      scientific publications. Many text-mining systems for extracting gene and protein
      interactions have been proposed. However, only a few of them have been designed
      by considering the peculiarities of host-pathogen interactions. In this paper, we
      used a text mining approach for extracting host-Brucella gene-gene interactions
      from the abstracts of articles in PubMed. The gene-gene interactions here
      represent the interactions between genes and/or gene products (e.g., proteins).
      The SciMiner tool, originally designed for detecting mammalian gene/protein names
      in text, was extended to identify host and Brucella gene/protein names in the
      abstracts. Next, sentence-level and abstract-level co-occurrence based
      approaches, as well as sentence-level machine learning based methods, originally 
      designed for extracting intra-species gene interactions, were utilized to extract
      the interactions among the identified host and Brucella genes. The extracted
      interactions were manually evaluated. A total of 46 host-Brucella gene
      interactions were identified and represented as an interaction network. Twenty
      four of these interactions were identified from sentence-level processing. Twenty
      two additional interactions were identified when abstract-level processing was
      performed. The Interaction Network Ontology (INO) was used to represent the
      identified interaction types at a hierarchical ontology structure. Ontological
      modeling of specific gene-gene interactions demonstrates that host-pathogen
      gene-gene interactions occur at experimental conditions which can be
      ontologically represented. Our results show that the introduced literature mining
      and ontology-based modeling approach are effective in retrieving and analyzing
      host-pathogen gene-gene interaction networks.

TI  - Constructing a molecular interaction network for thyroid cancer via large-scale
      text mining of gene and pathway events.
PG  - S5
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-9-S6-S5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomedical studies need assistance from automated tools and easily
      accessible data to address the problem of the rapidly accumulating literature.
      Text-mining tools and curated databases have been developed to address such needs
      and they can be applied to improve the understanding of molecular pathogenesis of
      complex diseases like thyroid cancer. RESULTS: We have developed a system,
      PWTEES, which extracts pathway interactions from the literature utilizing an
      existing event extraction tool (TEES) and pathway named entity recognition
      (PathNER). We then applied the system on a thyroid cancer corpus and
      systematically extracted molecular interactions involving either genes or
      pathways. With the extracted information, we constructed a molecular interaction 
      network taking genes and pathways as nodes. Using curated pathway information and
      network topological analyses, we highlight key genes and pathways involved in
      thyroid carcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Mining events involving genes and pathways
      from the literature and integrating curated pathway knowledge can help improve
      the understanding of molecular interactions of complex diseases. The system
      developed for this study can be applied in studies other than thyroid cancer. The

AB  - Understanding the relationships between drugs and symptoms has broad medical
      consequences, yet a comprehensive description of the drug-symptom associations is
      currently lacking. Here, 1441 FDA-approved drugs were collected, and PCA was used
      to extract 122 descriptors which explained 91% of the variance. Then, a k-means++
      method was employed to partition the drug dataset into 3 clusters, and 3
      corresponding SVDD models (drug-likeness screening models) were constructed with 
      an overall accuracy of up to 95.6%. Furthermore, 6878 herbal molecules from the
      TcmSP database were screened by the above 3 SVDD model to obtain 5309 candidate
      drug molecules with highly accept classification of 77.19%. To assess the
      accuracy of the SVDD models, 8559 herbal molecule-symptom co-occurrences were
      mined from Pubmed abstracts, involving 697 herbal molecules and 314 symptoms.
      Most of the 697 herbal molecules could be found in the accepted SVDD data (5309
      molecules), showing the potential of the SVDD for the screening of drug
      candidates. Moreover, a herbal molecule-herbal molecule network and a herbal
      molecule-symptom were constructed. Overall, the results provided a new
      drug-likeness screening approach independent to abnormal training data, and the
      comprehensive collection of herbal molecule-symptom associations formed a new
      data resource for systematic characterization of the symptom-oriented medicines.

PG  - D435-46
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkv1240 [doi]
AB  - Owing to the importance of the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of
      proteins in regulating biological processes, the dbPTM
      (http://dbPTM.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) was developed as a comprehensive database of
      experimentally verified PTMs from several databases with annotations of potential
      PTMs for all UniProtKB protein entries. For this 10th anniversary of dbPTM, the
      updated resource provides not only a comprehensive dataset of experimentally
      verified PTMs, supported by the literature, but also an integrative interface for
      accessing all available databases and tools that are associated with PTM
      analysis. As well as collecting experimental PTM data from 14 public databases,
      this update manually curates over 12 000 modified peptides, including the
      emerging S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation and succinylation, from
      approximately 500 research articles, which were retrieved by text mining. As the 
      number of available PTM prediction methods increases, this work compiles a
      non-homologous benchmark dataset to evaluate the predictive power of online PTM
      prediction tools. An increasing interest in the structural investigation of PTM
      substrate sites motivated the mapping of all experimental PTM peptides to protein
      entries of Protein Data Bank (PDB) based on database identifier and sequence
      identity, which enables users to examine spatially neighboring amino acids,
      solvent-accessible surface area and side-chain orientations for PTM substrate
      sites on tertiary structures. Since drug binding in PDB is annotated, this update
      identified over 1100 PTM sites that are associated with drug binding. The update 
      also integrates metabolic pathways and protein-protein interactions to support
      the PTM network analysis for a group of proteins. Finally, the web interface is
      redesigned and enhanced to facilitate access to this resource.

TI  - pubmed.mineR: an R package with text-mining algorithms to analyse PubMed
      abstracts.
PG  - 671-82
AB  - The PubMed literature database is a valuable source of information for scientific
      research. It is rich in biomedical literature with more than 24 million
      citations. Data-mining of voluminous literature is a challenging task. Although
      several text-mining algorithms have been developed in recent years with focus on 
      data visualization, they have limitations such as speed, are rigid and are not
      available in the open source. We have developed an R package, pubmed.mineR,
      wherein we have combined the advantages of existing algorithms, overcome their
      limitations, and offer user flexibility and link with other packages in
      Bioconductor and the Comprehensive R Network (CRAN) in order to expand the user
      capabilities for executing multifaceted approaches. Three case studies are
      presented, namely, 'Evolving role of diabetes educators', 'Cancer risk
      assessment' and 'Dynamic concepts on disease and comorbidity' to illustrate the
      use of pubmed.mineR. The package generally runs fast with small elapsed times in 
      regular workstations even on large corpus sizes and with compute intensive
      functions. The pubmed.mineR is available at http://cran.rproject.

TI  - Application of the EVEX resource to event extraction and network construction:
      Shared Task entry and result analysis.
PG  - S3
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S16-S3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern methods for mining biomolecular interactions from literature
      typically make predictions based solely on the immediate textual context, in
      effect a single sentence. No prior work has been published on extending this
      context to the information automatically gathered from the whole biomedical
      literature. Thus, our motivation for this study is to explore whether mutually
      supporting evidence, aggregated across several documents can be utilized to
      improve the performance of the state-of-the-art event extraction systems.
      RESULTS: In the GE task, our re-ranking approach led to a modest performance
      increase and resulted in the first rank of the official Shared Task results with 
      50.97% F-score. Additionally, in this paper we explore and evaluate the usage of 
      distributed vector representations for this challenge. CONCLUSIONS: For the GRN
      task, we were able to produce a gene regulatory network from the EVEX data,
      warranting the use of such generic large-scale text mining data in network
      biology settings. A detailed performance and error analysis provides more insight
      into the relatively low recall rates.

TI  - Modular organization of the human disease genes: a text-based network inference.
PG  - 432-6
LID - 10.6026/97320630011432 [doi]
AB  - The analysis of disease phenotype data with genetic information indicated that
      genes associated with clinically similar diseases tend to be functionally related
      and work together to perform a specific biological function. Therefore, it is of 
      interest to relate disease phenotype data to mirror modular property implied in
      the association map of disease genes. Hence, we constructed a textbased human
      disease gene network (HDGN) by using the phenotypic similarity of their
      associated disease phenotype records in the OMIM database. Analysis shows that
      the network is highly modular and it is highly correlated with the physiological 
      classification of genetic diseases. Using a graph clustering algorithm, we found 
      139 gene modules in the network of 1,865 genes and their gene products (proteins)
      in these gene modules tend to interact with each other via the computation of PPI
      intensity. Genes in such gene modules are functionally related and may represent 
      the shared genetic basis of their corresponding diseases. These genes, alone or
      in combination, could be considered as potential therapeutic targets in future
      clinical therapy.

TI  - METSP: a maximum-entropy classifier based text mining tool for
      transporter-substrate identification with semistructured text.
PG  - 254838
LID - 10.1155/2015/254838 [doi]
AB  - The substrates of a transporter are not only useful for inferring function of the
      transporter, but also important to discover compound-compound interaction and to 
      reconstruct metabolic pathway. Though plenty of data has been accumulated with
      the developing of new technologies such as in vitro transporter assays, the
      search for substrates of transporters is far from complete. In this article, we
      introduce METSP, a maximum-entropy classifier devoted to retrieve
      transporter-substrate pairs (TSPs) from semistructured text. Based on the high
      quality annotation from UniProt, METSP achieves high precision and recall in
      cross-validation experiments. When METSP is applied to 182,829 human transporter 
      annotation sentences in UniProt, it identifies 3942 sentences with transporter
      and compound information. Finally, 1547 confidential human TSPs are identified
      for further manual curation, among which 58.37% pairs with novel substrates not
      annotated in public transporter databases. METSP is the first efficient tool to
      extract TSPs from semistructured annotation text in UniProt. This tool can help
      to determine the precise substrates and drugs of transporters, thus facilitating 
      drug-target prediction, metabolic network reconstruction, and literature
      classification.

PG  - 15519
LID - 10.1038/srep15519 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide network analysis is well implemented to study proteins of unknown
      function. Here, we effectively explored protein functions and the biological
      mechanism based on inferred high confident protein-protein interaction (PPI)
      network in cyanobacteria. We integrated data from seven different sources and
      predicted 1,997 PPIs, which were evaluated by experiments in molecular mechanism,
      text mining of literatures in proved direct/indirect evidences, and "interologs" 
      in conservation. Combined the predicted PPIs with known PPIs, we obtained 4,715
      no-redundant PPIs (involving 3,231 proteins covering over 90% of genome) to
      generate the PPI network. Based on the PPI network, terms in Gene ontology (GO)
      were assigned to function-unknown proteins. Functional modules were identified by
      dissecting the PPI network into sub-networks and analyzing pathway enrichment,
      with which we investigated novel function of underlying proteins in protein
      complexes and pathways. Examples of photosynthesis and DNA repair indicate that
      the network approach is a powerful tool in protein function analysis. Overall,
      this systems biology approach provides a new insight into posterior functional
      analysis of PPIs in cyanobacteria.

TI  - Applying Monte Carlo Simulation to Biomedical Literature to Approximate Genetic
      Network.
PG  - 494-504
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2015.2481399 [doi]
AB  - Biologists often need to know the set of genes associated with a given set of
      genes or a given disease. We propose in this paper a classifier system called
      Monte Carlo for Genetic Network (MCforGN) that can construct genetic networks,
      identify functionally related genes, and predict gene-disease associations.
      MCforGN identifies functionally related genes based on their co-occurrences in
      the abstracts of biomedical literature. For a given gene g , the system first
      extracts the set of genes found within the abstracts of biomedical literature
      associated with g. It then ranks these genes to determine the ones with high
      co-occurrences with g . It overcomes the limitations of current approaches that
      employ analytical deterministic algorithms by applying Monte Carlo Simulation to 
      approximate genetic networks. It does so by conducting repeated random sampling
      to obtain numerical results and to optimize these results. Moreover, it analyzes 
      results to obtain the probabilities of different genes' co-occurrences using
      series of statistical tests. MCforGN can detect gene-disease associations by
      employing a combination of centrality measures (to identify the central genes in 
      disease-specific genetic networks) and Monte Carlo Simulation. MCforGN aims at
      enhancing state-of-the-art biological text mining by applying novel extraction
      techniques. We evaluated MCforGN by comparing it experimentally with nine
      approaches. Results showed marked improvement.

      data for EC were extracted from the PubMed (MEDLINE) database using text mining
      based on NLP. PPI networks and pathways were integrated and obtained from the
      KEGG and other databases. Proteins that interacted with at least 10 other
      proteins were identified as the hub proteins of the EC-related genes network.
      RESULTS: A total of 489 genes were identified as EC-related with P < 0.05, and 32
      pathways were identified as significant (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05). A network of
      EC-related proteins that included 271 interactions was constructed. The 17
      proteins that interact with 10 or more other proteins (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) were
      identified as the hub proteins of this PPI network of EC-related genes. These 17 
      proteins are EGFR, MET, PDGFRB, CCND1, JUN, FGFR2, MYC, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3R2,
      KRAS, MAPK3, CTNNB1, RELA, JAK2, AKT1, and AKT2. CONCLUSION: Our data may help to
      reveal the molecular mechanisms of EC development and provide implications for
      targeted therapy for EC. However, corrections between certain proteins and EC
      continue to require additional exploration.

TI  - Predicting CK2 beta-dependent substrates using linear patterns.
PG  - 20-27
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrep.2015.08.011 [doi]
AB  - CK2 is a constitutively active Ser/Thr protein kinase deregulated in cancer and
      other pathologies, responsible for about the 20% of the human phosphoproteome.
      The holoenzyme is a complex composed of two catalytic (alpha or alpha ) and two
      regulatory (beta) subunits, with individual subunits also coexisting in the cell.
      In the holoenzyme, CK2beta is a substrate-dependent modulator of kinase activity.
      Therefore, a comprehensive characterization of CK2 cellular function should
      firstly address which substrates are phosphorylated exclusively when CK2beta is
      present (class-III or beta-dependent substrates). However, current experimental
      constrains limit this classification to a few substrates. Here, we took advantage
      of motif-based prediction and designed four linear patterns for predicting
      class-III behavior in sets of experimentally determined CK2 substrates.
      Integrating high-throughput substrate prediction, functional classification and
      network analysis, our results suggest that beta-dependent phosphorylation might
      exert particular regulatory roles in viral infection and biological
      processes/pathways like apoptosis, DNA repair and RNA metabolism. It also
      pointed, that human beta-dependent substrates are mainly nuclear, a few of them
      shuttling between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

      conservation science.
PG  - 1606-14
LID - 10.1111/cobi.12605 [doi]
AB  - Keeping track of conceptual and methodological developments is a critical skill
      for research scientists, but this task is increasingly difficult due to the high 
      rate of academic publication. As a crisis discipline, conservation science is
      particularly in need of tools that facilitate rapid yet insightful synthesis. We 
      show how a common text-mining method (latent Dirichlet allocation, or topic
      modeling) and statistical tests familiar to ecologists (cluster analysis,
      regression, and network analysis) can be used to investigate trends and identify 
      potential research gaps in the scientific literature. We tested these methods on 
      the literature on ecological surrogates and indicators. Analysis of topic
      popularity within this corpus showed a strong emphasis on monitoring and
      management of fragmented ecosystems, while analysis of research gaps suggested a 
      greater role for genetic surrogates and indicators. Our results show that
      automated text analysis methods need to be used with care, but can provide
      information that is complementary to that given by systematic reviews and
      meta-analyses, increasing scientists' capacity for research synthesis.

TI  - Protein interaction network constructing based on text mining and reinforcement
      learning with application to prostate cancer.
PG  - 106-12
LID - 10.1049/iet-syb.2014.0050 [doi]
AB  - Constructing interaction network from biomedical texts is a very important and
      interesting work. The authors take advantage of text mining and reinforcement
      learning approaches to establish protein interaction network. Considering the
      high computational efficiency of co-occurrence-based interaction extraction
      approaches and high precision of linguistic patterns approaches, the authors
      propose an interaction extracting algorithm where they utilise frequently used
      linguistic patterns to extract the interactions from texts and then find out
      interactions from extended unprocessed texts under the basic idea of
      co-occurrence approach, meanwhile they discount the interaction extracted from
      extended texts. They put forward a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to
      establish a protein interaction network, where nodes represent proteins and edges
      denote interactions. During the evolutionary process, a node selects another node
      and the attained reward determines which predicted interaction should be
      reinforced. The topology of the network is updated by the agent until an optimal 
      network is formed. They used texts downloaded from PubMed to construct a prostate
      cancer protein interaction network by the proposed methods. The results show that
      their method brought out pretty good matching rate. Network topology analysis
      results also demonstrate that the curves of node degree distribution, node degree
      probability and probability distribution of constructed network accord with those
      of the scale-free network well.

      Text Mining Approach.
PG  - e0134585
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0134585 [doi]
AB  - Decidualization is a crucial process for successful embryo implantation and
      pregnancy in humans. Defects in decidualization during early pregnancy are
      associated with several pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia,
      intrauterine growth restriction and recurrent pregnancy loss. However, the
      mechanism underlying decidualization remains poorly understood. In the present
      study, we performed a systematic analysis of decidualization-related genes using 
      text mining. We identified 286 genes for humans and 287 genes for mice
      respectively, with an overlap of 111 genes shared by both species. Through
      enrichment test, we demonstrated that although divergence was observed, the
      majority of enriched gene ontology terms and pathways were shared by both
      species, suggesting that functional categories were more conserved than
      individual genes. We further constructed a decidualization-related
      protein-protein interaction network consisted of 344 nodes connected via 1,541
      edges. We prioritized genes in this network and identified 12 genes that may be
      key regulators of decidualization. These findings would provide some clues for
      further research on the mechanism underlying decidualization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: "Our lives are connected by a thousand invisible threads and along
      these sympathetic fibers, our actions run as causes and return to us as results".
      It is Herman Melville's famous quote describing connections among human lives. To
      paraphrase the Melville's quote, diseases are connected by many functional
      threads and along these sympathetic fibers, diseases run as causes and return as 
      results. The Melville's quote explains the reason for researching disease-disease
      similarity and disease network. Measuring similarities between diseases and
      constructing disease network can play an important role in disease function
      research and in disease treatment. To estimate disease-disease similarities, we
      proposed a novel literature-based method. METHODS AND RESULTS: The proposed
      method extracted disease-gene relations and disease-drug relations from
      literature and used the frequencies of occurrence of the relations as features to
      calculate similarities among diseases. We also constructed disease network with
      top-ranking disease pairs from our method. The proposed method discovered a
      larger number of answer disease pairs than other comparable methods and showed
      the lowest p-value. CONCLUSIONS: We presume that our method showed good results
      because of using literature data, using all possible gene symbols and drug names 
      for features of a disease, and determining feature values of diseases with the
      frequencies of co-occurrence of two entities. The disease-disease similarities
      from the proposed method can be used in computational biology researches which
      use similarities among diseases.

TI  - Development of text mining based classification of written communication within a
      telemedical collaborative network.
PG  - 35-42
AB  - Chronic diseases like Heart Failure are widespread in the ageing population.
      Affected patients can be treated with the aid of a disease management program,
      including a telemedical collaborative network. Evaluation of a currently used
      system has shown that the information of the textual communication is of pivotal 
      importance for the collaboration in the network. Thus, the challenge is to make
      this unstructured information useable, potentially leading to a better
      understanding of the collaboration so as to optimize the processes. This paper
      presents the setup of an analysis pipeline for processing textual information
      automatically, and, how this pipeline can be utilized to train a model that is
      able to automatically classify the written messages into a set of meaningful task
      and status categories.

TI  - Analysis of the human diseasome using phenotype similarity between common,
      genetic, and infectious diseases.
PG  - 10888
LID - 10.1038/srep10888 [doi]
AB  - Phenotypes are the observable characteristics of an organism arising from its
      response to the environment. Phenotypes associated with engineered and natural
      genetic variation are widely recorded using phenotype ontologies in model
      organisms, as are signs and symptoms of human Mendelian diseases in databases
      such as OMIM and Orphanet. Exploiting these resources, several computational
      methods have been developed for integration and analysis of phenotype data to
      identify the genetic etiology of diseases or suggest plausible interventions. A
      similar resource would be highly useful not only for rare and Mendelian diseases,
      but also for common, complex and infectious diseases. We apply a semantic
      text-mining approach to identify the phenotypes (signs and symptoms) associated
      with over 6,000 diseases. We evaluate our text-mined phenotypes by demonstrating 
      that they can correctly identify known disease-associated genes in mice and
      humans with high accuracy. Using a phenotypic similarity measure, we generate a
      human disease network in which diseases that have similar signs and symptoms
      cluster together, and we use this network to identify closely related diseases
      based on common etiological, anatomical as well as physiological underpinnings.

AB  - In temperate and sub-tropical regions of Asia and Latin America, complicated
      malaria manifested as hepatic dysfunction or renal dysfunction is seen in all age
      groups. There has been a concerted focus on understanding the patho-physiological
      and molecular basis of complicated malaria in children, much less is known about 
      it in adults. We report here, the analysis of data from a custom, cross strain
      microarray (Agilent Platform) using material from adult patient samples, showing 
      hepatic dysfunction or renal failure. These are the most common manifestations
      seen in adults along with cerebral malaria. The data has been analyzed with
      reference to variant surface antigens, encoded by the var, rifin and stevor gene 
      families. The differential regulation profiles of key genes (comparison between
      Plasmodium falciparum complicated and uncomplicated isolates) have been observed.
      The exportome has been analyzed using similar parameters. Gene ontology term
      based functional enrichment of differentially regulated genes identified,
      up-regulated genes statistically enriched (P<0.05) to critical biological
      processes like generation of precursor metabolite and energy, chromosome
      organization and electron transport chain. Systems network based functional
      enrichment of overall differentially regulated genes yielded a similar result. We
      are reporting here, up-regulation of var group B and C genes whose proteins are
      predicted to interact with CD36 receptor in the host, the up-regulation of domain
      cassette 13 (DC13) containing var group A, as also the up-regulation of group A
      rifins and many of the stevors. This is contrary to most other reports from
      pediatric patients, with cerebral malaria where the up-regulation of mostly var A
      group genes have been seen. A protein-protein interaction based network has been 
      created and analysis performed. This co-expression and text mining based network 
      has shown overall connectivity between the variant surface antigens (VSA) and the
      exportome. The up-regulation of var group B and C genes encoding PfEMP1 with
      different domain architecture would be important for deciding strategies for
      disease prevention.

TI  - PALM-IST: Pathway Assembly from Literature Mining--an Information Search Tool.
PG  - 10021
LID - 10.1038/srep10021 [doi]
AB  - Manual curation of biomedical literature has become extremely tedious process due
      to its exponential growth in recent years. To extract meaningful information from
      such large and unstructured text, newer and more efficient mining tool is
      required. Here, we introduce PALM-IST, a computational platform that not only
      allows users to explore biomedical abstracts using keyword based text mining but 
      also extracts biological entity (e.g., gene/protein, drug, disease, biological
      processes, cellular component, etc.) information from the extracted text and
      subsequently mines various databases to provide their comprehensive
      inter-relation (e.g., interaction, expression, etc.). PALM-IST constructs protein
      interaction network and pathway information data relevant to the text search
      using multiple data mining tools and assembles them to create a meta-interaction 
      network. It also analyzes scientific collaboration by extraction and creation of 
      "co-authorship network," for a given search context. Hence, this useful
      combination of literature and data mining provided in PALM-IST can be used to
      extract novel protein-protein interaction (PPI), to generate meta-pathways and
      further to identify key crosstalk and bottleneck proteins. PALM-IST is available 
      at www.hpppi.iicb.res.in/ctm.

TI  - Detecting unplanned care from clinician notes in electronic health records.
PG  - e313-9
LID - 10.1200/JOP.2014.002741 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Reduction in unplanned episodes of care, such as emergency department
      visits and unplanned hospitalizations, are important quality outcome measures.
      However, many events are only documented in free-text clinician notes and are
      labor intensive to detect by manual medical record review. METHODS: We studied
      308,096 free-text machine-readable documents linked to individual entries in our 
      electronic health records, representing care for patients with breast, GI, or
      thoracic cancer, whose treatment was initiated at one academic medical center,
      Stanford Health Care (SHC). Using a clinical text-mining tool, we detected
      unplanned episodes documented in clinician notes (for non-SHC visits) or in coded
      encounter data for SHC-delivered care and the most frequent symptoms documented
      in emergency department (ED) notes. RESULTS: Combined reporting increased the
      identification of patients with one or more unplanned care visits by 32% (15%
      using coded data; 20% using all the data) among patients with 3 months of
      follow-up and by 21% (23% using coded data; 28% using all the data) among those
      with 1 year of follow-up. Based on the textual analysis of SHC ED notes, pain
      (75%), followed by nausea (54%), vomiting (47%), infection (36%), fever (28%),
      and anemia (27%), were the most frequent symptoms mentioned. Pain, nausea, and
      vomiting co-occur in 35% of all ED encounter notes. CONCLUSION: The text-mining
      methods we describe can be applied to automatically review free-text clinician
      notes to detect unplanned episodes of care mentioned in these notes. These
      methods have broad application for quality improvement efforts in which events of
      interest occur outside of a network that allows for patient data sharing.

      a bioinformatics approach.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126283 [doi]
AB  - By regulating the timing of cellular processes, the circadian clock provides a
      way to adapt physiology and behaviour to the geophysical time. In mammals, a
      light-entrainable master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
      controls peripheral clocks that are present in virtually every body cell.
      Defective circadian timing is associated with several pathologies such as cancer 
      and metabolic and sleep disorders. To better understand the circadian regulation 
      of cellular processes, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline encompassing the
      analysis of high-throughput data sets and the exploitation of published knowledge
      by text-mining. We identified 118 novel potential clock-regulated genes and
      integrated them into an existing high-quality circadian network, generating the
      to-date most comprehensive network of circadian regulated genes (NCRG). To
      validate particular elements in our network, we assessed publicly available
      ChIP-seq data for BMAL1, REV-ERBalpha/beta and RORalpha/gamma proteins and found 
      strong evidence for circadian regulation of Elavl1, Nme1, Dhx6, Med1 and Rbbp7
      all of which are involved in the regulation of tumourigenesis. Furthermore, we
      identified Ncl and Ddx6, as targets of RORgamma and REV-ERBalpha, beta,
      respectively. Most interestingly, these genes were also reported to be involved
      in miRNA regulation; in particular, NCL regulates several miRNAs, all involved in
      cancer aggressiveness. Thus, NCL represents a novel potential link via which the 
      circadian clock, and specifically RORgamma, regulates the expression of miRNAs,
      with particular consequences in breast cancer progression. Our findings bring us 
      one step forward towards a mechanistic understanding of mammalian circadian
      regulation, and provide further evidence of the influence of circadian
      deregulation in cancer.

PG  - 235
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2015.00235 [doi]
AB  - Pathogens manipulate the cellular mechanisms of host organisms via pathogen-host 
      interactions (PHIs) in order to take advantage of the capabilities of host cells,
      leading to infections. The crucial role of these interspecies molecular
      interactions in initiating and sustaining infections necessitates a thorough
      understanding of the corresponding mechanisms. Unlike the traditional approach of
      considering the host or pathogen separately, a systems-level approach,
      considering the PHI system as a whole is indispensable to elucidate the
      mechanisms of infection. Following the technological advances in the post-genomic
      era, PHI data have been produced in large-scale within the last decade. Systems
      biology-based methods for the inference and analysis of PHI regulatory,
      metabolic, and protein-protein networks to shed light on infection mechanisms are
      gaining increasing demand thanks to the availability of omics data. The knowledge
      derived from the PHIs may largely contribute to the identification of new and
      more efficient therapeutics to prevent or cure infections. There are recent
      efforts for the detailed documentation of these experimentally verified PHI data 
      through Web-based databases. Despite these advances in data archiving, there are 
      still large amounts of PHI data in the biomedical literature yet to be
      discovered, and novel text mining methods are in development to unearth such
      hidden data. Here, we review a collection of recent studies on computational
      systems biology of PHIs with a special focus on the methods for the inference and
      analysis of PHI networks, covering also the Web-based databases and text-mining
      efforts to unravel the data hidden in the literature.

LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-9-S2-S2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sufficient knowledge of molecular and genetic interactions, which
      comprise the entire basis of the functioning of living systems, is one of the
      necessary requirements for successfully answering almost any research question in
      the field of biology and medicine. To date, more than 24 million scientific
      papers can be found in PubMed, with many of them containing descriptions of a
      wide range of biological processes. The analysis of such tremendous amounts of
      data requires the use of automated text-mining approaches. Although a handful of 
      tools have recently been developed to meet this need, none of them provide
      error-free extraction of highly detailed information. RESULTS: The ANDSystem
      package was developed for the reconstruction and analysis of molecular genetic
      networks based on an automated text-mining technique. It provides a detailed
      description of the various types of interactions between genes, proteins,
      microRNA's, metabolites, cellular components, pathways and diseases, taking into 
      account the specificity of cell lines and organisms. Although the accuracy of
      ANDSystem is comparable to other well known text-mining tools, such as Pathway
      Studio and STRING, it outperforms them in having the ability to identify an
      increased number of interaction types. CONCLUSION: The use of ANDSystem, in
      combination with Pathway Studio and STRING, can improve the quality of the
      automated reconstruction of molecular and genetic networks. ANDSystem should
      provide a useful tool for researchers working in a number of different fields,
      including biology, biotechnology, pharmacology and medicine.

TI  - Molecular association of pathogenetic contributors to pre-eclampsia
      (pre-eclampsia associome).
PG  - S4
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-9-S2-S4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is the most common complication occurring during
      pregnancy. In the majority of cases, it is concurrent with other pathologies in a
      comorbid manner (frequent co-occurrences in patients), such as diabetes mellitus,
      gestational diabetes and obesity. Providing bronchial asthma, pulmonary
      tuberculosis, certain neurodegenerative diseases and cancers as examples, we have
      shown previously that pairs of inversely comorbid pathologies (rare
      co-occurrences in patients) are more closely related to each other at the
      molecular genetic level compared with randomly generated pairs of diseases. Data 
      in the literature concerning the causes of pre-eclampsia are abundant. However,
      the key mechanisms triggering this disease that are initiated by other
      pathological processes are thus far unknown. The aim of this work was to analyse 
      the characteristic features of genetic networks that describe interactions
      between comorbid diseases, using pre-eclampsia as a case in point. RESULTS: The
      use of ANDSystem, Pathway Studio and STRING computer tools based on text-mining
      and database-mining approaches allowed us to reconstruct associative networks,
      representing molecular genetic interactions between genes, associated
      concurrently with comorbid disease pairs, including pre-eclampsia, diabetes
      mellitus, gestational diabetes and obesity. It was found that these associative
      networks statistically differed in the number of genes and interactions between
      them from those built for randomly chosen pairs of diseases. The associative
      network connecting all four diseases was composed of 16 genes (PLAT, ADIPOQ,
      ADRB3, LEPR, HP, TGFB1, TNFA, INS, CRP, CSRP1, IGFBP1, MBL2, ACE, ESR1, SHBG,
      ADA). Such an analysis allowed us to reveal differential gene risk factors for
      these diseases, and to propose certain, most probable, theoretical mechanisms of 
      pre-eclampsia development in pregnant women. The mechanisms may include the
      following pathways: [TGFB1 or TNFA]-[IL1B]-[pre-eclampsia]; [TNFA or
      INS]-[NOS3]-[pre-eclampsia]; [INS]-[HSPA4 or CLU]-[pre-eclampsia];
      [ACE]-[MTHFR]-[pre-eclampsia]. CONCLUSIONS: For pre-eclampsia, diabetes mellitus,
      gestational diabetes and obesity, we showed that the size and connectivity of the
      associative molecular genetic networks, which describe interactions between
      comorbid diseases, statistically exceeded the size and connectivity of those
      built for randomly chosen pairs of diseases. Recently, we have shown a similar
      result for inversely comorbid diseases. This suggests that comorbid and inversely
      comorbid diseases have common features concerning structural organization of
      associative molecular genetic networks.

AB  - Protein-Protein Interaction extraction (PPIe) from biomedical literatures is an
      important task in biomedical text mining and has achieved desirable results on
      the annotated datasets. However, the traditional machine learning methods on PPIe
      suffer badly from vocabulary gap and data sparseness, which weakens
      classification performance. In this work, an approach capturing external
      information from the web-based data is introduced to address these problems and
      boost the existing methods. The approach involves three kinds of word
      representation techniques: distributed representation, vector clustering and

TI  - MPTP's pathway of toxicity indicates central role of transcription factor SP1.
PG  - 743-55
LID - 10.1007/s00204-015-1509-6 [doi]
AB  - Deriving a Pathway of Toxicity from transcriptomic data remains a challenging
      task. We explore the use of weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to
      extract an initial network from a small microarray study of MPTP toxicity in
      mice. Five modules were statistically significant; each module was analyzed for
      gene signatures in the Chemical and Genetic Perturbation subset of the Molecular 
      Signatures Database as well as for over-represented transcription factor binding 
      sites and WGCNA clustered probes by function and captured pathways relevant to
      neurodegenerative disorders. The resulting network was analyzed for transcription
      factor candidates, which were narrowed down via text-mining for relevance to the 
      disease model, and then combined with the large-scale interaction FANTOM4
      database to generate a genetic regulatory network. Modules were enriched for
      transcription factors relevant to Parkinson's disease. Transcription factors
      significantly improved the number of genes that could be connected in a given
      component. For each module, the transcription factor that had, by far, the
      highest number of interactions was SP1, and it also had substantial experimental 
      evidence of interactions. This analysis both captures much of the known biology
      of MPTP toxicity and suggests several candidates for further study. Furthermore, 
      the analysis strongly suggests that SP1 plays a central role in coordinating the 
      cellular response to MPTP toxicity.

TI  - Construction of phosphorylation interaction networks by text mining of
      full-length articles using the eFIP system.
LID - 10.1093/database/bav020 [doi]
LID - bav020 [pii]
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification where a
      protein kinase adds a phosphate group to a protein, potentially regulating its
      function, localization and/or activity. Phosphorylation can affect
      protein-protein interactions (PPIs), abolishing interaction with previous binding
      partners or enabling new interactions. Extracting phosphorylation information
      coupled with PPI information from the scientific literature will facilitate the
      creation of phosphorylation interaction networks of kinases, substrates and
      interacting partners, toward knowledge discovery of functional outcomes of
      protein phosphorylation. Increasingly, PPI databases are interested in capturing 
      the phosphorylation state of interacting partners. We have previously developed
      the eFIP (Extracting Functional Impact of Phosphorylation) text mining system,
      which identifies phosphorylated proteins and phosphorylation-dependent PPIs. In
      this work, we present several enhancements for the eFIP system: (i) text mining
      for full-length articles from the PubMed Central open-access collection; (ii) the
      integration of the RLIMS-P 2.0 system for the extraction of phosphorylation
      events with kinase, substrate and site information; (iii) the extension of the
      PPI module with new trigger words/phrases describing interactions and (iv) the
      addition of the iSimp tool for sentence simplification to aid in the matching of 
      syntactic patterns. We enhance the website functionality to: (i) support searches
      based on protein roles (kinases, substrates, interacting partners) or using
      keywords; (ii) link protein entities to their corresponding UniProt identifiers
      if mapped and (iii) support visual exploration of phosphorylation interaction
      networks using Cytoscape. The evaluation of eFIP on full-length articles achieved
      92.4% precision, 76.5% recall and 83.7% F-measure on 100 article sections. To
      demonstrate eFIP for knowledge extraction and discovery, we constructed
      phosphorylation-dependent interaction networks involving 14-3-3 proteins
      identified from cancer-related versus diabetes-related articles. Comparison of
      the phosphorylation interaction network of kinases, phosphoproteins and
      interactants obtained from eFIP searches, along with enrichment analysis of the
      protein set, revealed several shared interactions, highlighting common pathways
      discussed in the context of both diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To synthesise recent research on the use of machine learning
      approaches to mining textual injury surveillance data. DESIGN: Systematic review.
      DATA SOURCES: The electronic databases which were searched included PubMed,
      Cinahl, Medline, Google Scholar, and Proquest. The bibliography of all relevant
      articles was examined and associated articles were identified using a snowballing
      technique. SELECTION CRITERIA: For inclusion, articles were required to meet the 
      following criteria: (a) used a health-related database, (b) focused on
      injury-related cases, AND used machine learning approaches to analyse textual
      data. METHODS: The papers identified through the search were screened resulting
      in 16 papers selected for review. Articles were reviewed to describe the
      databases and methodology used, the strength and limitations of different
      techniques, and quality assurance approaches used. Due to heterogeneity between
      studies meta-analysis was not performed. RESULTS: Occupational injuries were the 
      focus of half of the machine learning studies and the most common methods
      described were Bayesian probability or Bayesian network based methods to either
      predict injury categories or extract common injury scenarios. Models were
      evaluated through either comparison with gold standard data or content expert
      evaluation or statistical measures of quality. Machine learning was found to
      provide high precision and accuracy when predicting a small number of categories,
      was valuable for visualisation of injury patterns and prediction of future
      outcomes. However, difficulties related to generalizability, source data quality,
      complexity of models and integration of content and technical knowledge were
      discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of narrative text for injury surveillance has
      grown in popularity, complexity and quality over recent years. With advances in
      data mining techniques, increased capacity for analysis of large databases, and
      involvement of computer scientists in the injury prevention field, along with
      more comprehensive use and description of quality assurance methods in text
      mining approaches, it is likely that we will see a continued growth and
      advancement in knowledge of text mining in the injury field.

AB  - The knowledge on protein-protein interactions (PPI) and their related pathways
      are equally important to understand the biological functions of the living cell. 
      Such information on human proteins is highly desirable to understand the
      mechanism of several diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. 
      Because much of that information is buried in biomedical literature, an automated
      text mining system for visualizing human PPI and pathways is highly desirable. In
      this paper, we present HPIminer, a text mining system for visualizing human
      protein interactions and pathways from biomedical literature. HPIminer extracts
      human PPI information and PPI pairs from biomedical literature, and visualize
      their associated interactions, networks and pathways using two curated databases 
      HPRD and KEGG. To our knowledge, HPIminer is the first system to build
      interaction networks from literature as well as curated databases. Further, the
      new interactions mined only from literature and not reported earlier in databases
      are highlighted as new. A comparative study with other similar tools shows that
      the resultant network is more informative and provides additional information on 
      interacting proteins and their associated networks.

AB  - Since the genome project in 1990s, a number of studies associated with genes have
      been conducted and researchers have confirmed that genes are involved in disease.
      For this reason, the identification of the relationships between diseases and
      genes is important in biology. We propose a method called LGscore, which
      identifies disease-related genes using Google data and literature data. To
      implement this method, first, we construct a disease-related gene network using
      text-mining results. We then extract gene-gene interactions based on
      co-occurrences in abstract data obtained from PubMed, and calculate the weights
      of edges in the gene network by means of Z-scoring. The weights contain two
      values: the frequency and the Google search results. The frequency value is
      extracted from literature data, and the Google search result is obtained using
      Google. We assign a score to each gene through a network analysis. We assume that
      genes with a large number of links and numerous Google search results and
      frequency values are more likely to be involved in disease. For validation, we
      investigated the top 20 inferred genes for five different diseases using answer
      sets. The answer sets comprised six databases that contain information on
      disease-gene relationships. We identified a significant number of disease-related
      genes as well as candidate genes for Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, colon cancer,
      lung cancer, and prostate cancer. Our method was up to 40% more accurate than
      existing methods.

PG  - 1918-28
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2392786 [doi]
AB  - One of the key goals of biological natural language processing (NLP) is the
      automatic information extraction from biomedical publications. Most current
      constituency and dependency parsers overlook the semantic relationships between
      the constituents comprising a sentence and may not be well suited for capturing
      complex long-distance dependences. We propose in this paper a hybrid
      constituency-dependency parser for biological NLP information extraction called
      EDCC. EDCC aims at enhancing the state of the art of biological text mining by
      applying novel linguistic computational techniques that overcome the limitations 
      of current constituency and dependency parsers outlined earlier, as follows: 1)
      it determines the semantic relationship between each pair of constituents in a
      sentence using novel semantic rules; and 2) it applies a semantic relationship
      extraction model that extracts information from different structural forms of
      constituents in sentences. EDCC can be used to extract different types of data
      from biological texts for purposes such as protein function prediction, genetic
      network construction, and protein-protein interaction detection. We evaluated the
      quality of EDCC by comparing it experimentally with six systems. Results showed
      marked improvement.

TI  - Construction and analysis of a protein-protein interaction network related to
      self-renewal of mouse spermatogonial stem cells.
PG  - 835-43
LID - 10.1039/c4mb00579a [doi]
AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are responsible for sustained spermatogenesis
      throughout the reproductive life of the male. Extensive studies of SSCs have
      identified dozens of genes that play important roles in sustaining or controlling
      the pool of SSCs in the mammalian testis. However, there is still limited
      knowledge of whether or how these key genes interact with each other during SSC
      self-renewal. Here, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
      for SSC self-renewal based on interactions between 23 genes essential for SSC
      self-renewal, which were obtained from a text mining system, and the interacting 
      partners of the 23 key genes, which were differentially expressed in SSCs. The
      SSC self-renewal PPI network consisted of 246 nodes connected by 844 edges.
      Topological analyses of the PPI network were conducted to identify genes
      essential for maintenance of SSC self-renewal. The subnetwork of the SSC
      self-renewal network suggested that the 23 key genes involved in SSC self-renewal
      were connected together through other 94 genes. Clustering of the whole network
      and subnetwork of SSC self-renewal revealed several densely connected regions,
      implying significant molecular interaction modules essential for SSC
      self-renewal. Notably, we found the 23 genes to be responsible for SSC
      self-renewal by forming a continuous PPI network centered on Pou5f1. Our study
      indicates that it is feasible to explore important proteins and regulatory
      pathways in biological activities by combining a PPI database with the
      high-throughput data of gene expression profiles.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore mechanisms by which fructus
      Schisandrae chinensis (Wuweizi) is able to reveal its protective capacity against
      hepatocyte injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identification of candidate small
      molecular compounds was performed by text-mining, extraction and isolation,
      reverse-docking, network construction, molecular docking and molecular dynamics
      (MD) simulation. In vitro cytological examination and western blotting were used 
      to validate efficacy of selected compounds. RESULTS: We analyzed chemical
      composition of fructus Schisandrae chinensis and constructed protein-protein
      networks of key targets. Networks of miRNA-protein were constructed. Molecular
      docking and MD simulation results supported good interaction between selected
      compound 11/12 and GBA3/SHBG. Further in vitro examination divulged molecular
      mechanisms involved. CONCLUSIONS: In silico analysis and experimental validation 
      together demonstrated that compound 11/12 of fructus Schisandrae chinensis
      targetted GBA3/SHBG in hepatocytes. Hopefully this will shed light on exploration
      of its complex molecular mechanisms.

TI  - The COPD Knowledge Base: enabling data analysis and computational simulation in
      translational COPD research.
PG  - S6
LID - 10.1186/1479-5876-12-S2-S6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously we generated a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) specific knowledge base (http://www.copdknowledgebase.eu) from clinical
      and experimental data, text-mining results and public databases. This knowledge
      base allowed the retrieval of specific molecular networks together with
      integrated clinical and experimental data. RESULTS: The COPDKB has now been
      extended to integrate over 40 public data sources on functional interaction (e.g.
      signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, protein-protein interaction,
      gene-disease association). In addition we integrated COPD-specific expression and
      co-morbidity networks connecting over 6 000 genes/proteins with physiological
      parameters and disease states. Three mathematical models describing different
      aspects of systemic effects of COPD were connected to clinical and experimental
      data. We have completely redesigned the technical architecture of the user
      interface and now provide html and web browser-based access and form-based
      searches. A network search enables the use of interconnecting information and the
      generation of disease-specific sub-networks from general knowledge. Integration
      with the Synergy-COPD Simulation Environment enables multi-scale integrated
      simulation of individual computational models while integration with a Clinical
      Decision Support System allows delivery into clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      COPD Knowledge Base is the only publicly available knowledge resource dedicated
      to COPD and combining genetic information with molecular, physiological and
      clinical data as well as mathematical modelling. Its integrated analysis
      functions provide overviews about clinical trends and connections while its
      semantically mapped content enables complex analysis approaches. We plan to
      further extend the COPDKB by offering it as a repository to publish and
      semantically integrate data from relevant clinical trials. The COPDKB is freely
      available after registration at http://www.copdknowledgebase.eu.

TI  - Network analyses of sperm-egg recognition and binding: ready to rethink fertility
      mechanisms?
PG  - 740-53
LID - 10.1089/omi.2014.0128 [doi]
AB  - The rapid growth of published literature makes biomedical text mining
      increasingly invaluable for unpacking implicit knowledge hidden in unstructured
      text. We employed biomedical text mining and biological networks analyses to
      research the process of sperm egg recognition and binding (SERB). We selected
      from the literature the molecules expressed either on spermatozoa or on oocytes
      thought to be involved in SERB and, using an automated literature search software
      (Agilent Literature Search), we realized a network, SERBN, characterized by a
      hierarchical scale free and a small world topology. We used an integrated
      approach, either based on selection of hubs or by a cluster analysis, to discern 
      the key molecules of SERB. We found that in most cases some of them are not
      directly situated on spermatozoa and oocyte, but are dispersed in oviductal fluid
      or embedded in exosomes present in the perivitelline space. To confirm and
      validate our results, we performed further analyses using STRING and Reactome FI 
      software. Our findings underscore that the fertility is not a property of gametes
      in isolation, but rather depends on the functional integrity of the entire
      reproductive system. These observations collectively underscore the importance of
      integrative biology in exploring biological systems and in rethinking of
      fertility mechanisms in the light of this innovative approach.

TI  - Computer-assisted curation of a human regulatory core network from the biological
      literature.
PG  - 1258-66
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu795 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: A highly interlinked network of transcription factors (TFs)
      orchestrates the context-dependent expression of human genes. ChIP-chip
      experiments that interrogate the binding of particular TFs to genomic regions are
      used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks at genome-scale, but are plagued by 
      high false-positive rates. Meanwhile, a large body of knowledge on high-quality
      regulatory interactions remains largely unexplored, as it is available only in
      natural language descriptions scattered over millions of scientific publications.
      Such data are hard to extract and regulatory data currently contain together only
      503 regulatory relations between human TFs. RESULTS: We developed a
      text-mining-assisted workflow to systematically extract knowledge about
      regulatory interactions between human TFs from the biological literature. We
      applied this workflow to the entire Medline, which helped us to identify more
      than 45 000 sentences potentially describing such relationships. We ranked these 
      sentences by a machine-learning approach. The top-2500 sentences contained
      approximately 900 sentences that encompass relations already known in databases. 
      By manually curating the remaining 1625 top-ranking sentences, we obtained more
      than 300 validated regulatory relationships that were not present in a regulatory
      database before. Full-text curation allowed us to obtain detailed information on 
      the strength of experimental evidences supporting a relationship. CONCLUSIONS: We
      were able to increase curated information about the human core transcriptional
      network by >60% compared with the current content of regulatory databases. We
      observed improved performance when using the network for disease gene
      prioritization compared with the state-of-the-art. AVAILABILITY AND

AB  - Angiogenesis is the process of generating new blood vessels based on existing
      ones, which is involved in many diseases including cancers, cardiovascular
      diseases and diabetes mellitus. Recently, great efforts have been made to explore
      the mechanisms of angiogenesis in various diseases and many angiogenic factors
      have been discovered as therapeutic targets in anti- or pro-angiogenic drug
      development. However, the resulted information is sparsely distributed and no
      systematical summarization has been made. In order to integrate these related
      results and facilitate the researches for the community, we conducted manual
      text-mining from published literature and built a database named as PubAngioGen
      (http://www.megabionet.org/aspd/). Our online application displays a
      comprehensive network for exploring the connection between angiogenesis and
      diseases at multilevels including protein-protein interaction, drug-target,
      disease-gene and signaling pathways among various cells and animal models
      recorded through text-mining. To enlarge the scope of the PubAngioGen
      application, our database also links to other common resources including STRING, 
      DrugBank and OMIM databases, which will facilitate understanding the underlying
      molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis and drug development in clinical therapy.

TI  - Gene and Protein Network Analysis of AmpC beta Lactamase.
PG  - 1553-67
LID - 10.1007/s12013-014-0379-5 [doi]
AB  - AmpC beta-lactamase is a cephalosporinase, which exhibits resistance against all 
      existing beta-lactam antibiotics except carbapenems. Their occurrence in many
      bacterial pathogens poses a threat to public health and is a growing concern in
      the medical world. The ampC gene is highly inducible in the presence of
      beta-lactam antibiotics and can be expressed in high levels due to mutation. This
      inducible expression is regulated by several functional genes. Several studies on
      functional relationship of these genes and its resistance mechanisms are carried 
      out but it still lacks comprehensible evidences. Thus, in our current study, we
      used computational gene networks to analyze ampC gene. Based on its interaction
      type, co-expression, Gene Ontology, and text mining, a functional interaction
      network is constructed. Around 247 functional genes in 15 different bacterial
      genus have a functional association with ampC gene. It is predicted that 19.8%
      ampD, 13.3% frdD, 8.5% gcvA, 2.4% ampR, and 55.7% of other functional partners
      are associated with ampC gene. Our present study provides a glimpse about the
      functional gene network of ampC gene and also provides the integrated evidence
      for ampC gene in regulating the beta-lactamase production and its role in
      antibiotic resistance.

TI  - Semi-automated literature mining to identify putative biomarkers of disease from 
      multiple biofluids.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/2043-9113-4-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computational methods for mining of biomedical literature can be
      useful in augmenting manual searches of the literature using keywords for
      disease-specific biomarker discovery from biofluids. In this work, we develop and
      apply a semi-automated literature mining method to mine abstracts obtained from
      PubMed to discover putative biomarkers of breast and lung cancers in specific
      biofluids. METHODOLOGY: A positive set of abstracts was defined by the terms
      'breast cancer' and 'lung cancer' in conjunction with 14 separate 'biofluids'
      (bile, blood, breastmilk, cerebrospinal fluid, mucus, plasma, saliva, semen,
      serum, synovial fluid, stool, sweat, tears, and urine), while a negative set of
      abstracts was defined by the terms '(biofluid) NOT breast cancer' or '(biofluid) 
      NOT lung cancer.' More than 5.3 million total abstracts were obtained from PubMed
      and examined for biomarker-disease-biofluid associations (34,296 positive and
      2,653,396 negative for breast cancer; 28,355 positive and 2,595,034 negative for 
      lung cancer). Biological entities such as genes and proteins were tagged using
      ABNER, and processed using Python scripts to produce a list of putative
      biomarkers. Z-scores were calculated, ranked, and used to determine significance 
      of putative biomarkers found. Manual verification of relevant abstracts was
      performed to assess our method's performance. RESULTS: Biofluid-specific markers 
      were identified from the literature, assigned relevance scores based on frequency
      of occurrence, and validated using known biomarker lists and/or databases for
      lung and breast cancer [NCBI's On-line Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM),
      Cancer Gene annotation server for cancer genomics (CAGE), NCBI's Genes & Disease,
      NCI's Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), and others]. The specificity of
      each marker for a given biofluid was calculated, and the performance of our
      semi-automated literature mining method assessed for breast and lung cancer.
      CONCLUSIONS: We developed a semi-automated process for determining a list of
      putative biomarkers for breast and lung cancer. New knowledge is presented in the
      form of biomarker lists; ranked, newly discovered biomarker-disease-biofluid
      relationships; and biomarker specificity across biofluids.

TI  - A gene network bioinformatics analysis for pemphigoid autoimmune blistering
      diseases.
PG  - 1207-22
LID - 10.1007/s00784-014-1349-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this theoretical study, a text mining search and clustering
      analysis of data related to genes potentially involved in human pemphigoid
      autoimmune blistering diseases (PAIBD) was performed using web tools to create a 
      gene/protein interaction network. METHODS: The Search Tool for the Retrieval of
      Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database was employed to identify a final set
      of PAIBD-involved genes and to calculate the overall significant interactions
      among genes: for each gene, the weighted number of links, or WNL, was registered 
      and a clustering procedure was performed using the WNL analysis. Genes were
      ranked in class (leader, B, C, D and so on, up to orphans). An ontological
      analysis was performed for the set of 'leader' genes. RESULTS: Using the
      above-mentioned data network, 115 genes represented the final set; leader genes
      numbered 7 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interferon gamma (IFNG), 
      interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)), class B
      genes were 13, whereas the orphans were 24. The ontological analysis attested
      that the molecular action was focused on extracellular space and cell surface,
      whereas the activation and regulation of the immunity system was widely involved.
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited knowledge of the present pathologic phenomenon, 
      attested by the presence of 24 genes revealing no protein-protein direct or
      indirect interactions, the network showed significant pathways gathered in
      several subgroups: cellular components, molecular functions, biological processes
      and the pathologic phenomenon obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) database. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The molecular basis for PAIBD was
      summarised and expanded, which will perhaps give researchers promising directions
      for the identification of new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Identifying similar diseases could potentially provide deeper understanding of
      their underlying causes, and may even hint at possible treatments. For this
      purpose, it is necessary to have a similarity measure that reflects the
      underpinning molecular interactions and biological pathways. We have thus devised
      a network-based measure that can partially fulfill this goal. Our method assigns 
      weights to all proteins (and consequently their encoding genes) by using
      information flow from a disease to the protein interaction network and back.
      Similarity between two diseases is then defined as the cosine of the angle
      between their corresponding weight vectors. The proposed method also provides a
      way to suggest disease-pathway associations by using the weights assigned to the 
      genes to perform enrichment analysis for each disease. By calculating pairwise
      similarities between 2534 diseases, we show that our disease similarity measure
      is strongly correlated with the probability of finding the diseases in the same
      disease family and, more importantly, sharing biological pathways. We have also
      compared our results to those of MimMiner, a text-mining method that assigns
      pairwise similarity scores to diseases. We find the results of the two methods to
      be complementary. It is also shown that clustering diseases based on their
      similarities and performing enrichment analysis for the cluster centers
      significantly increases the term association rate, suggesting that the cluster
      centers are better representatives for biological pathways than the diseases
      themselves. This lends support to the view that our similarity measure is a good 
      indicator of relatedness of biological processes involved in causing the
      diseases. Although not needed for understanding this paper, the raw results are
      available for download for further study at

PG  - e108624
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0108624 [doi]
AB  - Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed numerous Crohn's
      disease susceptibility genes and a key challenge now is in understanding how risk
      polymorphisms in associated genes might contribute to development of this
      disease. For a gene to contribute to disease phenotype, its risk variant will
      likely adversely communicate with a variety of other gene products to result in
      dysregulation of common signaling pathways. A vital challenge is to elucidate
      pathways of potentially greatest influence on pathological behaviour, in a manner
      recognizing how multiple relevant genes may yield integrative effect. In this
      work we apply mathematical analysis of networks involving the list of recently
      described Crohn's susceptibility genes, to prioritise pathways in relation to
      their potential development of this disease. Prioritisation was performed by
      applying a text mining and a diffusion based method (GRAIL, GPEC). Prospective
      biological significance of the resulting prioritised list of proteins is
      highlighted by changes in their gene expression levels in Crohn's patients
      intestinal tissue in comparison with healthy donors.

TI  - A random set scoring model for prioritization of disease candidate genes using
      protein complexes and data-mining of GeneRIF, OMIM and PubMed records.
PG  - 315
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-15-315 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prioritizing genetic variants is a challenge because disease
      susceptibility loci are often located in genes of unknown function or the
      relationship with the corresponding phenotype is unclear. A global data-mining
      exercise on the biomedical literature can establish the phenotypic profile of
      genes with respect to their connection to disease phenotypes. The importance of
      protein-protein interaction networks in the genetic heterogeneity of common
      diseases or complex traits is becoming increasingly recognized. Thus, the
      development of a network-based approach combined with phenotypic profiling would 
      be useful for disease gene prioritization. RESULTS: We developed a random-set
      scoring model and implemented it to quantify phenotype relevance in a
      network-based disease gene-prioritization approach. We validated our approach
      based on different gene phenotypic profiles, which were generated from PubMed
      abstracts, OMIM, and GeneRIF records. We also investigated the validity of
      several vocabulary filters and different likelihood thresholds for predicted
      protein-protein interactions in terms of their effect on the network-based
      gene-prioritization approach, which relies on text-mining of the phenotype data. 
      Our method demonstrated good precision and sensitivity compared with those of two
      alternative complex-based prioritization approaches. We then conducted a global
      ranking of all human genes according to their relevance to a range of human
      diseases. The resulting accurate ranking of known causal genes supported the
      reliability of our approach. Moreover, these data suggest many promising novel
      candidate genes for human disorders that have a complex mode of inheritance.
      CONCLUSION: We have implemented and validated a network-based approach to
      prioritize genes for human diseases based on their phenotypic profile. We have
      devised a powerful and transparent tool to identify and rank candidate genes. Our
      global gene prioritization provides a unique resource for the biological
      interpretation of data from genome-wide association studies, and will help in the
      understanding of how the associated genetic variants influence disease or
      quantitative phenotypes.

LID - 10.3389/fphys.2014.00332 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: New pharmacovigilance methods are needed as a consequence of the
      morbidity caused by drugs. We exploit fine-grained drug related adverse event
      information extracted by text mining from electronic medical records (EMRs) to
      stratify patients based on their adverse events and to determine adverse event
      co-occurrences. METHODS: We analyzed the similarity of adverse event profiles of 
      2347 patients extracted from EMRs from a mental health center in Denmark. The
      patients were clustered based on their adverse event profiles and the
      similarities were presented as a network. The set of adverse events in each main 
      patient cluster was evaluated. Co-occurrences of adverse events in patients
      (p-value < 0.01) were identified and presented as well. RESULTS: We found that
      each cluster of patients typically had a most distinguishing adverse event.
      Examination of the co-occurrences of adverse events in patients led to the
      identification of potentially interesting adverse event correlations that may be 
      further investigated as well as provide further patient stratification
      opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the feasibility of a novel
      approach in pharmacovigilance to stratify patients based on fine-grained adverse 
      event profiles, which also makes it possible to identify adverse event
      correlations. Used on larger data sets, this data-driven method has the potential
      to reveal unknown patterns concerning adverse event occurrences.

LID - 10.1155/2014/484926 [doi]
AB  - Liuwei-dihuang (LWDH) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), but
      its molecular mechanism about gene interactions is unclear. LWDH genes were
      extracted from the existing literatures based on text mining technology. To
      simulate the complex molecular interactions that occur in the whole body,
      protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) were constructed and the topological
      properties of LWDH genes were analyzed. LWDH genes have higher centrality
      properties and may play important roles in the complex biological network
      environment. It was also found that the distances within LWDH genes are smaller
      than expected, which means that the communication of LWDH genes during the
      biological process is rapid and effectual. At last, a comprehensive network of
      LWDH genes, including the related drugs and regulatory pathways at both the
      transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, was constructed and analyzed. The
      biological network analysis strategy used in this study may be helpful for the
      understanding of molecular mechanism of TCM.

AB  - Lung cancer including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung
      cancer is one of the most aggressive tumors with high incidence and low survival 
      rate. The typical NSCLC patients account for 80-85 % of the total lung cancer
      patients. To systemically explore the molecular mechanisms of NSCLC, we performed
      a molecular network analysis between human and mouse to identify key genes
      (pathways) involved in the occurrence of NSCLC. We automatically extracted the
      human-to-mouse orthologous interactions using the GeneWays system by natural
      language processing and further constructed molecular (gene and its products)
      networks by mapping the human-to-mouse interactions to NSCLC-related mammalian
      phenotypes, followed by module analysis using ClusterONE of Cytoscape and pathway
      enrichment analysis using the database for annotation, visualization and
      integrated discovery (DAVID) successively. A total of 70 genes were proven to be 
      related to the mammalian phenotypes of NSCLC, and seven genes (ATAD5, BECN1,
      CDKN2A, FNTB, E2F1, KRAS and PTEN) were found to have a bearing on more than one 
      mammalian phenotype (MP) each. Four network clusters centered by four genes
      thyroglobulin (TG), neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1 ), neurofibromatosis type 2
      (NF2 ) and E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) were generated. Genes in the four
      network modules were enriched in eight KEGG pathways (p value < 0.05), including 
      pathways in cancer, small cell lung cancer, cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway.
      Genes p53 and E2F1 may play important roles in NSCLC occurrence, and thus can be 
      considered as therapeutic targets for NSCLC.

      through an in silico approach.

AB  - There is a controversial relationship between HLA-A2 and Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). It has been suggested a modifier effect on the risk that depends on genetic
      loadings. Thus, the aims of this study were to evaluate this relationship and to 
      reveal genes associated with both concepts the HLA-A gene and AD. Consequently,
      we did first a classical systematic review and a meta-analysis of case-control
      studies. Next, by means of an in silico approach, we used experimental knowledge 
      of protein-protein interactions to evaluate the top ranked genes shared by both
      concepts, previously found through text mining. The meta-analysis did not show a 
      significant pooled OR (1.11, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.24 in Caucasians), in spite of the
      fact that four of the included studies had a significant OR > 1 and none of them 
      a significant OR < 1. In contrast, the in silico approach retrieved nonrandomly
      shared genes by both concepts (P = 0.02), which additionally encode truly
      interacting proteins. The network of proteins encoded by APP, ICAM-1, ITGB2,
      ITGAL, SELP, SELL, IL2, IL1B, CD4, and CD8A linked immune to neurodegenerative
      processes and highlighted the potential roles in AD pathogenesis of endothelial
      regulation, infectious diseases, specific antigen presentation, and HLA-A2 in
      maintaining synapses.

TI  - Identifying Similar Cases in Document Networks Using Cross-Reference Structures.
PG  - 1906-17
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2014.2345873 [doi]
AB  - Our objective was to explore the creation of document networks based on different
      thresholds of shared information and different clustering algorithms on those
      networks to identify document clusters describing similar clinical cases. We
      created networks from vaccine adverse event report sets using seven approaches
      for linking reports. We then applied three clustering algorithms [visualization
      of similarities (VOS), Louvain, k-means] to these networks and evaluated their
      ability to identify known clusters. The report sets included one simulated set
      and three sets from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System; each was split
      into training and testing subsets. Training subsets were used to estimate
      parameter values for the clustering algorithms and testing subsets to evaluate
      clusters. We created the networks by linking reports based on shared information 
      in the form either of individual Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
      Preferred Terms (PTs) or of dyads, triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, and
      sextuplets of PTs; we created another network by weighting the single PT network 
      connections by Lin's information theoretic approach to similarity. We then
      repeated this entire process using networks based on text mining output rather
      than structured data. We evaluated report clustering using recall, precision, and
      f-measure. The VOS algorithm outperformed Louvain and k-means in general. The
      best weighting scheme appeared to be related to the complexity of the known
      cluster. For example, singleton weighting performed best for an intussusception
      cluster driven by a single PT. We observed marginal differences between the code-
      and textual-based clustering. In conclusion, our approach supported
      identification of similar nodes in a document network.

TI  - SKIMMR: facilitating knowledge discovery in life sciences by machine-aided skim
      reading.
PG  - e483
LID - 10.7717/peerj.483 [doi]
AB  - Background. Unlike full reading, 'skim-reading' involves the process of looking
      quickly over information in an attempt to cover more material whilst still being 
      able to retain a superficial view of the underlying content. Within this work, we
      specifically emulate this natural human activity by providing a dynamic
      graph-based view of entities automatically extracted from text. For the
      extraction, we use shallow parsing, co-occurrence analysis and semantic
      similarity computation techniques. Our main motivation is to assist biomedical
      researchers and clinicians in coping with increasingly large amounts of
      potentially relevant articles that are being published ongoingly in life
      sciences. Methods. To construct the high-level network overview of articles, we
      extract weighted binary statements from the text. We consider two types of these 
      statements, co-occurrence and similarity, both organised in the same
      distributional representation (i.e., in a vector-space model). For the
      co-occurrence weights, we use point-wise mutual information that indicates the
      degree of non-random association between two co-occurring entities. For computing
      the similarity statement weights, we use cosine distance based on the relevant
      co-occurrence vectors. These statements are used to build fuzzy indices of terms,
      statements and provenance article identifiers, which support fuzzy querying and
      subsequent result ranking. These indexing and querying processes are then used to
      construct a graph-based interface for searching and browsing entity networks
      extracted from articles, as well as articles relevant to the networks being
      browsed. Last but not least, we describe a methodology for automated experimental
      evaluation of the presented approach. The method uses formal comparison of the
      graphs generated by our tool to relevant gold standards based on manually curated
      PubMed, TREC challenge and MeSH data. Results. We provide a web-based prototype
      (called 'SKIMMR') that generates a network of inter-related entities from a set
      of documents which a user may explore through our interface. When a particular
      area of the entity network looks interesting to a user, the tool displays the
      documents that are the most relevant to those entities of interest currently
      shown in the network. We present this as a methodology for browsing a collection 
      of research articles. To illustrate the practical applicability of SKIMMR, we
      present examples of its use in the domains of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and
      Parkinson's Disease. Finally, we report on the results of experimental evaluation
      using the two domains and one additional dataset based on the TREC challenge. The
      results show how the presented method for machine-aided skim reading outperforms 
      tools like PubMed regarding focused browsing and informativeness of the browsing 
      context.

TI  - Potential therapeutic targets for oral cancer: ADM, TP53, EGFR, LYN, CTLA4, SKIL,
      CTGF, CD70.
PG  - e102610
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0102610 [doi]
AB  - In India, oral cancer has consistently ranked among top three causes of
      cancer-related deaths, and it has emerged as a top cause for the cancer-related
      deaths among men. Lack of effective therapeutic options is one of the main
      challenges in clinical management of oral cancer patients. We interrogated large 
      pool of samples from oral cancer gene expression studies to identify potential
      therapeutic targets that are involved in multiple cancer hallmark events.
      Therapeutic strategies directed towards such targets can be expected to
      effectively control cancer cells. Datasets from different gene expression studies
      were integrated by removing batch-effects and was used for downstream analyses,
      including differential expression analysis. Dependency network analysis was done 
      to identify genes that undergo marked topological changes in oral cancer samples 
      when compared with control samples. Causal reasoning analysis was carried out to 
      identify significant hypotheses, which can explain gene expression profiles
      observed in oral cancer samples. Text-mining based approach was used to detect
      cancer hallmarks associated with genes significantly expressed in oral cancer. In
      all, 2365 genes were detected to be differentially expressed genes, which
      includes some of the highly differentially expressed genes like matrix
      metalloproteinases (MMP-1/3/10/13), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands (IL8,
      CXCL-10/-11), PTHLH, SERPINE1, NELL2, S100A7A, MAL, CRNN, TGM3, CLCA4, keratins
      (KRT-3/4/13/76/78), SERPINB11 and serine peptidase inhibitors (SPINK-5/7). XIST, 
      TCEAL2, NRAS and FGFR2 are some of the important genes detected by dependency and
      causal network analysis. Literature mining analysis annotated 1014 genes, out of 
      which 841 genes were statistically significantly annotated. The integration of
      output of various analyses, resulted in the list of potential therapeutic targets
      for oral cancer, which included targets such as ADM, TP53, EGFR, LYN, CTLA4,
      SKIL, CTGF and CD70.

TI  - Inhibition of activated Ras suppresses multiple oncogenic Hub genes in human
      epithelial tumors.
PG  - 1609-17
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2014.2532 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells may involve diverse mutations, but they often rely on continued
      expression of a single oncoprotein for survival, as a response to targeting this 
      protein. Generally, Ras is overexpressed in human epithelial tumors and
      cancellation of activated Ras inhibits carcinoma cell proliferation and
      differentiation ability, and induces apoptotosis of tumor cells. However, the
      mechanisms of inhibition of activated Ras that suppress the malignancy activity
      of human epithelial tumors remain to be illuminated. We utilized text-mining of
      MEDLINE abstracts with natural language processing to establish the Ras biologic 
      association network, and identified several interactions of this network with the
      Ras pathway. Our investigation not only examined the expression of Ras and Hub
      genes (PIK3CA, MDM2, CCND1, EGFR, JUN, MYC, VEGFA, ERK1 and ERK2) but also
      confirmed inhibition of activated Ras reduced expression of multiple oncogene in 
      vitro studies. Our studies provide strong support for the conclusion that
      cancellation of activated Ras specifically regulates defective Ras pathways in
      human tumor cells.

AB  - Understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with disease is a central goal 
      of modern medical research. As such, many thousands of experiments have been
      published that detail individual molecular events that contribute to a disease.
      Here we use a semi-automated text mining approach to accurately and exhaustively 
      curate the primary literature for chronic pain states. In so doing, we create a
      comprehensive network of 1,002 contextualized protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
      specifically associated with pain. The PPIs form a highly interconnected and
      coherent structure, and the resulting network provides an alternative to those
      derived from connecting genes associated with pain using interactions that have
      not been shown to occur in a painful state. We exploit the contextual data
      associated with our interactions to analyse subnetworks specific to inflammatory 
      and neuropathic pain, and to various anatomical regions. Here, we identify
      potential targets for further study and several drug-repurposing opportunities.
      Finally, the network provides a framework for the interpretation of new data
      within the field of pain.

AB  - This research maps the knowledge translation process for two different types of
      nanotechnologies applied to cancer: liposomes and metallic nanostructures (MNs). 
      We performed a structural analysis of citation networks and text mining supported
      in controlled vocabularies. In the case of liposomes, our results identify
      subnetworks (invisible colleges) associated with different therapeutic
      strategies: nanopharmacology, hyperthermia, and gene therapy. Only in the
      pharmacological strategy was an organized knowledge translation process
      identified, which, however, is monopolized by the liposomal doxorubicins. In the 
      case of MNs, subnetworks are not differentiated by the type of therapeutic
      strategy, and the content of the documents is still basic research. Research on
      MNs is highly focused on developing a combination of molecular imaging and
      photothermal therapy.

LID - bau049 [pii]
AB  - Given the current explosion of data within original publications generated in the
      field of genomics, a recognized bottleneck is the transfer of such knowledge into
      comprehensive databases. We have for years organized knowledge on transcriptional
      regulation reported in the original literature of Escherichia coli K-12 into
      RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx), our database that is currently
      supported by >5000 papers. Here, we report a first step towards the automatic
      biocuration of growth conditions in this corpus. Using the OntoGene text-mining
      system (http://www.ontogene.org), we extracted and manually validated regulatory 
      interactions and growth conditions in a new approach based on filters that enable
      the curator to select informative sentences from preprocessed full papers. Based 
      on a set of 48 papers dealing with oxidative stress by OxyR, we were able to
      retrieve 100% of the OxyR regulatory interactions present in RegulonDB, including
      the transcription factors and their effect on target genes. Our strategy was
      designed to extract, as we did, their growth conditions. This result provides a
      proof of concept for a more direct and efficient curation process, and enables us
      to define the strategy of the subsequent steps to be implemented for a
      semi-automatic curation of original literature dealing with regulation of gene
      expression in bacteria. This project will enhance the efficiency and quality of
      the curation of knowledge present in the literature of gene regulation, and
      contribute to a significant increase in the encoding of the regulatory network of
      E. coli. RegulonDB Database URL: http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx OntoGene URL:

AB  - Associating microRNAs (miRNAs) with cancers is an important step of understanding
      the mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis and finding novel biomarkers for cancer
      therapies. In this study, we constructed a miRNA-cancer association network
      (miCancerna) based on more than 1,000 miRNA-cancer associations detected from
      millions of abstracts with the text-mining method, including 226 miRNA families
      and 20 common cancers. We further prioritized cancer-related miRNAs at the
      network level with the random-walk algorithm, achieving a relatively higher
      performance than previous miRNA disease networks. Finally, we examined the top 5 
      candidate miRNAs for each kind of cancer and found that 71% of them are confirmed
      experimentally. miCancerna would be an alternative resource for the
      cancer-related miRNA identification.

AB  - The study of biological networks is playing an increasingly important role in the
      life sciences. Many different kinds of biological system can be modelled as
      networks; perhaps the most important examples are protein-protein interaction
      (PPI) networks, metabolic pathways, gene regulatory networks, and signalling
      networks. Although much useful information is easily accessible in publicly
      databases, a lot of extra relevant data lies scattered in numerous published
      papers. Hence there is a pressing need for automated text-mining methods capable 
      of extracting such information from full-text articles. Here we present practical
      guidelines for constructing a text-mining pipeline from existing code and
      software components capable of extracting PPI networks from full-text articles.
      This approach can be adapted to tackle other types of biological network.

TI  - Dissecting active ingredients of Chinese medicine by content-weighted
      ingredient-target network.
PG  - 1905-11
LID - 10.1039/c3mb70581a [doi]
AB  - Chinese medicine has been widely used in clinical practice, but its mode of
      action often remains obscure. This has seriously hindered further development and
      better clinical applications of Chinese medicine. Among the most critical
      questions to be addressed, the identification of active ingredients is an
      important one requiring more research. Existing methods are only concerned the
      potential pharmacological effects of the individual purified chemical ingredients
      without consideration of the contents of these ingredients, which is critical to 
      the comprehensive effect of Chinese medicine. A novel approach was proposed here 
      to integrate network pharmacology analysis and ingredient content in Chinese
      medicine to identify active ingredients. The therapeutic action of Xuesaitong
      (XST) injection on myocardial infarction was analyzed as an example in this
      study. Firstly, we built a cardiovascular disease (CVD) related protein-protein
      interaction (PPI) network. Secondly, the potential targets of the ingredients of 
      XST were identified by integrating microarray data, text mining and pharmacophore
      model-based prediction. The target-ingredient relationships were then mapped to
      the network. Topological attributes related to the targets of these ingredients, 
      together with the ingredients' contents, were combined to calculate a
      composition-weighted index for integrative evaluation of ingredient efficacy. Our
      results indicated that major active ingredients in XST were notoginsenoside R1,
      ginsenoside Rg1, Rb1, Rd and Re, which was further validated on myocardial
      infarction rat models. In conclusion, this study presented a novel approach to
      identify active ingredients in Chinese medicine.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is a uniformly lethal disease that can be difficult to diagnose
      at its early stage. Thus, our present study aimed to explore the underlying
      mechanism and identify new targets for this disease. The data GSE16515, including
      36 tumor and 16 normal samples were available from Gene Expression Omnibus.
      Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out using Robust Multichip
      Averaging and LIMMA package. Moreover, gene ontology and pathway enrichment
      analyses were performed to DEGs. Followed with protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      network construction by STRING and Cytoscape, module analysis was conducted using
      ClusterONE. Finally, based on PubMed, text mining about these DEGs was carried
      out. Total 274 up-regulated and 93 down-regulated genes were identified as the
      common DEGs and these genes were discovered significantly enriched in cell
      adhesion and extracellular region terms, as well as ECM-receptor interaction
      pathway. In addition, five modules were screened out from the up-regulated PPI
      network with none in down-regulated network. Finally, the up-regulated genes,
      including MIA, MET and CEACAMS, and down-regulated genes, such as FGF, INS and
      LAPP, had the most references in text mining analysis. Our findings demonstrate
      that the up- and down-regulated genes play important roles in pancreatic cancer
      development and might be new targets for the therapy.

      Chinese-language nursing recording system.
PG  - 223-31
LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000051 [doi]
AB  - In 2009, the Department of Health, part of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced the
      advent of electronic medical records to reduce medical expenses and facilitate
      the international exchange of medical record information. An information
      technology platform for nursing records in medical institutions was then quickly 
      established, which improved nursing information systems and electronic databases.
      The purpose of the present study was to explore the usability of the data mining 
      techniques to enhance completeness and ensure consistency of nursing records in
      the database system.First, the study used a Chinese word-segmenting system on
      common and special terms often used by the nursing staff. We also used
      text-mining techniques to collect keywords and create a keyword lexicon. We then 
      used an association rule and artificial neural network to measure the correlation
      and forecasting capability for keywords. Finally, nursing staff members were
      provided with an on-screen pop-up menu to use when establishing nursing records. 
      Our study found that by using mining techniques we were able to create a powerful
      keyword lexicon and establish a forecasting model for nursing diagnoses, ensuring
      the consistency of nursing terminology and improving the nursing staff's work
      efficiency and productivity.

TI  - Biblio-MetReS for user-friendly mining of genes and biological processes in
      scientific documents.
PG  - e276
LID - 10.7717/peerj.276 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: One way to initiate the reconstruction of molecular circuits is by
      using automated text-mining techniques. Developing more efficient methods for
      such reconstruction is a topic of active research, and those methods are
      typically included by bioinformaticians in pipelines used to mine and curate
      large literature datasets. Nevertheless, experimental biologists have a limited
      number of available user-friendly tools that use text-mining for network
      reconstruction and require no programming skills to use. One of these tools is
      Biblio-MetReS. Originally, this tool permitted an on-the-fly analysis of
      documents contained in a number of web-based literature databases to identify
      co-occurrence of proteins/genes. This approach ensured results that were always
      up-to-date with the latest live version of the databases. However, this
      'up-to-dateness' came at the cost of large execution times. Here we report an
      evolution of the application Biblio-MetReS that permits constructing
      co-occurrence networks for genes, GO processes, Pathways, or any combination of
      the three types of entities and graphically represent those entities. We show
      that the performance of Biblio-MetReS in identifying gene co-occurrence is as
      least as good as that of other comparable applications (STRING and iHOP). In
      addition, we also show that the identification of GO processes is on par to that 
      reported in the latest BioCreAtIvE challenge. Finally, we also report the
      implementation of a new strategy that combines on-the-fly analysis of new
      documents with preprocessed information from documents that were encountered in
      previous analyses. This combination simultaneously decreases program run time and
      maintains 'up-to-dateness' of the results. AVAILABILITY:

TI  - Computational disease gene prioritization: an appraisal.
PG  - 456-65
LID - 10.1089/cmb.2013.0158 [doi]
AB  - Bioinformatics aids in the understanding of the biological processes of living
      beings and the genetic architecture of human diseases. The discovery of
      disease-related genes improves the diagnosis and therapy design for the disease. 
      To save the cost and time involved in the experimental verification of the
      candidate genes, computational methods are employed for ranking the genes
      according to their likelihood of being associated with the disease. Only
      top-ranked genes are then verified experimentally. A variety of methods have been
      conceived by the researchers for the prioritization of the disease candidate
      genes, which differ in the data source being used or the scoring function used
      for ranking the genes. A review of various aspects of computational disease gene 
      prioritization and its research issues is presented in this article. The aspects 
      covered are gene prioritization process, data sources used, types of
      prioritization methods, and performance assessment methods. This article provides
      a brief overview and acts as a quick guide for disease gene prioritization.

PG  - 515-27
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2013-04-RA-0028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishing a Case Definition (CDef) is a first step in many
      epidemiological, clinical, surveillance, and research activities. The application
      of CDefs still relies on manual steps and this is a major source of inefficiency 
      in surveillance and research. OBJECTIVE: Describe the need and propose an
      approach for automating the useful representation of CDefs for medical
      conditions. METHODS: We translated the existing Brighton Collaboration CDef for
      anaphylaxis by mostly relying on the identification of synonyms for the criteria 
      of the CDef using the NLM MetaMap tool. We also generated a CDef for the same
      condition using all the related PubMed abstracts, processing them with a text
      mining tool, and further treating the synonyms with the above strategy. The
      co-occurrence of the anaphylaxis and any other medical term within the same
      sentence of the abstracts supported the construction of a large semantic network.
      The 'islands' algorithm reduced the network and revealed its densest region
      including the nodes that were used to represent the key criteria of the CDef. We 
      evaluated the ability of the "translated" and the "generated" CDef to classify a 
      set of 6034 H1N1 reports for anaphylaxis using two similarity approaches and
      comparing them with our previous semi-automated classification approach. RESULTS:
      Overall classification performance across approaches to producing CDefs was
      similar, with the generated CDef and vector space model with cosine similarity
      having the highest accuracy (0.825 +/- 0.003) and the semi-automated approach and
      vector space model with cosine similarity having the highest recall (0.809 +/-
      0.042). Precision was low for all approaches. CONCLUSION: The useful
      representation of CDefs is a complicated task but potentially offers substantial 
      gains in efficiency to support safety and clinical surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of high-throughput genomic technologies
      and the accumulation of genome-wide datasets for gene expression profiling and
      biological networks, the impact of diseases and drugs on gene expression can be
      comprehensively characterized. Drug repositioning offers the possibility of
      reduced risks in the drug discovery process, thus it is an essential step in drug
      development. RESULTS: Computational prediction of drug-disease interactions using
      gene expression profiling datasets and biological networks is a new direction in 
      drug repositioning that has gained increasing interest. We developed a
      computational framework to build disease-drug networks using drug- and
      disease-specific subnetworks. The framework incorporates protein networks to
      refine drug and disease associated genes and prioritize genes in disease and drug
      specific networks. For each drug and disease we built multiple networks using
      gene expression profiling and text mining. Finally a logistic regression model
      was used to build functional associations between drugs and diseases.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found that representing drugs and diseases by genes with high
      centrality degree in gene networks is the most promising representation of drug
      or disease subnetworks.

LID - 10.1093/jncimonographs/lgt025 [doi]
AB  - Online cancer communities help members support one another, provide new
      perspectives about living with cancer, normalize experiences, and reduce
      isolation. The American Cancer Society's 166000-member Cancer Survivors Network
      (CSN) is the largest online peer support community for cancer patients,
      survivors, and caregivers. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were applied to 
      CSN breast and colorectal cancer discussion posts from 2005 to 2010 to examine
      how sentiment change of thread initiators, a measure of social support, varies by
      discussion topic. The support provided in CSN is highest for medical, lifestyle, 
      and treatment issues. Threads related to 1) treatments and side effects, surgery,
      mastectomy and reconstruction, and decision making for breast cancer, 2) lung
      scans, and 3) treatment drugs in colon cancer initiate with high negative
      sentiment and produce high average sentiment change. Using text mining tools to
      assess sentiment, sentiment change, and thread topics provides new insights that 
      community managers can use to facilitate member interactions and enhance support 
      outcomes.

AB  - As the number of prescribed drugs is constantly rising, drug-drug interactions
      are an important issue. The simultaneous administration of several drugs can
      cause severe adverse effects based on interactions with the same metabolizing
      enzyme(s). The Transformer database
      (http://bioinformatics.charite.de/transformer) contains integrated information on
      the three phases of biotransformation (modification, conjugation and excretion)
      of 3000 drugs and >350 relevant food ingredients (e.g. grapefruit juice) and
      herbs, which are catalyzed by 400 proteins. A total of 100,000 interactions were 
      found through text mining and manual validation. The 3D structures of 200
      relevant proteins are included. The database enables users to search for drugs
      with a visual display of known interactions with phase I (Cytochrome P450) and
      phase II enzymes, transporters, food and herbs. For each interaction, PubMed
      references are given. To detect mutual impairments of drugs, the drug-cocktail
      tool displays interactions between selected drugs. By choosing the indication for
      a drug, the tool offers suggestions for alternative medications to avoid
      metabolic conflicts. Drug interactions can also be visualized in an interactive
      network view. Additionally, prodrugs, including their mechanisms of activation,
      and further information on enzymes of biotransformation, including 3D models, can
      be viewed.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review algorithms used to identify uveitis in administrative and
      claims databases. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE database via PubMed from 1991 
      to September 2012 using vocabulary and key terms related to uveitis. We also
      searched the reference lists of included studies. Two investigators independently
      assessed studies against pre-determined inclusion criteria. The same two
      investigators independently extracted data regarding participant and algorithm
      characteristics and assessed a study's methodological rigor using a pre-defined
      approach. RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Variability exists among
      algorithms employed in these studies for finding cases of uveitis and related
      conditions as well as in use and implementation of validation methods. Of the
      seven included studies, three involved case validation. One used a narrow
      algorithm in addition to text mining of electronic medical records to identify
      incident cases and found a positive predictive value of 52.1%. The other two,
      which used broader uveitis definitions and included both incident and prevalent
      cases, found positive predictive values of 24.8% and 52.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Further 
      research, with case as well as individual code validation, is needed to determine
      appropriate uveitis algorithms for purposes of active surveillance in
      administrative data. Decisions about which algorithm to use will depend on the
      desired balance of sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - A Framework of Knowledge Integration and Discovery for Supporting
      Pharmacogenomics Target Predication of Adverse Drug Events: A Case Study of
      Drug-Induced Long QT Syndrome.
PG  - 88-92
AB  - Knowledge-driven text mining is becoming an important research area for
      identifying pharmacogenomics target genes. However, few of such studies have been
      focused on the pharmacogenomics targets of adverse drug events (ADEs). The
      objective of the present study is to build a framework of knowledge integration
      and discovery that aims to support pharmacogenomics target predication of ADEs.
      We integrate a semantically annotated literature corpus Semantic MEDLINE with a
      semantically coded ADE knowledgebase known as ADEpedia using a semantic web based
      framework. We developed a knowledge discovery approach combining a network
      analysis of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and a gene functional
      classification approach. We performed a case study of drug-induced long QT
      syndrome for demonstrating the usefulness of the framework in predicting
      potential pharmacogenomics targets of ADEs.

TI  - STITCH 4: integration of protein-chemical interactions with user data.
PG  - D401-7
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkt1207 [doi]
AB  - STITCH is a database of protein-chemical interactions that integrates many
      sources of experimental and manually curated evidence with text-mining
      information and interaction predictions. Available at http://stitch.embl.de, the 
      resulting interaction network includes 390 000 chemicals and 3.6 million proteins
      from 1133 organisms. Compared with the previous version, the number of
      high-confidence protein-chemical interactions in human has increased by 45%, to
      367 000. In this version, we added features for users to upload their own data to
      STITCH in the form of internal identifiers, chemical structures or quantitative
      data. For example, a user can now upload a spreadsheet with screening hits to
      easily check which interactions are already known. To increase the coverage of
      STITCH, we expanded the text mining to include full-text articles and added a
      prediction method based on chemical structures. We further changed our scheme for
      transferring interactions between species to rely on orthology rather than
      protein similarity. This improves the performance within protein families, where 
      scores are now transferred only to orthologous proteins, but not to paralogous
      proteins. STITCH can be accessed with a web-interface, an API and downloadable
      files.

AB  - Gene regulation research concerns the regulatory relationship between
      transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes (TGenes). Due to the rapid
      acceleration of biological research, it is impractical for biologists to read all
      of the relevant literature and manually extract all of the information about the 
      regulatory relationships between a TF and its TGenes. This paper proposes a
      method utilizing negative and positive textual patterns to extract regulatory
      information regarding certain TF-TGene pairs, which provides insightful
      information to biologists and saves them time from excessive literature reading. 
      We hypothesized that the negative patterns could be used for filtering and that
      the system would mainly rely on the positive patterns to mine the regulatory
      TF-TGene relationships from the text. We also examined whether WordNet could be
      utilized to improve the pattern recognition performance. The results show that
      the negative pattern should be used for initial filtering, and then the positive 
      patterns can extract information related to gene regulation. Moreover, WordNet
      seems to have little effect on the performance when extracting gene regulations.

TI  - Generic information can retrieve known biological associations: implications for 
      biomedical knowledge discovery.
PG  - e78665
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0078665 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Weighted semantic networks built from text-mined literature can be
      used to retrieve known protein-protein or gene-disease associations, and have
      been shown to anticipate associations years before they are explicitly stated in 
      the literature. Our text-mining system recognizes over 640,000 biomedical
      concepts: some are specific (i.e., names of genes or proteins) others generic
      (e.g., 'Homo sapiens'). Generic concepts may play important roles in automated
      information retrieval, extraction, and inference but may also result in concept
      overload and confound retrieval and reasoning with low-relevance or even spurious
      links. Here, we attempted to optimize the retrieval performance for
      protein-protein interactions (PPI) by filtering generic concepts (node filtering)
      or links to generic concepts (edge filtering) from a weighted semantic network.
      First, we defined metrics based on network properties that quantify the
      specificity of concepts. Then using these metrics, we systematically filtered
      generic information from the network while monitoring retrieval performance of
      known protein-protein interactions. We also systematically filtered specific
      information from the network (inverse filtering), and assessed the retrieval
      performance of networks composed of generic information alone. RESULTS: Filtering
      generic or specific information induced a two-phase response in retrieval
      performance: initially the effects of filtering were minimal but beyond a
      critical threshold network performance suddenly drops. Contrary to expectations, 
      networks composed exclusively of generic information demonstrated retrieval
      performance comparable to unfiltered networks that also contain specific
      concepts. Furthermore, an analysis using individual generic concepts demonstrated
      that they can effectively support the retrieval of known protein-protein
      interactions. For instance the concept "binding" is indicative for PPI retrieval 
      and the concept "mutation abnormality" is indicative for gene-disease
      associations. CONCLUSION: Generic concepts are important for information
      retrieval and cannot be removed from semantic networks without negative impact on
      retrieval performance.

AB  - The abundance of publicly available life science databases offers a wealth of
      information that can support interpretation of experimentally derived data and
      greatly enhance hypothesis generation. Protein interaction and functional
      networks are not simply new renditions of existing data: they provide the
      opportunity to gain insights into the specific physical and functional role a
      protein plays as part of the biological system. In this chapter, we describe
      different in silico tools that can quickly and conveniently retrieve data from
      existing data repositories and we discuss how the available tools are best
      utilized for different purposes. While emphasizing protein-protein interaction
      databases (e.g., BioGrid and IntAct), we also introduce metasearch platforms such
      as STRING and GeneMANIA, pathway databases (e.g., BioCarta and Pathway Commons), 
      text mining approaches (e.g., PubMed and Chilibot), and resources for
      drug-protein interactions, genetic information for model organisms and gene
      expression information based on microarray data mining. Furthermore, we provide a
      simple step-by-step protocol for building customized protein-protein interaction 
      networks in Cytoscape, a powerful network assembly and visualization program,
      integrating data retrieved from these various databases. As we illustrate,
      generation of composite interaction networks enables investigators to extract
      significantly more information about a given biological system than utilization
      of a single database or sole reliance on primary literature.

TI  - Reconstruction of the experimentally supported human protein interactome: what
      can we learn?
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-7-96 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the topology and dynamics of the human protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network will significantly contribute to biomedical research,
      therefore its systematic reconstruction is required. Several meta-databases
      integrate source PPI datasets, but the protein node sets of their networks vary
      depending on the PPI data combined. Due to this inherent heterogeneity, the way
      in which the human PPI network expands via multiple dataset integration has not
      been comprehensively analyzed. We aim at assembling the human interactome in a
      global structured way and exploring it to gain insights of biological relevance. 
      RESULTS: First, we defined the UniProtKB manually reviewed human "complete"
      proteome as the reference protein-node set and then we mined five major source
      PPI datasets for direct PPIs exclusively between the reference proteins. We
      updated the protein and publication identifiers and normalized all PPIs to the
      UniProt identifier level. The reconstructed interactome covers approximately 60% 
      of the human proteome and has a scale-free structure. No apparent differentiating
      gene functional classification characteristics were identified for the
      unrepresented proteins. The source dataset integration augments the network
      mainly in PPIs. Polyubiquitin emerged as the highest-degree node, but the
      inclusion of most of its identified PPIs may be reconsidered. The high number
      (>300) of connections of the subsequent fifteen proteins correlates well with
      their essential biological role. According to the power-law network structure,
      the unrepresented proteins should mainly have up to four connections with equally
      poorly-connected interactors. CONCLUSIONS: Reconstructing the human interactome
      based on the a priori definition of the protein nodes enabled us to identify the 
      currently included part of the human "complete" proteome, and discuss the role of
      the proteins within the network topology with respect to their function. As the
      network expansion has to comply with the scale-free theory, we suggest that the
      core of the human interactome has essentially emerged. Thus, it could be employed
      in systems biology and biomedical research, despite the considerable number of
      currently unrepresented proteins. The latter are probably involved in specialized
      physiological conditions, justifying the scarcity of related PPI information, and
      their identification can assist in designing relevant functional experiments and 
      targeted text mining algorithms.

      through text mining].
PG  - 883-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the rules of clinical application of Shenmai Injection
      (SI). METHODS: The data sets of SI were downloaded from CBM database by the
      method of literature retrieved from Jan. 1980 to May 2012. Rules of Chinese
      medical patterns, diseases, symptoms, Chinese patent medicines (CPM), and Western
      medicine (WM) were mined out by data slicing algorithm, and they were
      demonstrated in frequency tables and two-dimension based network. RESULTS:
      Totally 3 159 literature were recruited. Results showed that SI was most
      frequently correlated with stasis syndrome and deficiency syndrome. Heart
      failure, arrhythmia, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, and shock were core
      diseases treated by SI. Symptoms such as angina pectoris, fatigue, chest
      tightness/pain were mainly relieved by SI. For CPM, SI was most commonly used
      with Compound Danshen Injection, Astragalus Injection, and so on. As for WM, SI
      was most commonly used with nitroglycerin, fructose, captopril, and so on.
      CONCLUSIONS: The syndrome types and mining results of SI were the same with its
      instructions. Stasis syndrome was the potential Chinese medical pattern of SI.
      Heart failure, arrhythmia, and myocardial infarction were potential diseases
      treated by SI. For CPM, SI was most commonly used with Danshen Injection,
      Compound Danshen Injection, and so on. And for WM, SI was most commonly used with
      nitroglycerin, fructose, captopril, and so on.

TI  - Integrated gene network analysis and text mining revealing PIK3R1 regulated by
      miR-127 in human bladder cancer.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/2047-783X-18-29 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer is the result of a complex multistep process that involves the
      accumulation of sequential alterations of several genes, including those encoding
      microRNAs (miRNAs) that have critical roles in the regulation of gene
      expression.In this study, we aimed to predict potential mechanisms of bladder
      cancer related miRNAs and target genes by bioinformatics analyses. METHODS: Here 
      we used the method of text mining to identify nine miRNAs in bladder cancer and
      adopted protein-protein interaction analysis to identify interaction sites
      between these miRNAs and related-target genes. RESULTS: There are two
      relationship types between bladder cancer and its related miRNAs: causal and
      unspecified. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment test
      showed that there were three pathways related to four miRNA targeted genes. The
      remaining five miRNAs annotated to disease are not enriched in the KEGG pathways.
      Of these, PIK3R1 is the overlapping gene among 38 genes in the cancer and bladder
      cancer pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the role
      of miRNAs in the pathway of cancer and give us a hypothesis that miR-127 might
      play a similar role in regulation and control of PIK3R1.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Estrogens are known to regulate the proliferation of breast cancer
      cells and to alter their cytoarchitectural and phenotypic properties, but the
      gene networks and pathways by which estrogenic hormones regulate these events are
      only partially understood. METHODS: We used global gene expression profiling by
      Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis, with KEGG pathway enrichment, PPI
      network construction, module analysis and text mining methods to identify
      patterns and time courses of genes that are either stimulated or inhibited by
      estradiol (E2) in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer
      cells. RESULTS: Of the genes queried on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0
      microarray, we identified 628 (12h), 852 (24h) and 880 (48 h) differentially
      expressed genes (DEGs) that showed a robust pattern of regulation by E2. From
      pathway enrichment analysis, we found out the changes of metabolic pathways of E2
      treated samples at each time point. At 12h time point, the changes of metabolic
      pathways were mainly focused on pathways in cancer, focal adhesion, and chemokine
      signaling pathway. At 24h time point, the changes were mainly enriched in
      neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
      and calcium signaling pathway. At 48 h time point, the significant pathways were 
      pathways in cancer, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules
      (CAMs), axon guidance and ErbB signaling pathway. Of interest, our PPI network
      analysis and module analysis found that E2 treatment induced enhancement of
      PRSS23 at the three time points and PRSS23 was in the central position of each
      module. Text mining results showed that the important genes of DEGs have
      relationship with signal pathways, such as ERbB pathway (AREG), Wnt pathway
      (NDP), MAPK pathway (NTRK3, TH), IP3 pathway (TRA@) and some transcript factors
      (TCF4, MAF). CONCLUSIONS: Our studies highlight the diverse gene networks and
      metabolic and cell regulatory pathways through which E2 operates to achieve its
      widespread effects on breast cancer cells.

TI  - Identifying phenotypic signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders from electronic
      medical records.
PG  - e297-305
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001933 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mental illness is the leading cause of disability in the USA, but
      boundaries between different mental illnesses are notoriously difficult to
      define. Electronic medical records (EMRs) have recently emerged as a powerful new
      source of information for defining the phenotypic signatures of specific
      diseases. We investigated how EMR-based text mining and statistical analysis
      could elucidate the phenotypic boundaries of three important neuropsychiatric
      illnesses-autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. METHODS: We analyzed the
      medical records of over 7000 patients at two facilities using an automated
      text-processing pipeline to annotate the clinical notes with Unified Medical
      Language System codes and then searching for enriched codes, and associations
      among codes, that were representative of the three disorders. We used
      dimensionality-reduction techniques on individual patient records to understand
      individual-level phenotypic variation within each disorder, as well as the degree
      of overlap among disorders. RESULTS: We demonstrate that automated EMR mining can
      be used to extract relevant drugs and phenotypes associated with neuropsychiatric
      disorders and characteristic patterns of associations among them. Patient-level
      analyses suggest a clear separation between autism and the other disorders, while
      revealing significant overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They
      also enable localization of individual patients within the phenotypic 'landscape'
      of each disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Because EMRs reflect the realities of patient care
      rather than idealized conceptualizations of disease states, we argue that
      automated EMR mining can help define the boundaries between different mental
      illnesses, facilitate cohort building for clinical and genomic studies, and
      reveal how clear expert-defined disease boundaries are in practice.

TI  - Biomedical hypothesis generation by text mining and gene prioritization.
PG  - 847-57
AB  - Text mining methods can facilitate the generation of biomedical hypotheses by
      suggesting novel associations between diseases and genes. Previously, we
      developed a rare-term model called RaJoLink (Petric et al, J. Biomed. Inform.
      42(2): 219-227, 2009) in which hypotheses are formulated on the basis of terms
      rarely associated with a target domain. Since many current medical hypotheses are
      formulated in terms of molecular entities and molecular mechanisms, here we
      extend the methodology to proteins and genes, using a standardized vocabulary as 
      well as a gene/protein network model. The proposed enhanced RaJoLink rare-term
      model combines text mining and gene prioritization approaches. Its utility is
      illustrated by finding known as well as potential gene-disease associations in
      ovarian cancer using MEDLINE abstracts and the STRING database.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), affecting >90% of the diabetic patients, is one
      of the major threats to human health. A comprehensive understanding of the
      mechanisms of T2D at molecular level is essential to facilitate the related
      translational research. Here, we introduce a comprehensive and up-to-date
      knowledgebase for T2D, i.e. T2D@ZJU. T2D@ZJU contains three levels of
      heterogeneous connections associated with T2D, which is retrieved from pathway
      databases, protein-protein interaction databases and literature, respectively. In
      current release, T2D@ZJU contains 1078 T2D related entities such as proteins,
      protein complexes, drugs and others together with their corresponding
      relationships, which include 3069 manually curated connections, 14,893
      protein-protein interactions and 26,716 relationships identified by text-mining
      technology. Moreover, T2D@ZJU provides a user-friendly web interface for users to
      browse and search data. A Cytoscape Web-based interactive network browser is
      available to visualize the corresponding network relationships between
      T2D-related entities. The functionality of T2D@ZJU is shown by means of several
      case studies. Database URL: http://tcm.zju.edu.cn/t2d.

PG  - bat047
LID - 10.1093/database/bat047 [doi]
AB  - Coronary heart disease (CHD), the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality
      in adults, has been reported to be associated with hundreds of genes. A
      comprehensive understanding of the CHD-related genes and their corresponding
      interactions is essential to advance the translational research on CHD.
      Accordingly, we construct this knowledgebase, CHD@ZJU, which records CHD-related 
      information (genes, pathways, drugs and references) collected from different
      resources and through text-mining method followed by manual confirmation. In
      current release, CHD@ZJU contains 660 CHD-related genes, 45 common pathways and
      1405 drugs accompanied with >8000 supporting references. Almost half of the genes
      collected in CHD@ZJU were novel to other publicly available CHD databases.
      Additionally, CHD@ZJU incorporated the protein-protein interactions to
      investigate the cross-talk within the pathways from a multi-layer network view.
      These functions offered by CHD@ZJU would allow researchers to dissect the
      molecular mechanism of CHD in a systematic manner and therefore facilitate the
      research on CHD-related multi-target therapeutic discovery. Database URL:

AB  - Intervertebral disc cells experience a broad range of physical stimuli under
      physiologic conditions, including alterations in their osmotic environment. The
      purpose of this study was to construct a text-mining network of the genes induced
      during the response to osmotic stimuli in the intervertebral disc. We obtained a 
      gene expression profile of human intervertebral disc cells from the National
      Center for Biotechnology Information, after culture under hyper- and hypo-osmotic
      conditions compared to iso-osmotic conditions, and we identified 65
      differentially expressed genes of intervertebral disc cells. We constructed a
      text-mining network using Biblio-MetReS between the differentially expressed
      genes and other genes that were included in the same document as the
      differentially expressed genes. Then, we performed pathway-enrichment analysis to
      identify the most relevant pathways for the response to osmotic stimuli in
      intervertebral disc cells. Our data provide a comprehensive bioinformatics
      analysis of genes and pathways that may be involved in the response to osmotic
      stimuli in the intervertebral disc.

TI  - Construction of protein phosphorylation networks by data mining, text mining and 
      ontology integration: analysis of the spindle checkpoint.
PG  - bat038
LID - 10.1093/database/bat038 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge representation of the role of phosphorylation is essential for the
      meaningful understanding of many biological processes. However, such a
      representation is challenging because proteins can exist in numerous
      phosphorylated forms with each one having its own characteristic protein-protein 
      interactions (PPIs), functions and subcellular localization. In this article, we 
      evaluate the current state of phosphorylation event curation and then present a
      bioinformatics framework for the annotation and representation of phosphorylated 
      proteins and construction of phosphorylation networks that addresses some of the 
      gaps in current curation efforts. The integrated approach involves (i) text
      mining guided by RLIMS-P, a tool that identifies phosphorylation-related
      information in scientific literature; (ii) data mining from curated PPI
      databases; (iii) protein form and complex representation using the Protein
      Ontology (PRO); (iv) functional annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO); and (v) 
      network visualization and analysis with Cytoscape. We use this framework to study
      the spindle checkpoint, the process that monitors the assembly of the mitotic
      spindle and blocks cell cycle progression at metaphase until all chromosomes have
      made bipolar spindle attachments. The phosphorylation networks we construct,
      centered on the human checkpoint kinase BUB1B (BubR1) and its yeast counterpart
      MAD3, offer a unique view of the spindle checkpoint that emphasizes biologically 
      relevant phosphorylated forms, phosphorylation-state-specific PPIs and
      kinase-substrate relationships. Our approach for constructing protein
      phosphorylation networks can be applied to any biological process that is
      affected by phosphorylation. Database URL: http://www.yeastgenome.org/

AB  - Despite the availability of various data repositories for plant research, a
      wealth of information currently remains hidden within the biomolecular
      literature. Text mining provides the necessary means to retrieve these data
      through automated processing of texts. However, only recently has advanced text
      mining methodology been implemented with sufficient computational power to
      process texts at a large scale. In this study, we assess the potential of
      large-scale text mining for plant biology research in general and for network
      biology in particular using a state-of-the-art text mining system applied to all 
      PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central full texts. We present extensive evaluation
      of the textual data for Arabidopsis thaliana, assessing the overall accuracy of
      this new resource for usage in plant network analyses. Furthermore, we combine
      text mining information with both protein-protein and regulatory interactions
      from experimental databases. Clusters of tightly connected genes are delineated
      from the resulting network, illustrating how such an integrative approach is
      essential to grasp the current knowledge available for Arabidopsis and to uncover
      gene information through guilt by association. All large-scale data sets, as well
      as the manually curated textual data, are made publicly available, hereby
      stimulating the application of text mining data in future plant biology studies.

TI  - Adverse drug events: database construction and in silico prediction.
PG  - 744-52
LID - 10.1021/ci4000079 [doi]
AB  - Adverse drug events (ADEs) are the harms associated with uses of given
      medications at normal dosages, which are crucial for a drug to be approved in
      clinical use or continue to stay on the market. Many ADEs are not identified in
      trials until the drug is approved for clinical use, which results in adverse
      morbidity and mortality. To date, millions of ADEs have been reported around the 
      world. Methods to avoid or reduce ADEs are an important issue for drug discovery 
      and development. Here, we reported a comprehensive database of adverse drug
      events (namely MetaADEDB), which included more than 520,000 drug-ADE associations
      among 3059 unique compounds (including 1330 drugs) and 13,200 ADE items by data
      integration and text mining. All compounds and ADEs were annotated with the most 
      commonly used concepts defined in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Meanwhile, a
      computational method, namely the phenotypic network inference model (PNIM), was
      developed for prediction of potential ADEs based on the database. The area under 
      the receive operating characteristic curve (AUC) is more than 0.9 by 10-fold
      cross validation, while the AUC value was 0.912 for an external validation set
      extracted from the US-FDA Adverse Events Reporting System, which indicated that
      the prediction capability of the method was reliable. MetaADEDB is accessible
      free of charge at http://www.lmmd.org/online_services/metaadedb/. The database
      and the method provide us a useful tool to search for known side effects or
      predict potential side effects for a given drug or compound.

TI  - Biological network extraction from scientific literature: state of the art and
      challenges.
PG  - 856-77
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbt006 [doi]
AB  - Networks of molecular interactions explain complex biological processes, and all 
      known information on molecular events is contained in a number of public
      repositories including the scientific literature. Metabolic and signalling
      pathways are often viewed separately, even though both types are composed of
      interactions involving proteins and other chemical entities. It is necessary to
      be able to combine data from all available resources to judge the functionality, 
      complexity and completeness of any given network overall, but especially the full
      integration of relevant information from the scientific literature is still an
      ongoing and complex task. Currently, the text-mining research community is
      steadily moving towards processing the full body of the scientific literature by 
      making use of rich linguistic features such as full text parsing, to extract
      biological interactions. The next step will be to combine these with information 
      from scientific databases to support hypothesis generation for the discovery of
      new knowledge and the extension of biological networks. The generation of
      comprehensive networks requires technologies such as entity grounding,
      coordination resolution and co-reference resolution, which are not fully solved
      and are required to further improve the quality of results. Here, we analyse the 
      state of the art for the extraction of network information from the scientific
      literature and the evaluation of extraction methods against reference corpora,
      discuss challenges involved and identify directions for future research.

TI  - Subcellular localization charts: a new visual methodology for the semi-automatic 
      localization of protein-related data sets.
PG  - 1340005
LID - 10.1142/S0219720013400052 [doi]
AB  - The CELLmicrocosmos PathwayIntegration (CmPI) was developed to support and
      visualize the subcellular localization prediction of protein-related data such as
      protein-interaction networks. From the start it was possible to manually analyze 
      the localizations by using an interactive table. It was, however, quite
      complicated to compare and analyze the different localization results derived
      from data integration as well as text-mining-based databases. The current
      software release provides a new interactive visual workflow, the Subcellular
      Localization Charts. As an application case, a MUPP1-related protein-protein
      interaction network is localized and semi-automatically analyzed. It will be
      shown that the workflow was dramatically improved and simplified. In addition, it
      is now possible to use custom protein-related data by using the SBML format and
      get a view of predicted protein localizations mapped onto a virtual cell model.

TI  - Computational construction of specialized biological networks.
PG  - 1340003
LID - 10.1142/S0219720013400039 [doi]
AB  - Today we have access to more than 1500 molecular database systems inside the
      internet. Based on these databases and information systems, computer scientists
      developed and implemented different methods for the automatic integration and
      prediction of biological networks. The idea is to use such methods for the
      automatic prediction and expansion of rudimentary molecular knowledge. However,
      the inherent data deficiency problem concerning the properties of specialized
      network hampers the database- and text-mining-based network construction. This
      paper presents the concept concerning the computational network expansion, namely
      for the specific biological network-thiol-disulfide redox regulatory network.
      Besides, a network-contexted document retrieval system (ncDocReSy) is also
      introduced to assist the network reduction by providing indirectly relevant
      literature for user's manual curation. NcDocReSy combines literature search with 
      biological network and ranks the retrieved literature according to the network
      topology. NcDocReSy is implemented as a Cytoscape plugin.

TI  - A negative selection heuristic to predict new transcriptional targets.
PG  - S3
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-14-S1-S3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supervised machine learning approaches have been recently adopted in 
      the inference of transcriptional targets from high throughput trascriptomic and
      proteomic data showing major improvements from with respect to the state of the
      art of reverse gene regulatory network methods. Beside traditional unsupervised
      techniques, a supervised classifier learns, from known examples, a function that 
      is able to recognize new relationships for new data. In the context of gene
      regulatory inference a supervised classifier is coerced to learn from positive
      and unlabeled examples, as the counter negative examples are unavailable or hard 
      to collect. Such a condition could limit the performance of the classifier
      especially when the amount of training examples is low. RESULTS: In this paper we
      improve the supervised identification of transcriptional targets by selecting
      reliable counter negative examples from the unlabeled set. We introduce an
      heuristic based on the known topology of transcriptional networks that in fact
      restores the conventional positive/negative training condition and shows a
      significant improvement of the classification performance. We empirically
      evaluate the proposed heuristic with the experimental datasets of Escherichia
      coli and show an example of application in the prediction of BCL6 direct core
      targets in normal germinal center human B cells obtaining a precision of 60%.
      CONCLUSIONS: The availability of only positive examples in learning
      transcriptional relationships negatively affects the performance of supervised
      classifiers. We show that the selection of reliable negative examples, a practice
      adopted in text mining approaches, improves the performance of such classifiers
      opening new perspectives in the identification of new transcriptional targets.

TI  - Expression microarray meta-analysis identifies genes associated with Ras/MAPK and
      related pathways in progression of muscle-invasive bladder transition cell
      carcinoma.
PG  - e55414
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0055414 [doi]
AB  - The effective detection and management of muscle-invasive bladder Transition Cell
      Carcinoma (TCC) continues to be an urgent clinical challenge. While some
      differences of gene expression and function in papillary (Ta), superficial (T1)
      and muscle-invasive (>/=T2) bladder cancers have been investigated, the
      understanding of mechanisms involved in the progression of bladder tumors remains
      incomplete. Statistical methods of pathway-enrichment, cluster analysis and
      text-mining can extract and help interpret functional information about gene
      expression patterns in large sets of genomic data. The public availability of
      patient-derived expression microarray data allows open access and analysis of
      large amounts of clinical data. Using these resources, we investigated gene
      expression differences associated with tumor progression and muscle-invasive TCC.
      Gene expression was calculated relative to Ta tumors to assess
      progression-associated differences, revealing a network of genes related to
      Ras/MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways with increased expression. Further, we
      identified genes within this network that are similarly expressed in superficial 
      Ta and T1 stages but altered in muscle-invasive T2 tumors, finding 7 genes
      (COL3A1, COL5A1, COL11A1, FN1, ErbB3, MAPK10 and CDC25C) whose expression
      patterns in muscle-invasive tumors are consistent in 5 to 7 independent outside
      microarray studies. Further, we found increased expression of the fibrillar
      collagen proteins COL3A1 and COL5A1 in muscle-invasive tumor samples and
      metastatic T24 cells. Our results suggest that increased expression of genes
      involved in mitogenic signaling may support the progression of muscle-invasive
      bladder tumors that generally lack activating mutations in these pathways, while 
      expression changes of fibrillar collagens, fibronectin and specific signaling
      proteins are associated with muscle-invasive disease. These results identify
      potential biomarkers and targets for TCC treatments, and provide an integrated
      systems-level perspective of TCC pathobiology to inform future studies.

TI  - Protein network-based Lasso regression model for the construction of
      disease-miRNA functional interactions.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/1687-4153-2013-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence associating microRNAs (miRNAs)
      with human diseases. MiRNAs are new key players in the disease paradigm
      demonstrating roles in several human diseases. The functional association between
      miRNAs and diseases remains largely unclear and far from complete. With the
      advent of high-throughput functional genomics techniques that infer genes and
      biological pathways dysregulted in diseases, it is now possible to infer
      functional association between diseases and biological molecules by integrating
      disparate biological information. RESULTS: Here, we first used Lasso regression
      model to identify miRNAs associated with disease signature as a proof of concept.
      Then we proposed an integrated approach that uses disease-gene associations from 
      microarray experiments and text mining, and miRNA-gene association from
      computational predictions and protein networks to build functional associations
      network between miRNAs and diseases. The findings of the proposed model were
      validated against gold standard datasets using ROC analysis and results were
      promising (AUC=0.81). Our protein network-based approach discovered 19 new
      functional associations between prostate cancer and miRNAs. The new 19
      associations were validated using miRNA expression data and clinical profiles and
      showed to act as diagnostic and prognostic prostate biomarkers. The proposed
      integrated approach allowed us to reconstruct functional associations between
      miRNAs and human diseases and uncovered functional roles of newly discovered
      miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Lasso regression was used to find associations between
      diseases and miRNAs using their gene signature. Defining miRNA gene signature by 
      integrating the downstream effect of miRNAs demonstrated better performance than 
      the miRNA signature alone. Integrating biological networks and multiple data to
      define miRNA and disease gene signature demonstrated high performance to uncover 
      new functional associations between miRNAs and diseases.

TI  - Preparing Electronic Clinical Data for Quality Improvement and Comparative
      Effectiveness Research: The SCOAP CERTAIN Automation and Validation Project.
PG  - 1025
LID - 10.13063/2327-9214.1025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The field of clinical research informatics includes creation of
      clinical data repositories (CDRs) used to conduct quality improvement (QI)
      activities and comparative effectiveness research (CER). Ideally, CDR data are
      accurately and directly abstracted from disparate electronic health records
      (EHRs), across diverse health-systems. OBJECTIVE: Investigators from Washington
      State's Surgical Care Outcomes and Assessment Program (SCOAP) Comparative
      Effectiveness Research Translation Network (CERTAIN) are creating such a CDR.
      This manuscript describes the automation and validation methods used to create
      this digital infrastructure. METHODS: SCOAP is a QI benchmarking initiative. Data
      are manually abstracted from EHRs and entered into a data management system.
      CERTAIN investigators are now deploying Caradigm's Amalga tool to facilitate
      automated abstraction of data from multiple, disparate EHRs. Concordance is
      calculated to compare data automatically to manually abstracted. Performance
      measures are calculated between Amalga and each parent EHR. Validation takes
      place in repeated loops, with improvements made over time. When automated
      abstraction reaches the current benchmark for abstraction accuracy - 95% - itwill
      'go-live' at each site. PROGRESS TO DATE: A technical analysis was completed at
      14 sites. Five sites are contributing; the remaining sites prioritized meeting
      Meaningful Use criteria. Participating sites are contributing 15-18 unique data
      feeds, totaling 13 surgical registry use cases. Common feeds are registration,

      50% of 1,320 designated data elements are being automatically abstracted-25% from

      clusters associated with antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A major goal of the field of systems biology is to translate
      genome-wide profiling data (e.g., mRNAs, miRNAs) into interpretable functional
      networks. However, employing a systems biology approach to better understand the 
      complexities underlying drug resistance phenotypes in cancer continues to
      represent a significant challenge to the field. Previously, we derived two
      drug-resistant breast cancer sublines (tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant cell 
      lines) from the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and performed genome-wide mRNA and
      microRNA profiling to identify differential molecular pathways underlying
      acquired resistance to these important antiestrogens. In the current study, to
      further define molecular characteristics of acquired antiestrogen resistance we
      constructed an "integrative network". We combined joint miRNA-mRNA expression
      profiles, cancer contexts, miRNA-target mRNA relationships, and miRNA upstream
      regulators. In particular, to reduce the probability of false positive
      connections in the network, experimentally validated, rather than
      prediction-oriented, databases were utilized to obtain connectivity. Also, to
      improve biological interpretation, cancer contexts were incorporated into the
      network connectivity. RESULTS: Based on the integrative network, we extracted
      "substructures" (network clusters) representing the drug resistant states
      (tamoxifen- or fulvestrant-resistance cells) compared to drug sensitive state
      (parental MCF7 cells). We identified un-described network clusters that
      contribute to antiestrogen resistance consisting of miR-146a, -27a, -145, -21,
      -155, -15a, -125b, and let-7s, in addition to the previously described
      miR-221/222. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating miRNA-related network, gene/miRNA
      expression and text-mining, the current study provides a computational-based
      systems biology approach for further investigating the molecular mechanism
      underlying antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cells. In addition, new miRNA
      clusters that contribute to antiestrogen resistance were identified, and they
      warrant further investigation.

TI  - TCMID: Traditional Chinese Medicine integrative database for herb molecular
      mechanism analysis.
PG  - D1089-95
LID - 10.1093/nar/gks1100 [doi]
AB  - As an alternative to modern western medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
      is receiving increasingly attention worldwide. Great efforts have been paid to
      TCM's modernization, which tries to bridge the gap between TCM and modern western
      medicine. As TCM and modern western medicine share a common aspect at molecular
      level that the compound(s) perturb human's dysfunction network and restore human 
      normal physiological condition, the relationship between compounds (in herb,
      refer to ingredients) and their targets (proteins) should be the key factor to
      connect TCM and modern medicine. Accordingly, we construct this Traditional
      Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID, http://www.megabionet.org/tcmid/),
      which records TCM-related information collected from different resources and
      through text-mining method. To enlarge the scope of the TCMID, the data have been
      linked to common drug and disease databases, including Drugbank, OMIM and
      PubChem. Currently, our TCMID contains approximately 47 000 prescriptions, 8159
      herbs, 25 210 compounds, 6828 drugs, 3791 diseases and 17 521 related targets,
      which is the largest data set for related field. Our web-based software displays 
      a network for integrative relationships between herbs and their treated diseases,
      the active ingredients and their targets, which will facilitate the study of
      combination therapy and understanding of the underlying mechanisms for TCM at
      molecular level.

AB  - Different programs of The European Science Foundation (ESF) have contributed
      significantly to connect researchers in Europe and beyond through several
      initiatives. This support was particularly relevant for the development of the
      areas related with extracting information from papers (text-mining) because it
      supported the field in its early phases long before it was recognized by the
      community. We review the historical development of text mining research and how
      it was introduced in bioinformatics. Specific applications in (functional)
      genomics are described like it's integration in genome annotation pipelines and
      the support to the analysis of high-throughput genomics experimental data, and we
      highlight the activities of evaluation of methods and benchmarking for which the 
      ESF programme support was instrumental.

AB  - The pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is driven by a complex,
      multi-facetted interplay of numerous molecular processes (protective as well as
      damaging) and the balance between these, rather than the activity of a single
      pathway, determines clinical presentation and outcome. We present a concept for
      deriving a biomarker panel aimed to represent the relevant processes involved.
      Our approach rests on a hybrid gene/protein interaction network that holds ample 
      information on molecular features (nodes) and their relations (edges), as a
      result providing a basic structure to navigate in molecular content and context
      being identified as relevant in DN. Extensive literature search on omics studies 
      in DN provided a molecular feature list mapping to a total of 2175 unique
      protein-coding genes [13 from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 12 as
      targets from relevant miRNAs, 1583 from transcriptomics, 5 from proteomics and 53
      from metabolomics via linking to enzymes; 509 features were identified from
      multiple sources]. Two hundred and eighty-seven further human protein-coding
      genes associated with DN were derived from searching NCBI Pubmed (utilizing MeSH 
      and gene-to-pubmed). Text mining of patents and clinical trial descriptors in the
      context of DN further added about 1,000 features. These data were used to label
      the respective nodes in the interaction network, as a result obtaining a
      DN-specific subgraph. Application of a segmentation algorithm on this subgraph
      allowed the identification of DN-specific molecular units, each characterizing a 
      cluster of genes/proteins with a high internal functional association. We
      interpret each such unit as a functionally relevant molecular process
      contributing to the presentation of DN, and the total set of such units as a
      molecular model of DN. We propose that selecting appropriate biomarkers from each
      unit might allow the description of a patient's specific 'type' of DN, ultimately
      leading to a better stratification of patients regarding progression risk and
      optimal interventional approach.

TI  - A predicted miR-27a-mediated network identifies a signature of glioma.
PG  - 1249-56
LID - 10.3892/or.2012.1955 [doi]
AB  - The dysregulation of physiological microRNA (miRNA) activity has been shown to
      play an important role in gliomagenesis. In a previous study, using microRNA
      arrays and glioma tissues found that miR-27a was upregulated, which was also
      identified in the glioma cell lines and samples by quantitative real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In this study, in order to explore the
      potential roles of miR-27a in the progression of glioma, we first utilized
      text-mining of PubMed abstracts with natural language processing (NLP) to
      identify 1,168 glioma-related molecules. In addition, miR-27a targets predicted
      by computational methods were integrated with the results from NLP analysis,
      followed by Gene Ontology (GO), pathway and network analysis. We identified 33
      hub genes by overlap calculation and demonstrated that miR-27a may be involved in
      the progression of glioma through adherens junction, focal adhesion, the
      neurotrophin signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, the transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor
      interactions, the p53 signaling pathway, the apoptotic signaling pathway, as well
      as others. Our data may provide researchers with a better understanding of the
      mechanisms of the miR-27a-target network in glioma initiation and progression.

TI  - Preeclampsia: a bioinformatics approach through protein-protein interaction
      networks analysis.
PG  - 97
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-6-97 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we explored preeclampsia through a bioinformatics
      approach. We create a comprehensive genes/proteins dataset by the analysis of
      both public proteomic data and text mining of public scientific literature. From 
      this dataset the associated protein-protein interaction network has been
      obtained. Several indexes of centrality have been explored for hubs detection as 
      well as the enrichment statistical analysis of metabolic pathway and disease.
      RESULTS: We confirmed the well known relationship between preeclampsia and
      cardiovascular diseases but also identified statistically significant
      relationships with respect to cancer and aging. Moreover, significant metabolic
      pathways such as apoptosis, cancer and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
      have also been identified by enrichment analysis. We obtained FLT1, VEGFA, FN1,
      F2 and PGF genes with the highest scores by hubs analysis; however, we also found
      other genes as PDIA3, LYN, SH2B2 and NDRG1 with high scores. CONCLUSIONS: The
      applied methodology not only led to the identification of well known genes
      related to preeclampsia but also to propose new candidates poorly explored or
      completely unknown in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, which eventually need to 
      be validated experimentally. Moreover, new possible connections were detected
      between preeclampsia and other diseases that could open new areas of research.
      More must be done in this area to resolve the identification of unknown
      interactions of proteins/genes and also for a better integration of metabolic
      pathways and diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological entities do not perform in isolation, and often, it is the
      nature and degree of interactions among numerous biological entities which
      ultimately determines any final outcome. Hence, experimental data on any single
      biological entity can be of limited value when considered only in isolation. To
      address this, we propose that augmenting individual entity data with the
      literature will not only better define the entity's own significance but also
      uncover relationships with novel biological entities.To test this notion, we
      developed a comprehensive text mining and computational methodology that focused 
      on discovering new targets of one class of molecular entities, transcription
      factors (TF), within one particular disease, colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: We
      used 39 molecular entities known to be associated with CRC along with six
      colorectal cancer terms as the bait list, or list of search terms, for mining the
      biomedical literature to identify CRC-specific genes and proteins. Using the
      literature-mined data, we constructed a global TF interaction network for CRC. We
      then developed a multi-level, multi-parametric methodology to identify TFs to
      CRC. RESULTS: The small bait list, when augmented with literature-mined data,
      identified a large number of biological entities associated with CRC. The
      relative importance of these TF and their associated modules was identified using
      functional and topological features. Additional validation of these highly-ranked
      TF using the literature strengthened our findings. Some of the novel TF that we
      identified were: SLUG, RUNX1, IRF1, HIF1A, ATF-2, ABL1, ELK-1 and GATA-1. Some of
      these TFs are associated with functional modules in known pathways of CRC,
      including the Beta-catenin/development, immune response, transcription, and DNA
      damage pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our methodology of using text mining data and a
      multi-level, multi-parameter scoring technique was able to identify both known
      and novel TF that have roles in CRC. Starting with just one TF (SMAD3) in the
      bait list, the literature mining process identified an additional 116
      CRC-associated TFs. Our network-based analysis showed that these TFs all belonged
      to any of 13 major functional groups that are known to play important roles in
      CRC. Among these identified TFs, we obtained a novel six-node module consisting
      of ATF2-P53-JNK1-ELK1-EPHB2-HIF1A, from which the novel JNK1-ELK1 association
      could potentially be a significant marker for CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) have long been known to be principally
      activators of transcription in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The growing awareness 
      of the ubiquity of microRNAs (miRNAs) as suppressive regulators in eukaryotes,
      suggests the possibility of a mutual, preferential, self-regulatory connectivity 
      between miRNAs and TFs. Here we investigate the connectivity from TFs and miRNAs 
      to other genes and each other using text mining, TF promoter binding site and 6
      different miRNA binding site prediction methods. RESULTS: In the first approach
      text mining of PubMed abstracts reveal statistically significant associations
      between miRNAs and both TFs and signal transduction gene classes. Secondly,
      prediction of miRNA targets in human and mouse 3'UTRs show enrichment only for
      TFs but not consistently across prediction methods for signal transduction or
      other gene classes. Furthermore, a random sample of 986 TarBase entries was
      scored for experimental evidence by manual inspection of the original papers, and
      enrichment for TFs was observed to increase with score. Low-scoring TarBase
      entries, where experimental evidence is anticorrelated miRNA:mRNA expression with
      predicted miRNA targets, appear not to select for real miRNA targets to any
      degree. Our manually validated text-mining results also suggests that miRNAs may 
      be activated by more TFs than other classes of genes, as 7% of miRNA:TF
      co-occurrences in the literature were TFs activating miRNAs. This was confirmed
      when thirdly, we found enrichment for predicted, conserved TF binding sites in
      miRNA and TF genes compared to other gene classes. CONCLUSIONS: We see enrichment
      of connections between miRNAs and TFs using several independent methods,
      suggestive of a network of mutual activating and suppressive regulation. We have 
      also built regulatory networks (containing 2- and 3-loop motifs) for mouse and
      human using predicted miRNA and TF binding sites and we have developed a web
      server to search and display these loops, available for the community at
      http://rth.dk/resources/tfmirloop.

AB  - Network-based analysis is indispensable in analyzing high-throughput biological
      data. Based on the assumption that the variation of gene interactions under given
      biological conditions could be better interpreted in the context of a large-scale
      and wide variety of developmental, tissue, and disease conditions, we leverage
      the large quantity of publicly available transcriptomic data >40,000 HG U133A
      Affymetrix microarray chips stored in ArrayExpress
      (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) using MetaOmGraph
      (http://metnet.vrac.iastate.edu/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm). From this data, 18,637
      chips encompassing over 500 experiments containing high-quality data (18637
      Hu-dataset) were used to create a globally stable gene co-expression network
      (18637 Hu-co-expression-network). Regulons, groups of highly and consistently
      co-expressed genes, were obtained by partitioning the 18637
      Hu-co-expression-network using an Markov clustering algorithm (MCL). The regulons
      were demonstrated to be statistically significant using a gene ontology (GO) term
      overrepresentation test combined with evaluation of the effects of gene
      permutations. The regulons include ca. 12% of human genes, interconnected by
      31,471 correlations. All network data and metadata are publically available
      (http://metnet.vrac.iastate.edu/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm). Text mining of these
      metadata, GO term overrepresentation analysis, and statistical analysis of
      transcriptomic experiments across multiple environmental, tissue, and disease
      conditions, has revealed novel fingerprints distinguishing central nervous system
      (CNS)-related conditions. This study demonstrates the value of mega-scale
      network-based analysis for biologists to further refine transcriptomic data,
      derived from a particular condition, to study the global relationships between
      genes and diseases, and to develop hypotheses that can inform future research.

TI  - Coreference resolution of medical concepts in discharge summaries by exploiting
      contextual information.
PG  - 888-96
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000808 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patient discharge summaries provide detailed medical information about
      hospitalized patients and are a rich resource of data for clinical record text
      mining. The textual expressions of this information are highly variable. In order
      to acquire a precise understanding of the patient, it is important to uncover the
      relationship between all instances in the text. In natural language processing
      (NLP), this task falls under the category of coreference resolution. DESIGN: A
      key contribution of this paper is the application of contextual-dependent rules
      that describe relationships between coreference pairs. To resolve phrases that
      refer to the same entity, the authors use these rules in three representative NLP
      systems: one rule-based, another based on the maximum entropy model, and the last
      a system built on the Markov logic network (MLN) model. RESULTS: The experimental
      results show that the proposed MLN-based system outperforms the baseline system
      (exact match) by average F-scores of 4.3% and 5.7% on the Beth and Partners
      datasets, respectively. Finally, the three systems were integrated into an
      ensemble system, further improving performance to 87.21%, which is 4.5% more than
      the official i2b2 Track 1C average (82.7%). CONCLUSION: In this paper, the main
      challenges in the resolution of coreference relations in patient discharge
      summaries are described. Several rules are proposed to exploit contextual
      information, and three approaches presented. While single systems provided
      promising results, an ensemble approach combining the three systems produced a
      better performance than even the best single system.

TI  - Protease-associated cellular networks in malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
PG  - S9
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-12-S5-S9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be one of the most severe global infectious
      diseases, responsible for 1-2 million deaths yearly. The rapid evolution and
      spread of drug resistance in parasites has led to an urgent need for the
      development of novel antimalarial targets. Proteases are a group of enzymes that 
      play essential roles in parasite growth and invasion. The possibility of
      designing specific inhibitors for proteases makes them promising drug targets.
      Previously, combining a comparative genomics approach and a machine learning
      approach, we identified the complement of proteases (degradome) in the malaria
      parasite Plasmodium falciparum and its sibling species 123, providing a catalog
      of targets for functional characterization and rational inhibitor design. Network
      analysis represents another route to revealing the role of proteins in the
      biology of parasites and we use this approach here to expand our understanding of
      the systems involving the proteases of P. falciparum. RESULTS: We investigated
      the roles of proteases in the parasite life cycle by constructing a network using
      protein-protein association data from the STRING database 4, and analyzing these 
      data, in conjunction with the data from protein-protein interaction assays using 
      the yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) system 5, blood stage microarray experiments 678,
      proteomics 9101112, literature text mining, and sequence homology analysis.
      Seventy-seven (77) out of 124 predicted proteases were associated with at least
      one other protein, constituting 2,431 protein-protein interactions (PPIs). These 
      proteases appear to play diverse roles in metabolism, cell cycle regulation,
      invasion and infection. Their degrees of connectivity (i.e., connections to other
      proteins), range from one to 143. The largest protease-associated sub-network is 
      the ubiquitin-proteasome system which is crucial for protein recycling and stress
      response. Proteases are also implicated in heat shock response, signal peptide
      processing, cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and signal
      transduction networks. CONCLUSIONS: Our network analysis of proteases from P.
      falciparum uses a so-called guilt-by-association approach to extract sets of
      proteins from the proteome that are candidates for further study. Novel protease 
      targets and previously unrecognized members of the protease-associated
      sub-systems provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying parasitism,
      pathogenesis and virulence.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00051 [doi]
AB  - Discovery of essential genes in pathogenic organisms is an important step in the 
      development of new medication. Despite a growing number of genome data available,
      little is known about C. albicans, a major fungal pathogen. Most of the human
      population carries C. albicans as commensal, but it can cause systemic infection 
      that may lead to the death of the host if the immune system has deteriorated. In 
      many organisms central nodes in the interaction network (hubs) play a crucial
      role for information and energy transport. Knock-outs of such hubs often lead to 
      lethal phenotypes making them interesting drug targets. To identify these central
      genes via topological analysis, we inferred gene regulatory networks that are
      sparse and scale-free. We collected information from various sources to
      complement the limited expression data available. We utilized a linear regression
      algorithm to infer genome-wide gene regulatory interaction networks. To evaluate 
      the predictive power of our approach, we used an automated text-mining system
      that scanned full-text research papers for known interactions. With the help of
      the compendium of known interactions, we also optimize the influence of the prior
      knowledge and the sparseness of the model to achieve the best results. We compare
      the results of our approach with those of other state-of-the-art network
      inference methods and show that we outperform those methods. Finally we identify 
      a number of hubs in the genome of the fungus and investigate their biological
      relevance.

TI  - [Symptom-based traditional Chinese medicine slices relationship network and its
      network pharmacology study].
PG  - 2916-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discover and interpret the correlations between traditional Chinese
      medicine (TCM) slices and their properties such as function, symptom and channel 
      tropism by constructing the relationship network using network pharmacology
      approaches. METHOD: TCM slices related information was extracted from Chinese
      Pharmacopeia (2010 edition, volume I) by text mining, and was used to construct
      the TCM slices-symptom relationship network. The corresponding network analysis
      was also performed. RESULT: Three thousands and sixteen pair of TCM slice-symptom
      correlation associated with 646 TCM slices was discovered, and the constructed
      network unfolded the complex relationships between TCM slices. Further network
      analysis results indicated that the un-annotated function and channel tropism of 
      TCM slice can be revealed by proposed symptom-based network. CONCLUSION: Network 
      pharmacology approaches can be applied in TCM research to discover and interpret 
      the relationships between TCM slices and their properties.

TI  - Associating Drugs, Targets and Clinical Outcomes into an Integrated Network
      Affords a New Platform for Computer-Aided Drug Repurposing.
PG  - 100-111
AB  - Finding new uses for old drugs is a strategy embraced by the pharmaceutical
      industry, with increasing participation from the academic sector. Drug
      repurposing efforts focus on identifying novel modes of action, but not in a
      systematic manner. With intensive data mining and curation, we aim to apply bio- 
      and cheminformatics tools using the DRUGS database, containing 3,837 unique small
      molecules annotated on 1,750 proteins. These are likely to serve as drug targets 
      and antitargets (i.e., associated with side effects, SE). The academic community,
      the pharmaceutical sector and clinicians alike could benefit from an integrated, 
      semantic-web compliant computer-aided drug repurposing (CADR) effort, one that
      would enable deep data mining of associations between approved drugs (D), targets
      (T), clinical outcomes (CO) and SE. We report preliminary results from text
      mining and multivariate statistics, based on 7,684 approved drug labels, ADL
      (Dailymed) via text mining. From the ADL corresponding to 988 unique drugs, the
      "adverse reactions" section was mapped onto 174 SE, then clustered via principal 
      component analysis into a 5x5 self-organizing map that was integrated into a
      Cytoscape network of SE-D-T-CO. This type of data can be used to streamline drug 
      repurposing and may result in novel insights that can lead to the identification 
      of novel drug actions.

TI  - E3Net: a system for exploring E3-mediated regulatory networks of cellular
      functions.
PG  - O111.014076
LID - 10.1074/mcp.O111.014076 [doi]
AB  - Ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) is a key enzyme targeting specific substrates in
      diverse cellular processes for ubiquitination and degradation. The existing
      findings of substrate specificity of E3 are, however, scattered over a number of 
      resources, making it difficult to study them together with an integrative view.
      Here we present E3Net, a web-based system that provides a comprehensive
      collection of available E3-substrate specificities and a systematic framework for
      the analysis of E3-mediated regulatory networks of diverse cellular functions.
      Currently, E3Net contains 2201 E3s and 4896 substrates in 427 organisms and 1671 
      E3-substrate specific relations between 493 E3s and 1277 substrates in 42
      organisms, extracted mainly from MEDLINE abstracts and UniProt comments with an
      automatic text mining method and additional manual inspection and partly from
      high throughput experiment data and public ubiquitination databases. The
      significant functions and pathways of the extracted E3-specific substrate groups 
      were identified from a functional enrichment analysis with 12 functional category
      resources for molecular functions, protein families, protein complexes, pathways,
      cellular processes, cellular localization, and diseases. E3Net includes
      interactive analysis and navigation tools that make it possible to build an
      integrative view of E3-substrate networks and their correlated functions with
      graphical illustrations and summarized descriptions. As a result, E3Net provides 
      a comprehensive resource of E3s, substrates, and their functional implications
      summarized from the regulatory network structures of E3-specific substrate groups
      and their correlated functions. This resource will facilitate further in-depth
      investigation of ubiquitination-dependent regulatory mechanisms. E3Net is freely 
      available online at http://pnet.kaist.ac.kr/e3net.

TI  - Translating clinical findings into knowledge in drug safety evaluation--drug
      induced liver injury prediction system (DILIps).
PG  - e1002310
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002310 [doi]
AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a significant concern in drug development due
      to the poor concordance between preclinical and clinical findings of liver
      toxicity. We hypothesized that the DILI types (hepatotoxic side effects) seen in 
      the clinic can be translated into the development of predictive in silico models 
      for use in the drug discovery phase. We identified 13 hepatotoxic side effects
      with high accuracy for classifying marketed drugs for their DILI potential. We
      then developed in silico predictive models for each of these 13 side effects,
      which were further combined to construct a DILI prediction system (DILIps). The
      DILIps yielded 60-70% prediction accuracy for three independent validation sets. 
      To enhance the confidence for identification of drugs that cause severe DILI in
      humans, the "Rule of Three" was developed in DILIps by using a consensus strategy
      based on 13 models. This gave high positive predictive value (91%) when applied
      to an external dataset containing 206 drugs from three independent literature
      datasets. Using the DILIps, we screened all the drugs in DrugBank and
      investigated their DILI potential in terms of protein targets and therapeutic
      categories through network modeling. We demonstrated that two therapeutic
      categories, anti-infectives for systemic use and musculoskeletal system drugs,
      were enriched for DILI, which is consistent with current knowledge. We also
      identified protein targets and pathways that are related to drugs that cause DILI
      by using pathway analysis and co-occurrence text mining. While marketed drugs
      were the focus of this study, the DILIps has a potential as an evaluation tool to
      screen and prioritize new drug candidates or chemicals, such as environmental
      chemicals, to avoid those that might cause liver toxicity. We expect that the
      methodology can be also applied to other drug safety endpoints, such as renal or 
      cardiovascular toxicity.

TI  - Constructing a semantic predication gold standard from the biomedical literature.
PG  - 486
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-486 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Semantic relations increasingly underpin biomedical text mining and
      knowledge discovery applications. The success of such practical applications
      crucially depends on the quality of extracted relations, which can be assessed
      against a gold standard reference. Most such references in biomedical text mining
      focus on narrow subdomains and adopt different semantic representations,
      rendering them difficult to use for benchmarking independently developed relation
      extraction systems. In this article, we present a multi-phase gold standard
      annotation study, in which we annotated 500 sentences randomly selected from
      MEDLINE abstracts on a wide range of biomedical topics with 1371 semantic
      predications. The UMLS Metathesaurus served as the main source for conceptual
      information and the UMLS Semantic Network for relational information. We measured
      interannotator agreement and analyzed the annotations closely to identify some of
      the challenges in annotating biomedical text with relations based on an ontology 
      or a terminology. RESULTS: We obtain fair to moderate interannotator agreement in
      the practice phase (0.378-0.475). With improved guidelines and additional
      semantic equivalence criteria, the agreement increases by 12% (0.415 to 0.536) in
      the main annotation phase. In addition, we find that agreement increases to 0.688
      when the agreement calculation is limited to those predications that are based
      only on the explicitly provided UMLS concepts and relations. CONCLUSIONS: While
      interannotator agreement in the practice phase confirms that conceptual
      annotation is a challenging task, the increasing agreement in the main annotation
      phase points out that an acceptable level of agreement can be achieved in
      multiple iterations, by setting stricter guidelines and establishing semantic
      equivalence criteria. Mapping text to ontological concepts emerges as the main
      challenge in conceptual annotation. Annotating predications involving
      biomolecular entities and processes is particularly challenging. While the
      resulting gold standard is mainly intended to serve as a test collection for our 
      semantic interpreter, we believe that the lessons learned are applicable
      generally.

AB  - We have developed a system called megNet for integrating and visualizing
      heterogeneous biological data in order to enable modeling biological phenomena
      using a systems approach. Herein we describe megNet, including a recently
      developed user interface for visualizing biological networks in three dimensions 
      and a web user interface for taking input parameters from the user, and an
      in-house text mining system that utilizes an existing knowledge base. We
      demonstrate the software with a case study in which we integrate lipidomics data 
      acquired in-house with interaction data from external databases, and then find
      novel interactions that could possibly explain our previous associations between 
      biological data and medical images. The flexibility of megNet assures that the
      tool can be applied in diverse applications, from target discovery in medical
      applications to metabolic engineering in industrial biotechnology.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of electronic medical record in Japan varies according
      to the size of the hospital which is 62.5% in major hospitals, 21.7% in medium,
      9.1% in small size hospitals, and 16.5% in clinics. The complete paperless system
      is very limited, though some major hospitals are aiming at this system. Several
      regional network systems which connect different platforms of EMRs, have been
      developing in many districts, while the final picture of a regional network has
      not been clearly proposed. To develop a whole electronic health record or
      personal health records system from the regional network data, we have several
      obstacles to overcome such as standardization, a privacy act, unique national
      health number. METHODS: Some experimental trials have just been started. The
      reuse of the accumulated data has also just been initiated. We exploited text
      mining systems (term frequency-inverse document frequency method) to find similar
      cases and auto-audit Japanese diagnosis related group (DRG) coding by using
      discharge summaries. RESULTS: The same or even a more extreme phenomenon of huge 
      data accumulation is occurring in genetic research and confluence of
      multi-disciplines of informatics is the next step, which has an enormous
      accumulation of data and discoveries of the relations beyond the dimension of
      each informatics. CONCLUSIONS: We need another approach to science apart from the
      conventional method, and data-driven approach with data mining techniques must be
      brought in for each field. Informaticians have new important roles as
      coordinators to link up numerous phenomena over dimensions.

TI  - STITCH 3: zooming in on protein-chemical interactions.
PG  - D876-80
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkr1011 [doi]
AB  - To facilitate the study of interactions between proteins and chemicals, we have
      created STITCH, an aggregated database of interactions connecting over 300,000
      chemicals and 2.6 million proteins from 1133 organisms. Compared to the previous 
      version, the number of chemicals with interactions and the number of
      high-confidence interactions both increase 4-fold. The database can be accessed
      interactively through a web interface, displaying interactions in an integrated
      network view. It is also available for computational studies through downloadable
      files and an API. As an extension in the current version, we offer the option to 
      switch between two levels of detail, namely whether stereoisomers of a given
      compound are shown as a merged entity or as separate entities. Separate display
      of stereoisomers is necessary, for example, for carbohydrates and chiral drugs.
      Combining the isomers increases the coverage, as interaction databases and
      publications found through text mining will often refer to compounds without
      specifying the stereoisomer. The database is accessible at
      http://stitch.embl.de/.

      from PubMed queries.
PG  - 435
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-435 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological function is greatly dependent on the interactions of
      proteins with other proteins and genes. Abstracts from the biomedical literature 
      stored in the NCBI's PubMed database can be used for the derivation of
      interactions between genes and proteins by identifying the co-occurrences of
      their terms. Often, the amount of interactions obtained through such an approach 
      is large and may mix processes occurring in different contexts. Current tools do 
      not allow studying these data with a focus on concepts of relevance to a user,
      for example, interactions related to a disease or to a biological mechanism such 
      as protein aggregation. RESULTS: To help the concept-oriented exploration of such
      data we developed PESCADOR, a web tool that extracts a network of interactions
      from a set of PubMed abstracts given by a user, and allows filtering the
      interaction network according to user-defined concepts. We illustrate its use in 
      exploring protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease and in the expansion
      of pathways associated to colon cancer. CONCLUSIONS: PESCADOR is a platform
      independent web resource available at: http://cbdm.mdc-berlin.de/tools/pescador/

PG  - 387
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of genes and/or protein networks from automated
      analysis of the literature is one of the current targets of text mining in
      biomedical research. Some user-friendly tools already perform this analysis on
      precompiled databases of abstracts of scientific papers. Other tools allow expert
      users to elaborate and analyze the full content of a corpus of scientific
      documents. However, to our knowledge, no user friendly tool that simultaneously
      analyzes the latest set of scientific documents available on line and
      reconstructs the set of genes referenced in those documents is available.
      RESULTS: This article presents such a tool, Biblio-MetReS, and compares its
      functioning and results to those of other user-friendly applications (iHOP,
      STRING) that are widely used. Under similar conditions, Biblio-MetReS creates
      networks that are comparable to those of other user friendly tools. Furthermore, 
      analysis of full text documents provides more complete reconstructions than those
      that result from using only the abstract of the document. CONCLUSIONS:
      Literature-based automated network reconstruction is still far from providing
      complete reconstructions of molecular networks. However, its value as an
      auxiliary tool is high and it will increase as standards for reporting biological
      entities and relationships become more widely accepted and enforced.
      Biblio-MetReS is an application that can be downloaded from
      http://metres.udl.cat/. It provides an easy to use environment for researchers to
      reconstruct their networks of interest from an always up to date set of
      scientific documents.

TI  - Identification of candidate genes in Arabidopsis and Populus cell wall
      biosynthesis using text-mining, co-expression network analysis and comparative
      genomics.
PG  - 675-87
LID - 10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.01.020 [doi]
AB  - Populus is an important bioenergy crop for bioethanol production. A greater
      understanding of cell wall biosynthesis processes is critical in reducing biomass
      recalcitrance, a major hindrance in efficient generation of biofuels from
      lignocellulosic biomass. Here, we report the identification of candidate cell
      wall biosynthesis genes through the development and application of a novel
      bioinformatics pipeline. As a first step, via text-mining of PubMed publications,
      we obtained 121 Arabidopsis genes that had the experimental evidence supporting
      their involvement in cell wall biosynthesis or remodeling. The 121 genes were
      then used as bait genes to query an Arabidopsis co-expression database, and
      additional genes were identified as neighbors of the bait genes in the network,
      increasing the number of genes to 548. The 548 Arabidopsis genes were then used
      to re-query the Arabidopsis co-expression database and re-construct a network
      that captured additional network neighbors, expanding to a total of 694 genes.
      The 694 Arabidopsis genes were computationally divided into 22 clusters. Queries 
      of the Populus genome using the Arabidopsis genes revealed 817 Populus orthologs.
      Functional analysis of gene ontology and tissue-specific gene expression
      indicated that these Arabidopsis and Populus genes are high likelihood candidates
      for functional characterization in relation to cell wall biosynthesis.

TI  - Identification of candidate genes related to bovine marbling using
      protein-protein interaction networks.
PG  - 992-1002
AB  - Complex traits are determined by the combined effects of many loci and are
      affected by gene networks or biological pathways. Systems biology approaches have
      an important role in the identification of candidate genes related to complex
      diseases or traits at the system level. The present study systemically analyzed
      genes associated with bovine marbling score and identified their relationships.
      The candidate nodes were obtained using MedScan text-mining tools and linked by
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) from the Human Protein Reference Database
      (HPRD). To determine key node of marbling, the degree and betweenness centrality 
      (BC) were used. The hub nodes and biological pathways of our network are
      consistent with the previous reports about marbling traits, and also suggest
      unknown candidate genes associated with intramuscular fat. Five nodes were
      identified as hub genes, which was consistent with the network analysis using
      quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Key nodes of the PPI network
      have positive roles (PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and RUNX1T1) and negative roles
      (RXRA, CAMK2A) in the development of intramuscular fat by several
      adipogenesis-related pathways. This study provides genetic information for
      identifying candidate genes for the marbling trait in bovine.

TI  - The protein interaction network mediated by human SH3 domains.
PG  - 4-15
LID - 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.06.012 [doi]
AB  - Families of conserved protein domains, specialized in mediating interactions with
      short linear peptide motifs, are responsible for the formation of a variety of
      dynamic complexes in the cell. An important subclass of these motifs are
      characterized by a high proline content and play a pivotal role in biological
      processes requiring the coordinated assembly of multi-protein complexes. This is 
      achieved via interaction of proteins containing modules such as Src Homology-3
      (SH3) or WW domains and specific proline rich patterns. Here we make available
      via a publicly accessible database a synopsis of our current understanding of the
      interaction landscape of the human SH3 protein family. This is achieved by
      integrating an information extraction strategy with a new experimental approach. 
      In a first approach we have used a text mining strategy to capture a large number
      of manuscripts reporting interactions between SH3 domains and target peptides.
      Relevant information was annotated in the MINT database. In a second experimental
      approach we have used a variant of the WISE (Whole Interactome Scanning
      Experiment) strategy to probe a large number of naturally occurring and
      chemically-synthesized peptides arrayed at high density on a glass surface. By
      this method we have tested 60 human SH3 domains for their ability to bind a
      collection of 9192 poly-proline containing peptides immobilized on a glass chip. 
      To evaluate the quality of the resulting interaction dataset, we retested some of
      the interactions on a smaller scale and performed a series of pull down
      experiments on native proteins. Peptide chips, pull down assays, SPOT synthesis
      and phage display experiments have allowed us to further characterize the
      specificity and promiscuity of proline-rich binding domains and to map their
      interaction network. Both the information captured from the literature and the
      interactions inferred from the peptide chip experiments were collected and stored
      in the PepspotDB (http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/PepspotDB/).

AB  - The network-based approach has been used to describe the relationship among genes
      and various phenotypes, producing a network describing complex biological
      relationships. Such networks can be constructed by aggregating previously
      reported associations in the literature from various databases. In this work, we 
      applied the network-based approach to investigate how different brain areas are
      associated to genetic disorders and genes. In particular, a tripartite network
      with genes, genetic diseases, and brain areas was constructed based on the
      associations among them reported in the literature through text mining. In the
      resulting network, a disproportionately large number of gene-disease and
      disease-brain associations were attributed to a small subset of genes, diseases, 
      and brain areas. Furthermore, a small number of brain areas were found to be
      associated with a large number of the same genes and diseases. These core brain
      regions encompassed the areas identified by the previous genome-wide association 
      studies, and suggest potential areas of focus in the future imaging genetics
      research. The approach outlined in this work demonstrates the utility of the
      network-based approach in studying genetic effects on the brain.

TI  - Integration and publication of heterogeneous text-mined relationships on the
      Semantic Web.
PG  - S10

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques enable the
      extraction of fine-grained relationships mentioned in biomedical text. The
      variability and the complexity of natural language in expressing similar
      relationships causes the extracted relationships to be highly heterogeneous,
      which makes the construction of knowledge bases difficult and poses a challenge
      in using these for data mining or question answering. RESULTS: We report on the
      semi-automatic construction of the PHARE relationship ontology (the
      PHArmacogenomic RElationships Ontology) consisting of 200 curated relations from 
      over 40,000 heterogeneous relationships extracted via text-mining. These
      heterogeneous relations are then mapped to the PHARE ontology using synonyms,
      entity descriptions and hierarchies of entities and roles. Once mapped,
      relationships can be normalized and compared using the structure of the ontology 
      to identify relationships that have similar semantics but different syntax. We
      compare and contrast the manual procedure with a fully automated approach using
      WordNet to quantify the degree of integration enabled by iterative curation and
      refinement of the PHARE ontology. The result of such integration is a repository 
      of normalized biomedical relationships, named PHARE-KB, which can be queried
      using Semantic Web technologies such as SPARQL and can be visualized in the form 
      of a biological network. CONCLUSIONS: The PHARE ontology serves as a common
      semantic framework to integrate more than 40,000 relationships pertinent to
      pharmacogenomics. The PHARE ontology forms the foundation of a knowledge base
      named PHARE-KB. Once populated with relationships, PHARE-KB (i) can be visualized
      in the form of a biological network to guide human tasks such as database
      curation and (ii) can be queried programmatically to guide bioinformatics
      applications such as the prediction of molecular interactions. PHARE is available
      at http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PHARE.

AB  - Providing prior knowledge about biological properties of chemicals, such as
      kinetic values, protein targets, or toxic effects, can facilitate many aspects of
      drug development. Chemical information is rapidly accumulating in all sorts of
      free text documents like patents, industry reports, or scientific articles, which
      has motivated the development of specifically tailored text mining applications. 
      Despite the potential gains, chemical text mining still faces significant
      challenges. One of the most salient is the recognition of chemical entities
      mentioned in text. To help practitioners contribute to this area, a good portion 
      of this review is devoted to this issue, and presents the basic concepts and
      principles underlying the main strategies. The technical details are introduced
      and accompanied by relevant bibliographic references. Other tasks discussed are
      retrieving relevant articles, identifying relationships between chemicals and
      other entities, or determining the chemical structures of chemicals mentioned in 
      text. This review also introduces a number of published applications that can be 
      used to build pipelines in topics like drug side effects, toxicity, and
      protein-disease-compound network analysis. We conclude the review with an outlook
      on how we expect the field to evolve, discussing its possibilities and its
      current limitations.

TI  - Building the process-drug-side effect network to discover the relationship
      between biological processes and side effects.
PG  - S2
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-S2-S2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Side effects are unwanted responses to drug treatment and are
      important resources for human phenotype information. The recent development of a 
      database on side effects, the side effect resource (SIDER), is a first step in
      documenting the relationship between drugs and their side effects. It is,
      however, insufficient to simply find the association of drugs with biological
      processes; that relationship is crucial because drugs that influence biological
      processes can have an impact on phenotype. Therefore, knowing which processes
      respond to drugs that influence the phenotype will enable more effective and
      systematic study of the effect of drugs on phenotype. To the best of our
      knowledge, the relationship between biological processes and side effects of
      drugs has not yet been systematically researched. METHODS: We propose 3 steps for
      systematically searching relationships between drugs and biological processes:
      enrichment scores (ES) calculations, t-score calculation, and threshold-based
      filtering. Subsequently, the side effect-related biological processes are found
      by merging the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. 
      Evaluation is conducted in 2 ways: first, by discerning the number of biological 
      processes discovered by our method that co-occur with Gene Ontology (GO) terms in
      relation to effects extracted from PubMed records using a text-mining technique
      and second, determining whether there is improvement in performance by limiting
      response processes by drugs sharing the same side effect to frequent ones alone. 
      RESULTS: The multi-level network (the process-drug-side effect network) was built
      by merging the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. 
      We generated a network of 74 drugs-168 side effects-2209 biological process
      relation resources. The preliminary results showed that the process-drug-side
      effect network was able to find meaningful relationships between biological
      processes and side effects in an efficient manner. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a
      novel process-drug-side effect network for discovering the relationship between
      biological processes and side effects. By exploring the relationship between
      drugs and phenotypes through a multi-level network, the mechanisms underlying the
      effect of specific drugs on the human body may be understood.

TI  - Immunological network signatures of cancer progression and survival.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/1755-8794-4-28 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The immune contribution to cancer progression is complex and
      difficult to characterize. For example in tumors, immune gene expression is
      detected from the combination of normal, tumor and immune cells in the tumor
      microenvironment. Profiling the immune component of tumors may facilitate the
      characterization of the poorly understood roles immunity plays in cancer
      progression. However, the current approaches to analyze the immune component of a
      tumor rely on incomplete identification of immune factors. METHODS: To facilitate
      a more comprehensive approach, we created a ranked immunological relevance score 
      for all human genes, developed using a novel strategy that combines text mining
      and information theory. We used this score to assign an immunological grade to
      gene expression profiles, and thereby quantify the immunological component of
      tumors. This immunological relevance score was benchmarked against existing
      manually curated immune resources as well as high-throughput studies. To further 
      characterize immunological relevance for genes, the relevance score was charted
      against both the human interactome and cancer information, forming an expanded
      interactome landscape of tumor immunity. We applied this approach to expression
      profiles in melanomas, thus identifying and grading their immunological
      components, followed by identification of their associated protein interactions. 
      RESULTS: The power of this strategy was demonstrated by the observation of early 
      activation of the adaptive immune response and the diversity of the immune
      component during melanoma progression. Furthermore, the genome-wide immunological
      relevance score classified melanoma patient groups, whose immunological grade
      correlated with clinical features, such as immune phenotypes and survival.
      CONCLUSIONS: The assignment of a ranked immunological relevance score to all
      human genes extends the content of existing immune gene resources and enriches
      our understanding of immune involvement in complex biological networks. The
      application of this approach to tumor immunity represents an automated systems
      strategy that quantifies the immunological component in complex disease. In so
      doing, it stratifies patients according to their immune profiles, which may lead 
      to effective computational prognostic and clinical guides.

PG  - 16332-43
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.216986 [doi]
AB  - Starvation elicits a complex adaptive response in an organism. No information on 
      transcriptional regulation of metabolic adaptations is available. We, therefore, 
      studied the gene expression profiles of brain, small intestine, kidney, liver,
      and skeletal muscle in mice that were subjected to 0-72 h of fasting.
      Functional-category enrichment, text mining, and network analyses were employed
      to scrutinize the overall adaptation, aiming to identify responsive pathways,
      processes, and networks, and their regulation. The observed transcriptomics
      response did not follow the accepted "carbohydrate-lipid-protein" succession of
      expenditure of energy substrates. Instead, these processes were activated
      simultaneously in different organs during the entire period. The most prominent
      changes occurred in lipid and steroid metabolism, especially in the liver and
      kidney. They were accompanied by suppression of the immune response and cell
      turnover, particularly in the small intestine, and by increased proteolysis in
      the muscle. The brain was extremely well protected from the sequels of
      starvation. 60% of the identified overconnected transcription factors were
      organ-specific, 6% were common for 4 organs, with nuclear receptors as
      protagonists, accounting for almost 40% of all transcriptional regulators during 
      fasting. The common transcription factors were PPARalpha, HNF4alpha, GCRalpha, AR
      (androgen receptor), SREBP1 and -2, FOXOs, EGR1, c-JUN, c-MYC, SP1, YY1, and
      ETS1. Our data strongly suggest that the control of metabolism in four
      metabolically active organs is exerted by transcription factors that are
      activated by nutrient signals and serves, at least partly, to prevent
      irreversible brain damage.

TI  - Using ontology network structure in text mining.
PG  - 41-5
AB  - Statistical text mining treats documents as bags of words, with a focus on term
      frequencies within documents and across document collections. Unlike natural
      language processing (NLP) techniques that rely on an engineered vocabulary or a
      full-featured ontology, statistical approaches do not make use of domain-specific
      knowledge. The freedom from biases can be an advantage, but at the cost of
      ignoring potentially valuable knowledge. The approach proposed here investigates 
      a hybrid strategy based on computing graph measures of term importance over an
      entire ontology and injecting the measures into the statistical text mining
      process. As a starting point, we adapt existing search engine algorithms such as 
      PageRank and HITS to determine term importance within an ontology graph. The
      graph-theoretic approach is evaluated using a smoking data set from the i2b2
      National Center for Biomedical Computing, cast as a simple binary classification 
      task for categorizing smoking-related documents, demonstrating consistent
      improvements in accuracy.

TI  - Bioinformatics-driven identification and examination of candidate genes for
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - e16542
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0016542 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Candidate genes for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
      identified by a bioinformatics approach were examined for variant associations to
      quantitative traits of NAFLD-related phenotypes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: By 
      integrating public database text mining, trans-organism protein-protein
      interaction transferal, and information on liver protein expression a
      protein-protein interaction network was constructed and from this a smaller
      isolated interactome was identified. Five genes from this interactome were
      selected for genetic analysis. Twenty-one tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) which captured all common variation in these genes were genotyped in
      10,196 Danes, and analyzed for association with NAFLD-related quantitative
      traits, type 2 diabetes (T2D), central obesity, and WHO-defined metabolic
      syndrome (MetS). RESULTS: 273 genes were included in the protein-protein
      interaction analysis and EHHADH, ECHS1, HADHA, HADHB, and ACADL were selected for
      further examination. A total of 10 nominal statistical significant associations
      (P<0.05) to quantitative metabolic traits were identified. Also, the case-control
      study showed associations between variation in the five genes and T2D, central
      obesity, and MetS, respectively. Bonferroni adjustments for multiple testing
      negated all associations. CONCLUSIONS: Using a bioinformatics approach we
      identified five candidate genes for NAFLD. However, we failed to provide evidence
      of associations with major effects between SNPs in these five genes and
      NAFLD-related quantitative traits, T2D, central obesity, and MetS.

TI  - Genes and regulatory networks involved in persistence of Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 300-10
LID - 10.1007/s11427-011-4134-5 [doi]
AB  - The causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the
      most successful of human pathogens. It can evade the host immune response and
      establish a persistent infection or enter a dormant state within the host which
      can be reactivated if the host becomes immuno-compromised. Both of these features
      are major obstacles to tuberculosis eradication. Dormancy and reactivation of M. 
      tuberculosis are tightly coordinated dynamic processes involving numerous genes
      and their products. Molecular mechanisms underlying M. tuberculosis persistence
      may provide an opportunity for the discovery of effective drug targets for
      tuberculosis control. Here, we review the genes required for M. tuberculosis
      persistence and propose a regulatory network for the action of these genes using 
      text mining. This should provide fresh insights into the persistence mechanisms
      of M. tuberculosis and suggest candidates for new drug targets and immune
      intervention.

TI  - Quantitative proteomic analysis of S-nitrosated proteins in diabetic mouse liver 
      with ICAT switch method.
PG  - 675-87
LID - 10.1007/s13238-010-0087-x [doi]
AB  - In this study we developed a quantitative proteomic method named ICAT switch by
      introducing isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagents into the biotin-switch
      method, and used it to investigate S-nitrosation in the liver of normal control
      C57BL/6J mice and type 2 diabetic KK-Ay mice. We got fifty-eight S-nitrosated
      peptides with quantitative information in our research, among which thirty-seven 
      had changed S-nitrosation levels in diabetic mouse liver. The S-nitrosated
      peptides belonged to forty-eight proteins (twenty-eight were new S-nitrosated
      proteins), some of which were new targets of S-nitrosation and known to be
      related with diabetes. S-nitrosation patterns were different between diabetic and
      normal mice. Gene ontology enrichment results suggested that S-nitrosated
      proteins are more abundant in amino acid metabolic processes. The network
      constructed for S-nitrosated proteins by text-mining technology provided clues
      about the relationship between S-nitrosation and type 2 diabetes. Our work
      provides a new approach for quantifying S-nitrosated proteins and suggests that
      the integrative functions of S-nitrosation may take part in pathophysiological
      processes of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Combining network modeling and gene expression microarray analysis to explore the
      dynamics of Th1 and Th2 cell regulation.
PG  - e1001032
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001032 [doi]
AB  - Two T helper (Th) cell subsets, namely Th1 and Th2 cells, play an important role 
      in inflammatory diseases. The two subsets are thought to counter-regulate each
      other, and alterations in their balance result in different diseases. This
      paradigm has been challenged by recent clinical and experimental data. Because of
      the large number of genes involved in regulating Th1 and Th2 cells, assessment of
      this paradigm by modeling or experiments is difficult. Novel algorithms based on 
      formal methods now permit the analysis of large gene regulatory networks. By
      combining these algorithms with in silico knockouts and gene expression
      microarray data from human T cells, we examined if the results were compatible
      with a counter-regulatory role of Th1 and Th2 cells. We constructed a directed
      network model of genes regulating Th1 and Th2 cells through text mining and
      manual curation. We identified four attractors in the network, three of which
      included genes that corresponded to Th0, Th1 and Th2 cells. The fourth attractor 
      contained a mixture of Th1 and Th2 genes. We found that neither in silico
      knockouts of the Th1 and Th2 attractor genes nor gene expression microarray data 
      from patients with immunological disorders and healthy subjects supported a
      counter-regulatory role of Th1 and Th2 cells. By combining network modeling with 
      transcriptomic data analysis and in silico knockouts, we have devised a practical
      way to help unravel complex regulatory network topology and to increase our
      understanding of how network actions may differ in health and disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding cellular systems requires the knowledge of a protein's 
      subcellular localization (SCL). Although experimental and predicted data for
      protein SCL are archived in various databases, SCL prediction remains a
      non-trivial problem in genome annotation. Current SCL prediction tools use
      amino-acid sequence features and text mining approaches. A comprehensive analysis
      of protein SCL in human PPI and metabolic networks for various subcellular
      compartments is necessary for developing a robust SCL prediction methodology.
      RESULTS: Based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) and metabolite-linked protein
      interaction (MLPI) networks of proteins, we have compared, contrasted and
      analysed the statistical properties across different subcellular compartments. We
      integrated PPI and metabolic datasets with SCL information of human proteins from
      LOCATE and GOA (Gene Ontology Annotation) and estimated three statistical
      properties: Chi-square (chi2) test, Paired Localisation Correlation Profile
      (PLCP) and network topological measures. For the PPI network, Pearson's
      chi-square test shows that for the same SCL category, twice as many interacting
      protein pairs are observed than estimated when compared to non-interacting
      protein pairs (chi2 = 1270.19, P-value < 2.2 x 10(-16)), whereas for MLPI,
      metabolite-linked protein pairs having the same SCL are observed 20% more than
      expected, compared to non-metabolite linked proteins (chi2 = 110.02, P-value <
      2.2 x10(-16)). To address the issue of proteins with multiple SCLs, we have
      specifically used the PLCP (Pair Localization Correlation Profile) measure. PLCP 
      analysis revealed that protein interactions are majorly restricted to the same
      SCL, though significant cross-compartment interactions are seen for nuclear
      proteins. Metabolite-linked protein pairs are restricted to specific compartments
      such as the mitochondrion (P-value < 6.0e-07), the lysosome (P-value < 4.7e-05)
      and the Golgi apparatus (P-value < 1.0e-15). These findings indicate that the
      metabolic network adds value to the information in the PPI network for the
      localisation process of proteins in human subcellular compartments. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The MLPI network differs significantly from the PPI network in its SCL
      distribution. The PPI network shows passive protein interaction, possibly due to 
      its high false positive rate, across different subcellular compartments, which
      seem to be absent in the MLPI network, as the MLPI network has evolved to
      maintain high substrate specificity for proteins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have clearly validated the association
      between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      Patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of HCC, in particular
      those with active liver disease and cirrhosis. METHODS: We catalogued all
      published interactions between HBV and human proteins, identifying 250
      descriptions of HBV and human protein interactions and 146 unique human proteins 
      that interact with HBV proteins by text mining. RESULTS: Integration of this data
      set into a reconstructed human interactome showed that cellular proteins
      interacting with HBV are made up of core proteins that are interconnected with
      many pathways. A global analysis based on functional annotation highlighted the
      enrichment of cellular pathways targeted by HBV. CONCLUSIONS: By connecting the
      cellular proteins targeted by HBV, we have constructed a central network of
      proteins associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, which might be to regard as
      the basis of a detailed map for tracking new cellular interactions, and guiding
      future investigations.

AB  - Detailed investigation of socially important diseases with modern experimental
      methods has resulted in the generation of large volume of valuable data. However,
      analysis and interpretation of this data needs application of efficient
      computational techniques and systems biology approaches. In particular, the
      techniques allowing the reconstruction of associative networks of various
      biological objects and events can be useful. In this publication, the combination
      of different techniques to create such a network associated with an abstract cell
      environment is discussed in order to gain insights into the functional as well as
      spatial interrelationships. It is shown that experimentally gained knowledge
      enriched with data warehouse content and text mining data can be used for the
      reconstruction and localization of a cardiovascular disease developing network
      beginning with MUPP1/MPDZ (multi-PDZ domain protein).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many essential cellular processes, such as cellular metabolism,
      transport, cellular metabolism and most regulatory mechanisms, rely on physical
      interactions between proteins. Genome-wide protein interactome networks of yeast,
      human and several other animal organisms have already been established, but this 
      kind of network reminds to be established in the field of plant. RESULTS: We
      first predicted the protein protein interaction in Arabidopsis thaliana with
      methods, including ortholog, SSBP, gene fusion, gene neighbor, phylogenetic
      profile, coexpression, protein domain, and used Naive Bayesian approach next to
      integrate the results of these methods and text mining data to build a
      genome-wide protein interactome network. Furthermore, we adopted the data of GO
      enrichment analysis, pathway, published literature to validate our network, the
      confirmation of our network shows the feasibility of using our network to predict
      protein function and other usage. CONCLUSIONS: Our interactome is a comprehensive
      genome-wide network in the organism plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and provides a
      rich resource for researchers in related field to study the protein function,
      molecular interaction and potential mechanism under different conditions.

TI  - AtPID: the overall hierarchical functional protein interaction network interface 
      and analytic platform for Arabidopsis.
PG  - D1130-3
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq959 [doi]
AB  - Protein interactions are involved in important cellular functions and biological 
      processes that are the fundamentals of all life activities. With improvements in 
      experimental techniques and progress in research, the overall protein interaction
      network frameworks of several model organisms have been created through data
      collection and integration. However, most of the networks processed only show
      simple relationships without boundary, weight or direction, which do not truly
      reflect the biological reality. In vivo, different types of protein interactions,
      such as the assembly of protein complexes or phosphorylation, often have their
      specific functions and qualifications. Ignorance of these features will bring
      much bias to the network analysis and application. Therefore, we annotate the
      Arabidopsis proteins in the AtPID database with further information (e.g.
      functional annotation, subcellular localization, tissue-specific expression,
      phosphorylation information, SNP phenotype and mutant phenotype, etc.) and
      interaction qualifications (e.g. transcriptional regulation, complex assembly,
      functional collaboration, etc.) via further literature text mining and
      integration of other resources. Meanwhile, the related information is vividly
      displayed to users through a comprehensive and newly developed display and
      analytical tools. The system allows the construction of tissue-specific
      interaction networks with display of canonical pathways. The latest updated AtPID
      database is available at http://www.megabionet.org/atpid/.

TI  - The BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO): the first all-integrating ontology of all
      organisms for enzyme sources.
PG  - D507-13
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq968 [doi]
AB  - BTO, the BRENDA Tissue Ontology (http://www.BTO.brenda-enzymes.org) represents a 
      comprehensive structured encyclopedia of tissue terms. The project started in
      2003 to create a connection between the enzyme data collection of the BRENDA
      enzyme database and a structured network of source tissues and cell types.
      Currently, BTO contains more than 4600 different anatomical structures, tissues, 
      cell types and cell lines, classified under generic categories corresponding to
      the rules and formats of the Gene Ontology Consortium and organized as a directed
      acyclic graph (DAG). Most of the terms are endowed with comments on their
      derivation or definitions. The content of the ontology is constantly curated with
      approximately 1000 new terms each year. Four different types of relationships
      between the terms are implemented. A versatile web interface with several search 
      and navigation functionalities allows convenient online access to the BTO and to 
      the enzymes isolated from the tissues. Important areas of applications of the BTO
      terms are the detection of enzymes in tissues and the provision of a solid basis 
      for text-mining approaches in this field. It is widely used by lab scientists,
      curators of genomic and biochemical databases and bioinformaticians. The BTO is
      freely available at http://www.obofoundry.org.

      oncogenic targets in human glioma cells.
PG  - 27-37
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.10.032 [doi]
AB  - Malignant gliomas are the most common type of intrinsic central nervous system
      (CNS) tumors with high mortality and morbidity. beta-catenin is overexpressed in 
      human glioblastoma and knockdown of beta-catenin inhibits glioblastoma cell
      proliferation and invasive ability, and induces apoptotic cell death.
      Furthermore, treating the nude mice carrying established subcutaneous LN229
      gliomas with siRNA targeting beta-catenin intratumorally also delayed the tumor
      growth. However, the mechanisms of down-regulation of beta-catenin that represses
      glioblastoma malignancy behavior remain to be elucidated. We utilized text-mining
      of MEDLINE abstracts with natural language processing to establish the
      beta-catenin biologic association network, and identified several interactions of
      this network with the EGFR pathway. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, our
      results confirmed down-regulation of beta-catenin induced reduced expression of
      EGFR, STAT3 and AKT1 mRNA and protein, besides, the level of phosphorylated Akt
      also decreased. A similar reduction in expression of CyclinD1, MMP2 and MMP9,
      downstream genes of the EGFR pathway, was observed. These results suggest that
      the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulates glioma cell proliferation and invasion, in
      part via the EGFR pathway.

TI  - ReCGiP, a database of reproduction candidate genes in pigs based on bibliomics.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/1477-7827-8-96 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reproduction in pigs is one of the most economically important
      traits. To improve the reproductive performances, numerous studies have focused
      on the identification of candidate genes. However, it is hard for one to read all
      literatures thoroughly to get information. So we have developed a database
      providing candidate genes for reproductive researches in pig by mining and
      processing existing biological literatures in human and pigs, named as ReCGiP.
      DESCRIPTION: Based on text-mining and comparative genomics, ReCGiP presents
      diverse information of reproduction-relevant genes in human and pig. The genes
      were sorted by the degree of relevance with the reproduction topics and were
      visualized in a gene's co-occurrence network where two genes were connected if
      they were co-cited in a PubMed abstract. The 'hub' genes which had more
      'neighbors' were thought to be have more important functions and could be
      identified by the user in their web browser. In addition, ReCGiP provided
      integrated GO annotation, OMIM and biological pathway information collected from 
      the Internet. Both pig and human gene information can be found in the database,
      which is now available. CONCLUSIONS: ReCGiP is a unique database providing
      information on reproduction related genes for pig. It can be used in the area of 
      the molecular genetics, the genetic linkage map, and the breeding of the pig and 
      other livestock. Moreover, it can be used as a reference for human reproduction
      research.

TI  - Discovery of drug mode of action and drug repositioning from transcriptional
      responses.
PG  - 14621-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1000138107 [doi]
AB  - A bottleneck in drug discovery is the identification of the molecular targets of 
      a compound (mode of action, MoA) and of its off-target effects. Previous
      approaches to elucidate drug MoA include analysis of chemical structures,
      transcriptional responses following treatment, and text mining. Methods based on 
      transcriptional responses require the least amount of information and can be
      quickly applied to new compounds. Available methods are inefficient and are not
      able to support network pharmacology. We developed an automatic and robust
      approach that exploits similarity in gene expression profiles following drug
      treatment, across multiple cell lines and dosages, to predict similarities in
      drug effect and MoA. We constructed a "drug network" of 1,302 nodes (drugs) and
      41,047 edges (indicating similarities between pair of drugs). We applied network 
      theory, partitioning drugs into groups of densely interconnected nodes (i.e.,
      communities). These communities are significantly enriched for compounds with
      similar MoA, or acting on the same pathway, and can be used to identify the
      compound-targeted biological pathways. New compounds can be integrated into the
      network to predict their therapeutic and off-target effects. Using this network, 
      we correctly predicted the MoA for nine anticancer compounds, and we were able to
      discover an unreported effect for a well-known drug. We verified an unexpected
      similarity between cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitors and Topoisomerase
      inhibitors. We discovered that Fasudil (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) might be
      "repositioned" as an enhancer of cellular autophagy, potentially applicable to
      several neurodegenerative disorders. Our approach was implemented in a tool (Mode
      of Action by NeTwoRk Analysis, MANTRA, http://mantra.tigem.it).

AB  - We participated (as Team 9) in the Article Classification Task of the Biocreative
      II.5 Challenge: binary classification of full-text documents relevant for
      protein-protein interaction. We used two distinct classifiers for the online and 
      offline challenges: 1) the lightweight Variable Trigonometric Threshold (VTT)
      linear classifier we successfully introduced in BioCreative 2 for binary
      classification of abstracts and 2) a novel Naive Bayes classifier using features 
      from the citation network of the relevant literature. We supplemented the
      supplied training data with full-text documents from the MIPS database. The
      lightweight VTT classifier was very competitive in this new full-text scenario:
      it was a top-performing submission in this task, taking into account the rank
      product of the Area Under the interpolated precision and recall Curve, Accuracy, 
      Balanced F-Score, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient performance measures. The
      novel citation network classifier for the biomedical text mining domain, while
      not a top performing classifier in the challenge, performed above the central
      tendency of all submissions, and therefore indicates a promising new avenue to
      investigate further in bibliome informatics.

PG  - 596-615
LID - 10.3390/ijerph7020596 [doi]
AB  - Text and structural data mining of web and social media (WSM) provides a novel
      disease surveillance resource and can identify online communities for targeted
      public health communications (PHC) to assure wide dissemination of pertinent
      information. WSM that mention influenza are harvested over a 24-week period, 5
      October 2008 to 21 March 2009. Link analysis reveals communities for targeted
      PHC. Text mining is shown to identify trends in flu posts that correlate to
      real-world influenza-like illness patient report data. We also bring to bear a
      graph-based data mining technique to detect anomalies among flu blogs connected
      by publisher type, links, and user-tags.

TI  - Event extraction for systems biology by text mining the literature.
PG  - 381-90
LID - 10.1016/j.tibtech.2010.04.005 [doi]
AB  - Systems biology recognizes in particular the importance of interactions between
      biological components and the consequences of these interactions. Such
      interactions and their downstream effects are known as events. To computationally
      mine the literature for such events, text mining methods that can detect, extract
      and annotate them are required. This review summarizes the methods that are
      currently available, with a specific focus on protein-protein interactions and
      pathway or network reconstruction. The approaches described will be of
      considerable value in associating particular pathways and their components with
      higher-order physiological properties, including disease states.

TI  - An in silico analysis of microRNAs: mining the miRNAome.
PG  - 1853-62
LID - 10.1039/c003961f [doi]
AB  - Systematic analysis of literature- and experimentally-derived datasets using text
      mining with ontological enrichment and network modeling revealed global trends in
      the microRNA (miRNA) interactome. A total of 756 unique miRNAs were resolved from
      PubMed abstracts and 1165 direct relationships between 270 miRNAs and 581 genes
      were identified as phrase groups using semantic search techniques. These
      miRNA:gene interactions were built into a bipartite network (the miRNAome) which 
      displays scale-free degree distribution. Functional classification of
      miRNA-target genes using PANTHER revealed 189 distinct molecular functions, with 
      significant enrichment of nucleic acid binding, transcription and protein
      phosphorylation. Pathway analysis revealed a network of 176 miRNAs linked to 368 
      OMIM disorders via their target genes, which are enriched (p = 0.0047) for
      disease-associated SNP variations. Reference to a database of drug targets
      revealed that 24.8% of all published miRNA-targets are targets for drug
      development programs, while a sub-set (18.2%) are targets for FDA-approved drugs.
      Consistent with topological analysis of the miRNA-disease network, the most
      prevalent class of FDA-approved drugs is anti-neoplastic agents against published
      miRNA-target genes. Linking miRNAs to biological process and diseases reveals
      distinct co-regulation of phenotypes that could aid in understanding the role
      miRNA-based gene regulation plays in biological phenomena.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Metabolic and signaling pathways are an increasingly important part
      of organizing knowledge in systems biology. They serve to integrate collective
      interpretations of facts scattered throughout literature. Biologists construct a 
      pathway by reading a large number of articles and interpreting them as a
      consistent network, but most of the models constructed currently lack direct
      links to those articles. Biologists who want to check the original articles have 
      to spend substantial amounts of time to collect relevant articles and identify
      the sections relevant to the pathway. Furthermore, with the scientific literature
      expanding by several thousand papers per week, keeping a model relevant requires 
      a continuous curation effort. In this article, we present a system designed to
      integrate a pathway visualizer, text mining systems and annotation tools into a
      seamless environment. This will enable biologists to freely move between parts of
      a pathway and relevant sections of articles, as well as identify relevant papers 
      from large text bases. The system, PathText, is developed by Systems Biology
      Institute, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, National Centre for Text 
      Mining (University of Manchester) and the University of Tokyo, and is being used 
      by groups of biologists from these locations.

AB  - MAGIA (miRNA and genes integrated analysis) is a novel web tool for the
      integrative analysis of target predictions, miRNA and gene expression data. MAGIA
      is divided into two parts: the query section allows the user to retrieve and
      browse updated miRNA target predictions computed with a number of different
      algorithms (PITA, miRanda and Target Scan) and Boolean combinations thereof. The 
      analysis section comprises a multistep procedure for (i) direct integration
      through different functional measures (parametric and non-parametric correlation 
      indexes, a variational Bayesian model, mutual information and a meta-analysis
      approach based on P-value combination) of mRNA and miRNA expression data, (ii)
      construction of bipartite regulatory network of the best miRNA and mRNA putative 
      interactions and (iii) retrieval of information available in several public
      databases of genes, miRNAs and diseases and via scientific literature
      text-mining. MAGIA is freely available for Academic users at
      http://gencomp.bio.unipd.it/magia.

AB  - The authors report on the development of the Cancer Tissue Information Extraction
      System (caTIES)--an application that supports collaborative tissue banking and
      text mining by leveraging existing natural language processing methods and
      algorithms, grid communication and security frameworks, and query visualization
      methods. The system fills an important need for text-derived clinical data in
      translational research such as tissue-banking and clinical trials. The design of 
      caTIES addresses three critical issues for informatics support of translational
      research: (1) federation of research data sources derived from clinical systems; 
      (2) expressive graphical interfaces for concept-based text mining; and (3)
      regulatory and security model for supporting multi-center collaborative research.
      Implementation of the system at several Cancer Centers across the country is
      creating a potential network of caTIES repositories that could provide millions
      of de-identified clinical reports to users. The system provides an end-to-end
      application of medical natural language processing to support multi-institutional
      translational research programs.

TI  - Prediction of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin target proteins by identifying
      reversibly oxidized cysteinyl residues.
LID - 10.2390/biecoll-jib-2010-130 [doi]
AB  - A significant part of cellular proteins undergo reversible thiol-dependent redox 
      transitions which often control or switch protein functions. Thioredoxins and
      glutaredoxins constitute two key players in this redox regulatory protein
      network. Both interact with various categories of proteins containing reversibly 
      oxidized cysteinyl residues. The identification of thioredoxin/glutaredoxin
      target proteins is a critical step in constructing the redox regulatory network
      of cells or subcellular compartments. Due to the scarcity of
      thioredoxin/glutaredoxin target protein records in the public database, a tool
      called Reversibly Oxidized Cysteine Detector (ROCD) is implemented here to
      identify potential thioredoxin/glutaredoxin target proteins computationally, so
      that the in silico construction of redox regulatory network may become feasible. 
      ROCD was tested on 46 thioredoxin target proteins in plant mitochondrion, and the
      recall rate was 66.7% when 50% sequence identity was chosen for structural model 
      selection. ROCD will be used to predict the thioredoxin/glutaredoxin target
      proteins in human liver mitochondrion for our redox regulatory network
      construction project. The ROCD will be developed further to provide prediction
      with more reliability and incorporated into biological network visualization
      tools as a node prediction component. This work will advance the capability of
      traditional database- or text mining-based method in the network construction.

TI  - LAITOR--Literature Assistant for Identification of Terms co-Occurrences and
      Relationships.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-11-70 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological knowledge is represented in scientific literature that
      often describes the function of genes/proteins (bioentities) in terms of their
      interactions (biointeractions). Such bioentities are often related to biological 
      concepts of interest that are specific of a determined research field. Therefore,
      the study of the current literature about a selected topic deposited in public
      databases, facilitates the generation of novel hypotheses associating a set of
      bioentities to a common context. RESULTS: We created a text mining system
      (LAITOR: Literature Assistant for Identification of Terms co-Occurrences and
      Relationships) that analyses co-occurrences of bioentities, biointeractions, and 
      other biological terms in MEDLINE abstracts. The method accounts for the position
      of the co-occurring terms within sentences or abstracts. The system detected
      abstracts mentioning protein-protein interactions in a standard test (BioCreative
      II IAS test data) with a precision of 0.82-0.89 and a recall of 0.48-0.70. We
      illustrate the application of LAITOR to the detection of plant response genes in 
      a dataset of 1000 abstracts relevant to the topic. CONCLUSIONS: Text mining tools
      combining the extraction of interacting bioentities and biological concepts with 
      network displays can be helpful in developing reasonable hypotheses in different 
      scientific backgrounds.

TI  - Improving the prediction of pharmacogenes using text-derived drug-gene
      relationships.
PG  - 305-14
AB  - A critical goal of pharmacogenomics research is to identify genes that can
      explain variation in drug response. We have previously reported a method that
      creates a genome-scale ranking of genes likely to interact with a drug. The
      algorithm uses information about drug structure and indications of use to rank
      the genes. Although the algorithm has good performance, its performance depends
      on a curated set of drug-gene relationships that is expensive to create and
      difficult to maintain. In this work, we assess the utility of text mining in
      extracting a network of drug-gene relationships automatically. This provides a
      valuable aggregate source of knowledge, subsequently used as input into the
      algorithm that ranks potential pharmacogenes. Using a drug-gene network created
      from sentence-level co-occurrence in the full text of scientific articles, we
      compared the performance to that of a network created by manual curation of those
      articles. Under a wide range of conditions, we show that a knowledge base derived
      from text-mining the literature performs as well as, and sometimes better than, a
      high-quality, manually curated knowledge base. We conclude that we can use
      relationships mined automatically from the literature as a knowledgebase for
      pharmacogenomics relationships. Additionally, when relationships are missed by
      text mining, our system can accurately extrapolate new relationships with 77.4%
      precision.

TI  - HLungDB: an integrated database of human lung cancer research.
PG  - D665-9
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkp945 [doi]
AB  - The human lung cancer database (HLungDB) is a database with the integration of
      the lung cancer-related genes, proteins and miRNAs together with the
      corresponding clinical information. The main purpose of this platform is to
      establish a network of lung cancer-related molecules and to facilitate the
      mechanistic study of lung carcinogenesis. The entries describing the
      relationships between molecules and human lung cancer in the current release were
      extracted manually from literatures. Currently, we have collected 2585 genes and 
      212 miRNA with the experimental evidences involved in the different stages of
      lung carcinogenesis through text mining. Furthermore, we have incorporated the
      results from analysis of transcription factor-binding motifs, the promoters and
      the SNP sites for each gene. Since epigenetic alterations also play an important 
      role in lung carcinogenesis, genes with epigenetic regulation were also included.
      We hope HLungDB will enrich our knowledge about lung cancer biology and
      eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. HLungDB can
      be freely accessed at http://www.megabionet.org/bio/hlung.

TI  - Pathway enrichment based on text mining and its validation on carotenoid and
      vitamin A metabolism.
PG  - 367-79
LID - 10.1089/omi.2009.0029 [doi]
AB  - Carotenoid metabolism is relevant to the prevention of various diseases. Although
      the main actors in this metabolic pathway are known, our understanding of the
      pathway is still incomplete. The information on the carotenoids is scattered in
      the large and growing body of scientific literature. We designed a text-mining
      work flow to enrich existing pathways. It has been validated on the vitamin A
      pathway, which is a well-studied part of the carotenoid metabolism. In this study
      we used the vitamin A metabolism pathway as it has been described by an expert
      team on carotenoid metabolism from the European network of excellence in
      Nutrigenomics (NuGO). This work flow uses an initial set of publications cited in
      a review paper (1,191 publications), enlarges this corpus with Medline abstracts 
      (13,579 documents), and then extracts the key terminology from all relevant
      publications. Domain experts validated the intermediate and final results of our 
      text-mining work flow. With our approach we were able to enrich the pathway
      representing vitamin A metabolism. We found 37 new and relevant terms from a
      total of 89,086 terms, which have been qualified for inclusion in the analyzed
      pathway. These 37 terms have been assessed manually and as a result 13 new terms 
      were then added as entities to the pathway. Another 14 entities belonged to other
      pathways, which could form the link of these pathways with the vitamin A pathway.
      The remaining 10 terms were classified as biomarkers or nutrients. Automatic
      literature analysis improves the enrichment of pathways with entities already
      described in the scientific literature.

TI  - Co-authorship network analysis: a powerful tool for strategic planning of
      research, development and capacity building programs on neglected diseases.
PG  - e501
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New approaches and tools were needed to support the strategic
      planning, implementation and management of a Program launched by the Brazilian
      Government to fund research, development and capacity building on neglected
      tropical diseases with strong focus on the North, Northeast and Center-West
      regions of the country where these diseases are prevalent. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: Based on demographic, epidemiological and burden of disease data, seven
      diseases were selected by the Ministry of Health as targets of the initiative.
      Publications on these diseases by Brazilian researchers were retrieved from
      international databases, analyzed and processed with text-mining tools in order
      to standardize author- and institution's names and addresses. Co-authorship
      networks based on these publications were assembled, visualized and analyzed with
      social network analysis software packages. Network visualization and analysis
      generated new information, allowing better design and strategic planning of the
      Program, enabling decision makers to characterize network components by area of
      work, identify institutions as well as authors playing major roles as central
      hubs or located at critical network cut-points and readily detect authors or
      institutions participating in large international scientific collaborating
      networks. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Traditional criteria used to monitor and
      evaluate research proposals or R&D Programs, such as researchers' productivity
      and impact factor of scientific publications, are of limited value when
      addressing research areas of low productivity or involving institutions from
      endemic regions where human resources are limited. Network analysis was found to 
      generate new and valuable information relevant to the strategic planning,
      implementation and monitoring of the Program. It afforded a more proactive role
      of the funding agencies in relation to public health and equity goals, to
      scientific capacity building objectives and a more consistent engagement of
      institutions and authors from endemic regions based on innovative criteria and
      parameters anchored on objective scientific data.

TI  - Large scale application of neural network based semantic role labeling for
      automated relation extraction from biomedical texts.
PG  - e6393
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0006393 [doi]
AB  - To reduce the increasing amount of time spent on literature search in the life
      sciences, several methods for automated knowledge extraction have been developed.
      Co-occurrence based approaches can deal with large text corpora like MEDLINE in
      an acceptable time but are not able to extract any specific type of semantic
      relation. Semantic relation extraction methods based on syntax trees, on the
      other hand, are computationally expensive and the interpretation of the generated
      trees is difficult. Several natural language processing (NLP) approaches for the 
      biomedical domain exist focusing specifically on the detection of a limited set
      of relation types. For systems biology, generic approaches for the detection of a
      multitude of relation types which in addition are able to process large text
      corpora are needed but the number of systems meeting both requirements is very
      limited. We introduce the use of SENNA ("Semantic Extraction using a Neural
      Network Architecture"), a fast and accurate neural network based Semantic Role
      Labeling (SRL) program, for the large scale extraction of semantic relations from
      the biomedical literature. A comparison of processing times of SENNA and other
      SRL systems or syntactical parsers used in the biomedical domain revealed that
      SENNA is the fastest Proposition Bank (PropBank) conforming SRL program currently
      available. 89 million biomedical sentences were tagged with SENNA on a 100 node
      cluster within three days. The accuracy of the presented relation extraction
      approach was evaluated on two test sets of annotated sentences resulting in
      precision/recall values of 0.71/0.43. We show that the accuracy as well as
      processing speed of the proposed semantic relation extraction approach is
      sufficient for its large scale application on biomedical text. The proposed
      approach is highly generalizable regarding the supported relation types and
      appears to be especially suited for general-purpose, broad-scale text mining
      systems. The presented approach bridges the gap between fast, co-occurrence-based
      approaches lacking semantic relations and highly specialized and computationally 
      demanding NLP approaches.

TI  - Manual annotation of protein interactions.
PG  - 75-95
LID - 10.1007/978-1-60761-175-2_5 [doi]
AB  - Protein interactions are the basic building blocks for assembly of pathways and
      networks. Almost any biologically meaningful functionality (for instance, linear 
      signaling pathways, chains of metabolic reactions, transcription factor dimmers, 
      protein complexes of transcriptosome, gene-disease associations) can be
      represented as a combination of binary relationships between "network objects"
      (genes, proteins, RNA species, bioactive compounds). Naturally, the assembled
      pathways and networks are only as good as their "weakest" link (i.e., a wrongly
      assigned interaction), and the errors multiply in multi-step pathways. Therefore,
      the utility of "systems biology" is fundamentally dependent on quality and
      relevance of protein interactions. The second important parameter is the sheer
      number of interactions assembled in the database. One needs a "critical mass" of 
      species-specific interactions in order to build cohesive networks for a gene
      list, not a constellation of non-connected proteins and protein pairs. The third 
      issue is semantic consistency between interactions of different types. Transient 
      physical signal transduction interactions, reactions of endogenous metabolism,
      transcription factor-promoter binding, and kinetic drug-target interactions are
      all very different in nature. Yet, they have to fit well into one database format
      and be consistent in order to be useful in reconstruction of cellular
      processes.High-quality protein interactions are available in peer-reviewed "small
      experiment" literature and, to a much smaller extent, patents. However, it is
      very challenging to find the interactions, annotate with searchable (and
      computable) parameters, catalogue in the database format in computer readable
      form, and assemble into a database. There are hundreds of thousands of mammalian 
      interactions scattered in tens of thousands of papers in a few thousands of
      scientific journals. There are no widely used standards for reporting the
      interactions in scientific texts and, therefore, text-mining tools have only
      limited applicability. In order to generate a meaningful database of protein
      interactions, one needs a well-developed technology of manual curation, equipped 
      with computational solutions, managerial procedures, quality control, and users' 
      feedback. Here we describe our ever-evolving annotation approach, the important
      annotation issues and our solutions, and the mammalian protein interactions
      database MetaBase which we have been working on for over 8 years.

PG  - 230-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To supply good information integration, knowledge representation, text
      mining, intellectual education and data sharing services by setting up
      neuroinformatics ontology. METHODS: By analyzing the structures and contents of
      current ontologies in the biomedical field, such as UMLS, Gene Ontology, Cancer
      Ontology, Anatomy Ontology, Disease Ontology and Drug Ontology, the concepts and 
      their relationships of neuroinformatics were discussed and the design principles,
      standards and norms, building methods and basic procedures of multi-level concept
      semantic networks-based neuroinformatics ontology constructed by Protege-OWL tool
      were presented in this article. RESULTS: A multi-level concept semantic
      network-based OWL (web ontology language) neuroinformatics ontology was built.
      CONCLUSION: The neuroinformatics ontology can bring about explicit definitions of
      concepts and their relationships in the field of neuroinformatics from different 
      formal models, build clear theoretical framework for neuroinformatics, achieve a 
      common understanding of related field knowledge and supply good services of
      information integration, knowledge representation, text mining, intelligent
      education and data sharing.

TI  - A representation and classification scheme for tree-like structures in medical
      images: analyzing the branching pattern of ductal trees in X-ray galactograms.
PG  - 487-93
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2008.929102 [doi]
AB  - We propose a multistep approach for representing and classifying tree-like
      structures in medical images. Tree-like structures are frequently encountered in 
      biomedical contexts; examples are the bronchial system, the vascular topology,
      and the breast ductal network. We use tree encoding techniques, such as the
      depth-first string encoding and the PrUfer encoding, to obtain a symbolic string 
      representation of the tree's branching topology; the problem of classifying trees
      is then reduced to string classification. We use the tf-idf text mining technique
      to assign a weight of significance to each string term (i.e., tree node label).
      Similarity searches and k-nearest neighbor classification of the trees is
      performed using the tf-idf weight vectors and the cosine similarity metric. We
      applied our approach to characterize the ductal tree-like parenchymal structure
      in X-ray galactograms, in order to distinguish among different radiological
      findings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
      approach with classification accuracy reaching up to 86%, and also indicate that 
      our method can potentially aid in providing insight to the relationship between
      branching patterns and function or pathology.

PG  - 364-74
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2008.01135.x [doi]
AB  - Disorders with overlapping diagnostic features are grouped into a network module.
      Based on phenotypic similarities or differential diagnoses, it is possible to
      identify functional pathways leading to individual features. We generated a
      Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS)-specific network module utilizing patient clinical
      data, text mining from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, and in
      vitro functional analysis. We tested our module by functional studies based on a 
      hypothesis that RAI1 acts through phenotype-specific pathways involving several
      downstream genes, which are altered due to RAI1 haploinsufficiency. A preliminary
      genome-wide gene expression study was performed using microarrays on RAI1
      haploinsufficient cells created by RNAi-based approximately 50% knockdown of RAI1
      in HEK293T cells. The top dysregulated genes were involved in growth signaling
      and insulin sensitivity, neuronal differentiation, lipid biosynthesis and fat
      mobilization, circadian activity, behavior, renal, cardiovascular and skeletal
      development, gene expression, and cell-cycle regulation and recombination,
      reflecting the spectrum of clinical features observed in SMS. Validation using
      real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed 
      the gene expression profile of 75% of the selected genes analyzed in both HEK293T
      RAI1 knockdown cells and SMS lymphoblastoid cell lines. Overall, these data
      support a method for identifying genes and pathways responsible for individual
      clinical features in a complex disorder such as SMS.

TI  - Collaborative text-annotation resource for disease-centered relation extraction
      from biomedical text.
PG  - 967-77
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2009.02.001 [doi]
AB  - Agglomerating results from studies of individual biological components has shown 
      the potential to produce biomedical discovery and the promise of therapeutic
      development. Such knowledge integration could be tremendously facilitated by
      automated text mining for relation extraction in the biomedical literature.
      Relation extraction systems cannot be developed without substantial datasets
      annotated with ground truth for benchmarking and training. The creation of such
      datasets is hampered by the absence of a resource for launching a distributed
      annotation effort, as well as by the lack of a standardized annotation schema. We
      have developed an annotation schema and an annotation tool which can be widely
      adopted so that the resulting annotated corpora from a multitude of disease
      studies could be assembled into a unified benchmark dataset. The contribution of 
      this paper is threefold. First, we provide an overview of available benchmark
      corpora and derive a simple annotation schema for specific binary relation
      extraction problems such as protein-protein and gene-disease relation extraction.
      Second, we present BioNotate: an open source annotation resource for the
      distributed creation of a large corpus. Third, we present and make available the 
      results of a pilot annotation effort of the autism disease network.

TI  - Oleate regulates genes controlled by signaling pathways of mitogen-activated
      protein kinase, insulin, and hypoxia.

AB  - Oleate (C18:1) is, besides palmitate (C16:0), the most abundant fatty acid in the
      human diet, and its involvement in the development of insulin resistance is
      broadly discussed. Because its influence on gene expression is poorly defined in 
      mammalian cells, we performed whole genome expression profiling and quantitative 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction in the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 to
      identify oleate-regulated genes. In this respect, HepG2 cells were exposed for 24
      hours to a physiologic concentration of oleate coupled to bovine serum albumin
      (BSA) (200 micromol/L) or BSA alone. Subsequent microarray analysis revealed 14
      genes that were significantly (single-sided permutational t test, P < .05)
      regulated after oleate treatment. To decipher the functional and regulatory
      connections of these genes, a text mining approach combined with transcription
      factor binding site analysis was performed using Genomatix BiblioSphere (Munich, 
      Germany) and MatInspector (Munich, Germany). The oleate-inducible genes encoding 
      early growth response 1, c-fos, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, and splicing
      factor 2 are mapped into a network, which is controlled by signaling pathways of 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase, insulin, or hypoxia. Comparative in silico
      promoter analysis revealed putative regulation of oleate-sensitive genes through 
      v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 and retinoid X receptor
      family. In sum, a physiologic oleate concentration modulates genes expression in 
      a very sensitive way as 14 genes were regulated.

AB  - Epigenetic studies in cancer pathways have been essential in helping scientists
      understand the key players in cancer. Gene relationships reported in biomedical
      literature are valuable to understand the interaction network. Nevertheless,
      biomedical literature is growing rapidly and the scientific community needs a
      mechanism to have up-to-date pathways that reflect the new findings from the
      literature. In this work, we are developing informatics tools to extract gene
      relationship from literature using text mining and semantic understanding.

      gene-interaction network.
PG  - i277-85
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn182 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Understanding the role of genetics in diseases is one of the most
      important aims of the biological sciences. The completion of the Human Genome
      Project has led to a rapid increase in the number of publications in this area.
      However, the coverage of curated databases that provide information manually
      extracted from the literature is limited. Another challenge is that determining
      disease-related genes requires laborious experiments. Therefore, predicting good 
      candidate genes before experimental analysis will save time and effort. We
      introduce an automatic approach based on text mining and network analysis to
      predict gene-disease associations. We collected an initial set of known
      disease-related genes and built an interaction network by automatic literature
      mining based on dependency parsing and support vector machines. Our hypothesis is
      that the central genes in this disease-specific network are likely to be related 
      to the disease. We used the degree, eigenvector, betweenness and closeness
      centrality metrics to rank the genes in the network. RESULTS: The proposed
      approach can be used to extract known and to infer unknown gene-disease
      associations. We evaluated the approach for prostate cancer. Eigenvector and
      degree centrality achieved high accuracy. A total of 95% of the top 20 genes
      ranked by these methods are confirmed to be related to prostate cancer. On the
      other hand, betweenness and closeness centrality predicted more genes whose
      relation to the disease is currently unknown and are candidates for experimental 
      study. AVAILABILITY: A web-based system for browsing the disease-specific
      gene-interaction networks is available at: http://gin.ncibi.org.

PG  - W411-5
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkn281 [doi]
AB  - Protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction has been an important research topic
      in bio-text mining area, since the PPI information is critical for understanding 
      biological processes. However, there are very few open systems available on the
      Web and most of the systems focus on keyword searching based on predefined PPIs. 
      PIE (Protein Interaction information Extraction system) is a configurable Web
      service to extract PPIs from literature, including user-provided papers as well
      as PubMed articles. After providing abstracts or papers, the prediction results
      are displayed in an easily readable form with essential, yet compact features.
      The PIE interface supports more features such as PDF file extraction, PubMed
      search tool and network communication, which are useful for biologists and
      bio-system developers. The PIE system utilizes natural language processing
      techniques and machine learning methodologies to predict PPI sentences, which
      results in high precision performance for Web users. PIE is freely available at
      http://bi.snu.ac.kr/pie/.

      system for analysis of DNA microarray data with a focus on lipid metabolism.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Genome-wide gene-expression data from DNA-microarray technology and
      molecular-network data from computational text-mining have led to a paradigm
      shift in biological research. However, interpretation of the huge amount of data 
      is a bottleneck. We have developed an informatics system, which we refer to as
      bioSpace Explorer, that can extract pathways and molecules of interest from
      genome-wide data and show the mutual relationships among these pathways and
      molecules. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes and the action of a
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist or
      alpha-linolenic acid on this process was analyzed with bioSpace Explorer. The
      results suggested a biological basis for adipocyte differentiation and a strategy
      to enhance lipid oxidation in adipocytes. Clustered changes of molecules were
      apparent in the insulin, Wnt, and PPARgamma signaling pathways and in the
      lipogenesis, lipid oxidation, and lipid transport pathways during cell
      differentiation. A PPARgamma agonist enhanced lipid oxidation in adipocytes and
      alpha-linolenic acid gave similar results to the PPARgamma agonist. An analysis
      of sex hormone and thyroid hormone, in addition to PPARgamma signaling, suggested
      that these molecules are important for enhancement of lipid oxidation in
      adipocytes. The results indicate the utility of bioSpace Explorer for biological 
      research on genome-wide molecular networks.

      Neuroscience from 2001 to 2006.
PG  - e2052
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0002052 [doi]
AB  - Annual meeting abstracts published by scientific societies often contain rich
      arrays of information that can be computationally mined and distilled to
      elucidate the state and dynamics of the subject field. We extracted and processed
      abstract data from the Society for Neuroscience (SFN) annual meeting abstracts
      during the period 2001-2006 in order to gain an objective view of contemporary
      neuroscience. An important first step in the process was the application of data 
      cleaning and disambiguation methods to construct a unified database, since the
      data were too noisy to be of full utility in the raw form initially available.
      Using natural language processing, text mining, and other data analysis
      techniques, we then examined the demographics and structure of the scientific
      collaboration network, the dynamics of the field over time, major research
      trends, and the structure of the sources of research funding. Some interesting
      findings include a high geographical concentration of neuroscience research in
      the north eastern United States, a surprisingly large transient population (66%
      of the authors appear in only one out of the six studied years), the central role
      played by the study of neurodegenerative disorders in the neuroscience community,
      and an apparent growth of behavioral/systems neuroscience with a corresponding
      shrinkage of cellular/molecular neuroscience over the six year period. The
      results from this work will prove useful for scientists, policy makers, and
      funding agencies seeking to gain a complete and unbiased picture of the community
      structure and body of knowledge encapsulated by a specific scientific domain.

TI  - Extraction of semantic biomedical relations from text using conditional random
      fields.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-9-207 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing amount of published literature in biomedicine
      represents an immense source of knowledge, which can only efficiently be accessed
      by a new generation of automated information extraction tools. Named entity
      recognition of well-defined objects, such as genes or proteins, has achieved a
      sufficient level of maturity such that it can form the basis for the next step:
      the extraction of relations that exist between the recognized entities. Whereas
      most early work focused on the mere detection of relations, the classification of
      the type of relation is also of great importance and this is the focus of this
      work. In this paper we describe an approach that extracts both the existence of a
      relation and its type. Our work is based on Conditional Random Fields, which have
      been applied with much success to the task of named entity recognition. RESULTS: 
      We benchmark our approach on two different tasks. The first task is the
      identification of semantic relations between diseases and treatments. The
      available data set consists of manually annotated PubMed abstracts. The second
      task is the identification of relations between genes and diseases from a set of 
      concise phrases, so-called GeneRIF (Gene Reference Into Function) phrases. In our
      experimental setting, we do not assume that the entities are given, as is often
      the case in previous relation extraction work. Rather the extraction of the
      entities is solved as a subproblem. Compared with other state-of-the-art
      approaches, we achieve very competitive results on both data sets. To demonstrate
      the scalability of our solution, we apply our approach to the complete human
      GeneRIF database. The resulting gene-disease network contains 34758 semantic
      associations between 4939 genes and 1745 diseases. The gene-disease network is
      publicly available as a machine-readable RDF graph. CONCLUSION: We extend the
      framework of Conditional Random Fields towards the annotation of semantic
      relations from text and apply it to the biomedical domain. Our approach is based 
      on a rich set of textual features and achieves a performance that is competitive 
      to leading approaches. The model is quite general and can be extended to handle
      arbitrary biological entities and relation types. The resulting gene-disease
      network shows that the GeneRIF database provides a rich knowledge source for text
      mining. Current work is focused on improving the accuracy of detection of
      entities as well as entity boundaries, which will also greatly improve the
      relation extraction performance.

TI  - Using the iHOP information resource to mine the biomedical literature on genes,
      proteins, and chemical compounds.
PG  - Unit1.16
LID - 10.1002/0471250953.bi0116s20 [doi]
AB  - The iHOP (Information Hyperlinked over Proteins) resource employs sophisticated
      text-mining methods to assist researchers in their quest for information on
      specific genes and proteins, their physical interactions and regulatory
      relationships, their relevance in pathologies, and their interactions with
      chemical compounds. iHOP parses thousands of PubMed documents every day and
      collects information specific to thousands of different biological molecules.
      Rather than providing long lists of entire abstracts upon keyword searches, iHOP 
      selectively retrieves information that is specific to genes and proteins, and
      summarizes their interactions and functions. In iHOP, with genes and proteins
      acting as hyperlinks between sentences and abstracts, a large part of the PubMed 
      knowledgebase becomes a giant navigable information network.

TI  - Different signaling pathways expressed by chicken naive CD4(+) T cells, CD4(+)
      lymphocytes activated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B, and those malignantly
      transformed by Marek's disease virus.
PG  - 2380-7
LID - 10.1021/pr700844z [doi]
AB  - Proteomics methods, based on liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, 
      produce large "shotgun" proteomes that are most appropriately compared not at the
      level of differentially expressed proteins only but at the more comprehensive
      level of biological networks and pathways. This is now possible with the
      emergence of functional annotation databases and tools, databases of canonical
      pathways and molecular interactions and computational text mining tools. Here, we
      used shotgun proteomics, and the differential proteomics modeling functionalities
      available in the Pathwaystudio network modeling program to define the cell
      physiology of Hodgkin's disease antigen-overexpressing (CD30 (hi)) CD4 (+) T cell
      lymphomas using the unique Marek's disease (MD) natural animal model. CD30 (hi)
      lymphoma cells have characteristics of activated T cells but are also
      fundamentally different from their nontransformed healthy counterparts. We
      compared the cell physiology of naive, superantigen-activated and MD-transformed 
      CD4 (+) T cell proteomes. While the superantigen-activated cells had signaling
      pathways associated with cell activation, inflammation, proliferation and cell
      death, the MD-transformed cells had growth factor, cytokine, adhesion, and
      transcription factor signaling responses associated with oncogenicity, cell
      proliferation, angiogenesis, motility, and metastasis.

TI  - RegulonDB (version 6.0): gene regulation model of Escherichia coli K-12 beyond
      transcription, active (experimental) annotated promoters and Textpresso
      navigation.
PG  - D120-4
AB  - RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) is the primary reference database
      offering curated knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory network of
      Escherichia coli K12, currently the best-known electronically encoded database of
      the genetic regulatory network of any free-living organism. This paper summarizes
      the improvements, new biology and new features available in version 6.0. Curation
      of original literature is, from now on, up to date for every new release. All the
      objects are supported by their corresponding evidences, now classified as strong 
      or weak. Transcription factors are classified by origin of their effectors and by
      gene ontology class. We have now computational predictions for sigma(54) and five
      different promoter types of the sigma(70) family, as well as their corresponding 
      -10 and -35 boxes. In addition to those curated from the literature, we added
      about 300 experimentally mapped promoters coming from our own high-throughput
      mapping efforts. RegulonDB v.6.0 now expands beyond transcription initiation,
      including RNA regulatory elements, specifically riboswitches, attenuators and
      small RNAs, with their known associated targets. The data can be accessed through
      overviews of correlations about gene regulation. RegulonDB associated original
      literature, together with more than 4000 curation notes, can now be searched with
      the Textpresso text mining engine.

TI  - STITCH: interaction networks of chemicals and proteins.
PG  - D684-8
AB  - The knowledge about interactions between proteins and small molecules is
      essential for the understanding of molecular and cellular functions. However,
      information on such interactions is widely dispersed across numerous databases
      and the literature. To facilitate access to this data, STITCH ('search tool for
      interactions of chemicals') integrates information about interactions from
      metabolic pathways, crystal structures, binding experiments and drug-target
      relationships. Inferred information from phenotypic effects, text mining and
      chemical structure similarity is used to predict relations between chemicals.
      STITCH further allows exploring the network of chemical relations, also in the
      context of associated binding proteins. Each proposed interaction can be traced
      back to the original data sources. Our database contains interaction information 
      for over 68,000 different chemicals, including 2200 drugs, and connects them to
      1.5 million genes across 373 genomes and their interactions contained in the
      STRING database. STITCH is available at http://stitch.embl.de/.

TI  - BioCAD: an information fusion platform for bio-network inference and analysis.
PG  - S2
AB  - BACKGROUND: As systems biology has begun to draw growing attention, bio-network
      inference and analysis have become more and more important. Though there have
      been many efforts for bio-network inference, they are still far from practical
      applications due to too many false inferences and lack of comprehensible
      interpretation in the biological viewpoints. In order for applying to real
      problems, they should provide effective inference, reliable validation, rational 
      elucidation, and sufficient extensibility to incorporate various relevant
      information sources. RESULTS: We have been developing an information fusion
      software platform called BioCAD. It is utilizing both of local and global
      optimization for bio-network inference, text mining techniques for network
      validation and annotation, and Web services-based workflow techniques. In
      addition, it includes an effective technique to elucidate network edges by
      integrating various information sources. This paper presents the architecture of 
      BioCAD and essential modules for bio-network inference and analysis. CONCLUSION: 
      BioCAD provides a convenient infrastructure for network inference and network
      analysis. It automates series of users' processes by providing data preprocessing
      tools for various formats of data. It also helps inferring more accurate and
      reliable bio-networks by providing network inference tools which utilize
      information from distinct sources. And it can be used to analyze and validate the
      inferred bio-networks using information fusion tools.

TI  - Literature-based compound profiling: application to toxicogenomics.
PG  - 1521-34
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To reduce continuously increasing costs in drug development,
      adverse effects of drugs need to be detected as early as possible in the process.
      In recent years, compound-induced gene expression profiling methodologies have
      been developed to assess compound toxicity, including Gene Ontology term and
      pathway over-representation analyses. The objective of this study was to
      introduce an additional approach, in which literature information is used for
      compound profiling to evaluate compound toxicity and mode of toxicity. METHODS:
      Gene annotations were built by text mining in Medline abstracts for retrieval of 
      co-publications between genes, pathology terms, biological processes and
      pathways. This literature information was used to generate compound-specific
      keyword fingerprints, representing over-represented keywords calculated in a set 
      of regulated genes after compound administration. To see whether keyword
      fingerprints can be used for assessment of compound toxicity, we analyzed
      microarray data sets of rat liver treated with 11 hepatotoxicants. RESULTS:
      Analysis of keyword fingerprints of two genotoxic carcinogens, two nongenotoxic
      carcinogens, two peroxisome proliferators and two randomly generated gene sets,
      showed that each compound produced a specific keyword fingerprint that correlated
      with the experimentally observed histopathological events induced by the
      individual compounds. By contrast, the random sets produced a flat aspecific
      keyword profile, indicating that the fingerprints induced by the compounds
      reflect biological events rather than random noise. A more detailed analysis of
      the keyword profiles of diethylhexylphthalate, dimethylnitrosamine and
      methapyrilene (MPy) showed that the differences in the keyword fingerprints of
      these three compounds are based upon known distinct modes of action.
      Visualization of MPy-linked keywords and MPy-induced genes in a literature
      network enabled us to construct a mode of toxicity proposal for MPy, which is in 
      agreement with known effects of MPy in literature. CONCLUSION: Compound keyword
      fingerprinting based on information retrieved from literature is a powerful
      approach for compound profiling, allowing evaluation of compound toxicity and
      analysis of the mode of action.

      Processing.
PG  - 293
AB  - BACKGROUND: Manual curation of biological databases, an expensive and
      labor-intensive process, is essential for high quality integrated data. In this
      paper we report the implementation of a state-of-the-art Natural Language
      Processing system that creates computer-readable networks of regulatory
      interactions directly from different collections of abstracts and full-text
      papers. Our major aim is to understand how automatic annotation using Text-Mining
      techniques can complement manual curation of biological databases. We implemented
      a rule-based system to generate networks from different sets of documents dealing
      with regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. RESULTS: Performance evaluation is
      based on the most comprehensive transcriptional regulation database for any
      organism, the manually-curated RegulonDB, 45% of which we were able to recreate
      automatically. From our automated analysis we were also able to find some new
      interactions from papers not already curated, or that were missed in the manual
      filtering and review of the literature. We also put forward a novel Regulatory
      Interaction Markup Language better suited than SBML for simultaneously
      representing data of interest for biologists and text miners. CONCLUSION: Manual 
      curation of the output of automatic processing of text is a good way to
      complement a more detailed review of the literature, either for validating the
      results of what has been already annotated, or for discovering facts and
      information that might have been overlooked at the triage or curation stages.

TI  - A protein interaction atlas for the nuclear receptors: properties and quality of 
      a hub-based dimerisation network.
PG  - 34
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nuclear receptors are a large family of eukaryotic transcription 
      factors that constitute major pharmacological targets. They exert their
      combinatorial control through homotypic heterodimerisation. Elucidation of this
      dimerisation network is vital in order to understand the complex dynamics and
      potential cross-talk involved. RESULTS: Phylogeny, protein-protein interactions, 
      protein-DNA interactions and gene expression data have been integrated to provide
      a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the topology and properties of the 
      nuclear receptor interaction network in humans. We discriminate between
      DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding dimers, and provide a comprehensive interaction
      map, that identifies potential cross-talk between the various pathways of nuclear
      receptors. CONCLUSION: We infer that the topology of this network is hub-based,
      and much more connected than previously thought. The hub-based topology of the
      network and the wide tissue expression pattern of NRs create a highly competitive
      environment for the common heterodimerising partners. Furthermore, a significant 
      number of negative feedback loops is present, with the hub protein SHP [NR0B2]
      playing a major role. We also compare the evolution, topology and properties of
      the nuclear receptor network with the hub-based dimerisation network of the bHLH 
      transcription factors in order to identify both unique themes and ubiquitous
      properties in gene regulation. In terms of methodology, we conclude that such a
      comprehensive picture can only be assembled by semi-automated text-mining, manual
      curation and integration of data from various sources.

TI  - Applied information retrieval and multidisciplinary research: new mechanistic
      hypotheses in complex regional pain syndrome.
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collaborative efforts of physicians and basic scientists are often
      necessary in the investigation of complex disorders. Difficulties can arise,
      however, when large amounts of information need to reviewed. Advanced information
      retrieval can be beneficial in combining and reviewing data obtained from the
      various scientific fields. In this paper, a team of investigators with varying
      backgrounds has applied advanced information retrieval methods, in the form of
      text mining and entity relationship tools, to review the current literature, with
      the intention to generate new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying a
      complex disorder. As an example of such a disorder the Complex Regional Pain
      Syndrome (CRPS) was chosen. CRPS is a painful and debilitating syndrome with a
      complex etiology that is still unraveled for a considerable part, resulting in
      suboptimal diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: A text mining based approach
      combined with a simple network analysis identified Nuclear Factor kappa B
      (NFkappaB) as a possible central mediator in both the initiation and progression 
      of CRPS. CONCLUSION: The result shows the added value of a multidisciplinary
      approach combined with information retrieval in hypothesis discovery in
      biomedical research. The new hypothesis, which was derived in silico, provides a 
      framework for further mechanistic studies into the underlying molecular
      mechanisms of CRPS and requires evaluation in clinical and epidemiological
      studies.

TI  - Data mining and predictive modeling of biomolecular network from biomedical
      literature databases.
PG  - 251-63
AB  - In this paper, we present a novel approach Bio-IEDM (Biomedical Information
      Extraction and Data Mining) to integrate text mining and predictive modeling to
      analyze biomolecular network from biomedical literature databases. Our method
      consists of two phases. In phase 1, we discuss a semisupervised efficient
      learning approach to automatically extract biological relationships such as
      protein-protein interaction, protein-gene interaction from the biomedical
      literature databases to construct the biomolecular network. Our method
      automatically learns the patterns based on a few user seed tuples and then
      extracts new tuples from the biomedical literature based on the discovered
      patterns. The derived biomolecular network forms a large scale-free network
      graph. In phase 2, we present a novel clustering algorithm to analyze the
      biomolecular network graph to identify biologically meaningful subnetworks
      (communities). The clustering algorithm considers the characteristics of the
      scale-free network graphs and is based on the local density of the vertex and its
      neighborhood functions that can be used to find more meaningful clusters with
      different density level. The experimental results indicate our approach is very
      effective in extracting biological knowledge from a huge collection of biomedical
      literature. The integration of data mining and information extraction provides a 
      promising direction for analyzing the biomolecular network.

TI  - An application of bioinformatics and text mining to the discovery of novel genes 
      related to bone biology.
PG  - 1378-88
AB  - The treatment and management of complex genetic diseases such as osteoporosis can
      greatly benefit from the integration of relevant research across many different
      disciplines. We created a text mining tool that analyzes the PubMed literature
      database and integrates the available genomic information to provide a detailed
      mapping of the genes and their interrelationships within a particular network
      such as osteoporosis. The results obtained from our text mining program show that
      existing genomic data within the PubMed database can effectively be used to
      predict potentially novel target genes for osteoporosis research that have not
      previously been reported in the literature. To filter the most significant
      findings, we developed a ranking system to rate our predicted novel genes. Some
      of our predicted genes ranked higher than those currently studied, suggesting
      that they may be of particular interest from a therapeutic standpoint. A
      preliminary analysis of the current biomedical literature in our research area
      using our tool suggests that S100A12, as well as a group of SMAD genes previously
      unstudied in relation to osteoporosis, may be highly relevant to the mechanism of
      action of bisphosphonates, that the function of osteocytes may be influenced by a
      family of important interleukins and interleukin-related molecules, and that the 
      FYN oncogene may play an important role in regulating the apoptosis of bone cells
      in the context of degenerative bone diseases. An evaluation of our tool's
      predictive ability with an analysis of PubMed literature published before the
      year 2000 in the area of osteoporosis research shows that many of its top-rated
      novel target genes from that analysis were later studied and shown to be relevant
      to osteoporosis in the period between 2000 and 2006. We believe that our tool
      will be beneficial to researchers in the field of orthopaedics seeking to
      identify novel target genes in their research area, and it will allow them to
      delve deeper into the complex interplay between genes, biological systems and
      diseases.

TI  - Global mapping of gene/protein interactions in PubMed abstracts: a framework and 
      an experiment with P53 interactions.
PG  - 453-64
AB  - Gene/protein interactions provide critical information for a thorough
      understanding of cellular processes. Recently, considerable interest and effort
      has been focused on the construction and analysis of genome-wide gene networks.
      The large body of biomedical literature is an important source of gene/protein
      interaction information. Recent advances in text mining tools have made it
      possible to automatically extract such documented interactions from free-text
      literature. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for constructing 
      and analyzing large-scale gene functional networks based on the gene/protein
      interactions extracted from biomedical literature repositories using text mining 
      tools. Our proposed framework consists of analyses of the network topology,
      network topology-gene function relationship, and temporal network evolution to
      distill valuable information embedded in the gene functional interactions in the 
      literature. We demonstrate the application of the proposed framework using a
      testbed of P53-related PubMed abstracts, which shows that the literature-based
      P53 networks exhibit small-world and scale-free properties. We also found that
      high degree genes in the literature-based networks have a high probability of
      appearing in the manually curated database and genes in the same pathway tend to 
      form local clusters in our literature-based networks. Temporal analysis showed
      that genes interacting with many other genes tend to be involved in a large
      number of newly discovered interactions.

TI  - AphidBase: a database for aphid genomic resources.
PG  - 783-4
AB  - UNLABELLED: AphidBase aims to (i) store recently acquired genomic resources on
      aphids and (ii) compare them to other insect resources as functional annotation
      tools. For that, the Drosophila melanogaster genome has been loaded in the
      database using the GMOD open source software for a comparison with the 17 069 pea
      aphid unique transcripts (contigs) and the 13 639 gene transcripts of the
      Anopheles gambiae. Links to FlyBase and A.gambiae Entrez databases allow a rapid 
      characterization of the putative functions of the aphid sequences. Text mining of
      the D.melanogaster literature was performed to construct a network of co-cited
      gene or protein names, which should facilitate functional annotation of aphid
      homolog sequences. AphidBase represents one of the first genomic databases for a 
      hemipteran insect. AVAILABILITY: http://w3.rennes.inra.fr/AphidBase.

TI  - Analysis of news of the Japanese asbestos panic: a supposedly resolved issue that
      turned out to be a time bomb.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asbestos-linked public health problems were widely reported in Japan,
      in 2005. The objective is to apply text mining with network analysis to
      characterize these problems. METHODS: Text mining with network analysis of
      newspaper headlines including the word 'asbestos' published in 1987 and 2005 was 
      conducted. Outcome measures are occurrence of the words and simultaneous
      occurrence of two words in the newspaper headlines. RESULTS: In 36 headlines,
      which contained the word 'asbestos' in 1987, the word 'pollution' (40%) appeared 
      most frequently, followed by 'removal' (31%) and 'campaign' (29%). For
      combinations of words, the following occurred most frequently: 'campaign and
      expulsion' (26%) followed by 'removal and campaign' (14%). Of 293 headlines in
      2005, the following words appeared: 'hazard' (31%), 'person' (16%) and 'death'
      (13%). For combinations, the following appeared: 'person and death' (9%).
      Asbestos pollution and removal campaigns were reported in 1987, but the death of 
      citizens was reported in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Text mining with network analysis,
      which presents one of the methods for visualization of text data, suggests the
      following insight. Insufficient steps against asbestos had been taken for 20
      years, which is compatible with the latency period. It has resulted in widespread
      exposure to asbestos and more severe asbestos-related public health problems
      among citizens. This methodology suggests that analyzing text data by this method
      can serve future surveillance and efficient use of epidemiological knowledge.

TI  - Text mining of full-text journal articles combined with gene expression analysis 
      reveals a relationship between sphingosine-1-phosphate and invasiveness of a
      glioblastoma cell line.
PG  - 373
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lysophospholipid, is involved in
      various cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and survival. To
      date, the impact of S1P on human glioblastoma is not fully understood.
      Particularly, the concerted role played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and
      S1P in aggressive tumor behavior and angiogenesis remains to be elucidated.
      RESULTS: To gain new insights in the effect of S1P on angiogenesis and invasion
      of this type of malignant tumor, we used microarrays to investigate the gene
      expression in glioblastoma as a response to S1P administration in vitro. We
      compared the expression profiles for the same cell lines under the influence of
      epidermal growth factor (EGF), an important growth factor. We found a set of 72
      genes that are significantly differentially expressed as a unique response to
      S1P. Based on the result of mining full-text articles from 20 scientific journals
      in the field of cancer research published over a period of five years, we
      inferred gene-gene interaction networks for these 72 differentially expressed
      genes. Among the generated networks, we identified a particularly interesting
      one. It describes a cascading event, triggered by S1P, leading to the
      transactivation of MMP-9 via neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF), and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). This
      interaction network has the potential to shed new light on our understanding of
      the role played by MMP-9 in invasive glioblastomas. CONCLUSION: Automated
      extraction of information from biological literature promises to play an
      increasingly important role in biological knowledge discovery. This is
      particularly true for high-throughput approaches, such as microarrays, and for
      combining and integrating data from different sources. Text mining may hold the
      key to unraveling previously unknown relationships between biological entities
      and could develop into an indispensable instrument in the process of formulating 
      novel and potentially promising hypotheses.

TI  - The cognitive phenotype of Down syndrome: insights from intracellular network
      analysis.
PG  - 396-406
AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. All individuals with DS
      exhibit some level of cognitive dysfunction. It is generally accepted that these 
      abnormalities are a result of the upregulation of genes encoded by chromosome 21.
      Many chromosome 21 proteins are known or predicted to function in critical
      neurological processes, but typically they function as modulators of these
      processes, not as key regulators. Thus, upregulation in DS is expected to cause
      only modest perturbations of normal processes. Systematic approaches such as
      intracellular network construction and analysis have not been generally applied
      in DS research. Networks can be assembled from high-throughput experiments or by 
      text-mining of experimental literature. We survey some new developments in
      constructing such networks, focusing on newly developed network analysis
      methodologies. We propose how these methods could be integrated with creation and
      manipulation of mouse models of DS to advance our understanding of the perturbed 
      cell signaling pathways in DS. This understanding could lead to potential
      therapeutics.

TI  - Conceptual biology, hypothesis discovery, and text mining: Swanson's legacy.
PG  - 2
AB  - Innovative biomedical librarians and information specialists who want to expand
      their roles as expert searchers need to know about profound changes in biology
      and parallel trends in text mining. In recent years, conceptual biology has
      emerged as a complement to empirical biology. This is partly in response to the
      availability of massive digital resources such as the network of databases for
      molecular biologists at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.
      Developments in text mining and hypothesis discovery systems based on the early
      work of Swanson, a mathematician and information scientist, are coincident with
      the emergence of conceptual biology. Very little has been written to introduce
      biomedical digital librarians to these new trends. In this paper, background for 
      data and text mining, as well as for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and
      in text (KDT) is presented, then a brief review of Swanson's ideas, followed by a
      discussion of recent approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing. 'Testing' in
      the context of text mining involves partially automated methods for finding
      evidence in the literature to support hypothetical relationships. Concluding
      remarks follow regarding (a) the limits of current strategies for evaluation of
      hypothesis discovery systems and (b) the role of literature-based discovery in
      concert with empirical research. Report of an informatics-driven literature
      review for biomarkers of systemic lupus erythematosus is mentioned. Swanson's
      vision of the hidden value in the literature of science and, by extension, in
      biomedical digital databases, is still remarkably generative for information
      scientists, biologists, and physicians.

TI  - Automatic pathway building in biological association networks.
PG  - 171
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientific literature is a source of the most reliable and
      comprehensive knowledge about molecular interaction networks. Formalization of
      this knowledge is necessary for computational analysis and is achieved by
      automatic fact extraction using various text-mining algorithms. Most of these
      techniques suffer from high false positive rates and redundancy of the extracted 
      information. The extracted facts form a large network with no pathways defined.
      RESULTS: We describe the methodology for automatic curation of Biological
      Association Networks (BANs) derived by a natural language processing technology
      called Medscan. The curated data is used for automatic pathway reconstruction.
      The algorithm for the reconstruction of signaling pathways is also described and 
      validated by comparison with manually curated pathways and tissue-specific gene
      expression profiles. CONCLUSION: Biological Association Networks extracted by
      MedScan technology contain sufficient information for constructing thousands of
      mammalian signaling pathways for multiple tissues. The automatically curated
      MedScan data is adequate for automatic generation of good quality signaling
      networks. The automatically generated Regulome pathways and manually curated
      pathways used for their validation are available free in the ResNetCore database 
      from Ariadne Genomics, Inc. 1. The pathways can be viewed and analyzed through
      the use of a free demo version of PathwayStudio software. The Medscan technology 
      is also available for evaluation using the free demo version of PathwayStudio
      software.

TI  - WNT antagonist, SFRP1, is Hedgehog signaling target.
PG  - 171-5
AB  - Hedgehog and WNT signaling pathways network together during embryogenesis and
      carcinogenesis. Hedgehog signaling in intestinal epithelium represses canonical
      WNT signaling to restrict expression of WNT target genes to stem or progenitor
      cells; however, the mechanism remains unclear. The Hedgehog signal is transduced 
      to GLI family transcription factors though Patched receptor, Smoothened signal
      transducer, and other signaling components, such as KIF27, KIF7, STK36, SUFU, and
      DZIP1. Here, we searched for the GLI-binding site within the promoter region of
      genes encoding secreted-type WNT signal inhibitors, including SFRP1, SFRP2,
      SFRP3, SFRP4, SFRP5, DKK1, DKK2, DKK3, DKK4, and WIF1. The GLI-binding site was
      identified within the human SFRP1 promoter based on bioinformatics and human
      intelligence. The chimpanzee SFRP1 gene was identified within the NW_110515.1
      genome sequence. The GLI-binding site of the human SFRP1 promoter was conserved
      in chimpanzee SFRP1, mouse Sfrp1, and rat Sfrp1 promoters. SFRP1 is the
      evolutionarily conserved target of the Hedgehog-GLI signaling pathway. Expression
      domain analyses based on text mining revealed that Indian Hedgehog (IHH), SFRP1, 
      and WNT6 are expressed in differentiated intestinal epithelial cells, mesenchymal
      cells, and stem/progenitor cells, respectively. Hedgehog is secreted from
      differentiated epithelial cells to induce SFRP1 expression in mesenchymal cells, 
      which keeps differentiated epithelial cells away from the effects of canonical
      WNT signaling. These facts indicate that SFRP1 is the Hedgehog target to confine 
      canonical WNT signaling within stem or progenitor cells. Therefore, epigenetic
      CpG hypermethylation of the SFRP1 promoter during chronic persistent inflammation
      and aging leads to the occurrence of gastrointestinal cancers, such as colorectal
      cancer and gastric cancer, through the breakdown of Hedgehog-dependent WNT signal
      inhibition.

TI  - Using co-occurrence network structure to extract synonymous gene and protein
      names from MEDLINE abstracts.
PG  - 103
AB  - BACKGROUND: Text-mining can assist biomedical researchers in reducing information
      overload by extracting useful knowledge from large collections of text. We
      developed a novel text-mining method based on analyzing the network structure
      created by symbol co-occurrences as a way to extend the capabilities of knowledge
      extraction. The method was applied to the task of automatic gene and protein name
      synonym extraction. RESULTS: Performance was measured on a test set consisting of
      about 50,000 abstracts from one year of MEDLINE. Synonyms retrieved from curated 
      genomics databases were used as a gold standard. The system obtained a maximum
      F-score of 22.21% (23.18% precision and 21.36% recall), with high efficiency in
      the use of seed pairs. CONCLUSION: The method performs comparably with other
      studied methods, does not rely on sophisticated named-entity recognition, and
      requires little initial seed knowledge.

TI  - Content-rich biological network constructed by mining PubMed abstracts.
PG  - 147
AB  - BACKGROUND: The integration of the rapidly expanding corpus of information about 
      the genome, transcriptome, and proteome, engendered by powerful technological
      advances, such as microarrays, and the availability of genomic sequence from
      multiple species, challenges the grasp and comprehension of the scientific
      community. Despite the existence of text-mining methods that identify biological 
      relationships based on the textual co-occurrence of gene/protein terms or
      similarities in abstract texts, knowledge of the underlying molecular connections
      on a large scale, which is prerequisite to understanding novel biological
      processes, lags far behind the accumulation of data. While computationally
      efficient, the co-occurrence-based approaches fail to characterize (e.g.,
      inhibition or stimulation, directionality) biological interactions. Programs with
      natural language processing (NLP) capability have been created to address these
      limitations, however, they are in general not readily accessible to the public.
      RESULTS: We present a NLP-based text-mining approach, Chilibot, which constructs 
      content-rich relationship networks among biological concepts, genes, proteins, or
      drugs. Amongst its features, suggestions for new hypotheses can be generated.
      Lastly, we provide evidence that the connectivity of molecular networks extracted
      from the biological literature follows the power-law distribution, indicating
      scale-free topologies consistent with the results of previous experimental
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Chilibot distills scientific relationships from knowledge 
      available throughout a wide range of biological domains and presents these in a
      content-rich graphical format, thus integrating general biomedical knowledge with
      the specialized knowledge and interests of the user. Chilibot

TI  - Tools for loading MEDLINE into a local relational database.
PG  - 146
AB  - BACKGROUND: Researchers who use MEDLINE for text mining, information extraction, 
      or natural language processing may benefit from having a copy of MEDLINE that
      they can manage locally. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) distributes
      MEDLINE in eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-formatted text files, but it is
      difficult to query MEDLINE in that format. We have developed software tools to
      parse the MEDLINE data files and load their contents into a relational database. 
      Although the task is conceptually straightforward, the size and scope of MEDLINE 
      make the task nontrivial. Given the increasing importance of text analysis in
      biology and medicine, we believe a local installation of MEDLINE will provide
      helpful computing infrastructure for researchers. RESULTS: We developed three
      software packages that parse and load MEDLINE, and ran each package to install
      separate instances of the MEDLINE database. For each installation, we collected
      data on loading time and disk-space utilization to provide examples of the
      process in different settings. Settings differed in terms of commercial
      database-management system (IBM DB2 or Oracle 9i), processor (Intel or Sun),
      programming language of installation software (Java or Perl), and methods
      employed in different versions of the software. The loading times for the three
      installations were 76 hours, 196 hours, and 132 hours, and disk-space utilization
      was 46.3 GB, 37.7 GB, and 31.6 GB, respectively. Loading times varied due to a
      variety of differences among the systems. Loading time also depended on whether
      data were written to intermediate files or not, and on whether input files were
      processed in sequence or in parallel. Disk-space utilization depended on the
      number of MEDLINE files processed, amount of indexing, and whether abstracts were
      stored as character large objects or truncated. CONCLUSIONS: Relational database 
      (RDBMS) technology supports indexing and querying of very large datasets, and can
      accommodate a locally stored version of MEDLINE. RDBMS systems support a wide
      range of queries and facilitate certain tasks that are not directly supported by 
      the application programming interface to PubMed. Because there is variation in
      hardware, software, and network infrastructures across sites, we cannot predict
      the exact time required for a user to load MEDLINE, but our results suggest that 
      performance of the software is reasonable. Our database schemas and conversion
      software are publicly available at http://biotext.berkeley.edu.
