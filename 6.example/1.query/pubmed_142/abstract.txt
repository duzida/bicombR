Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells form angiogenesis‑independent
vessel‑like structures to survive, known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM),
contributing to a poor prognosis for cancer patients. Nuclear localized class I
histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzymes, particularly HDACs 1, 2, 3 deacetylate
chromatin histones, are overexpressed in cancers and epigenetically regulate the 
expression of genes involved in cancer initiation and progression. The specific
HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, has been shown to attenuate tumor progression and
metastasis in TNBC. In this study, we hypothesized that entinostat would enhance 
the expression of anti‑angiogenic and tumor suppressor genes and would thus
suppress VM structures in TNBC cells in a 3D Matrigel cell culture preclinical
model. Our data indicated that invasive triple‑negative MDA‑MB‑231, LM2‑4 and
BT‑549 breast cancer cells, but not poorly invasive luminal MCF‑7 cells,
efficiently underwent matrix‑associated VM formation. Approximately 80% of TNBC
cells with the stem cell phenotype potential formed vessel‑like structures when
mixed with Matrigel and cultured in the low attachment tissue culture plate. The 
molecular mechanisms of VM formation are rather complex, while angiogenesis
inhibitor genes are downregulated and pro‑angiogenesis genes are upregulated in
VM‑forming cells. Our data revealed that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells
with entinostat epigenetically led to the re‑expression of the anti‑angiogenic
genes, serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1) and thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), and to
that of the tumor suppressor genes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and
p21, and reduced VM structures. We also found that treatment of the TNBC VM
phenotype cells with entinostat downregulated the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor A (VEGF‑A), and that of the epithelial‑mesenchymal
transition (EMT)‑related genes, Vimentin and β‑catenin. METABIRC and TCGA breast 
cancer cohort mRNA expression data analysis revealed that a high expression of
the anti‑angiogenesis‑associated genes, THBS2, SERPINF1 and serpin family B
member 5 (SERPINB5), and of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, was associated with 
a better overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients. Taken together, the
findings of this study demonstrate that HDACs 1, 2, 3 partly contribute to VM
formation in TNBC cells; thus, HDACs may be an important therapeutic target for
TNBC.

Treatment options are limited for patients with triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Understanding genes that participate in cancer progression and DNA damage
response (DDR) may improve therapeutic strategies for TNBC. DAXX, a death
domain-associated protein, has been reported to be critically involved in cancer 
progression and drug sensitivity in multiple cancer types. However, its role in
breast cancer, especially for TNBC, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated a
tumor suppressor function of DAXX in TNBC proliferation, colony formation, and
migration. In Mouse Xenograft Models, DAXX remarkably inhibited tumorigenicity of
TNBC cells. Mechanistically, DAXX could directly bind to the promoter region of
RAD51 and impede DNA damage repair, which impacted the protection mechanism of
tumor cells that much depended on remaining DDR pathways for cell growth.
Furthermore, DAXX-mediated inefficient DNA damage repair could sensitize
BRCA-proficient TNBC cells to PARP inhibitors. Additionally, we identified that
dual RAD51 and PARP inhibition with RI-1 and ABT888 significantly reduced TNBC
growth both in vitro and in vivo, which provided the first evidence of combining 
RAD51 and PARP inhibition in BRCA-proficient TNBC. In conclusion, our data
support DAXX as a modulator of DNA damage repair and suppressor of TNBC
progression to sensitize tumors to the PARP inhibitor by repressing RAD51
functions. These provide an effective strategy for a better application of PARP
inhibition in the treatment of TNBC.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cross-talk between BRCA1-IRIS (IRIS)-overexpressing
(IRISOE) TNBC cells and tumor-resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that
triggers the aggressiveness or elimination of IRISOE TNBC tumors.
METHODS: We analyzed the effect of silencing or inactivating IRIS on the
bi-directional interaction between IRISOE TNBC cells and MSCs on tumor formation 
and progression. We analyzed the downstream signaling in MSCs induced by IL-6
secreted from IRISOE TNBC cells. We compared the effect of MSCs on the formation 
and progression of IRIS-proficient and deficient-TNBC cells/tumors using in vitro
and in vivo models. Finally, we analyzed the association between IL-6, PTGER2,
and PTGER4 overexpression and breast cancer subtype; hormone receptor status; and
distant metastasis-free or overall survival.
RESULTS: We show high-level IL-6 secreted from IRISOE TNBC cells that enhances
expression of its receptor (IL-6R) in MSCs, their proliferation, and migration
toward IRISOE, in vitro, and recruitment into IRISOE TNBC tumors, in vivo. In
serum-free medium, recombinant IL-6 and the IL-6-rich IRISOE TNBC cell condition 
media (CM) decreased STAT3Y705 phosphorylation (p-STAT3Y705) in MSCs. Inhibiting 
IRIS expression or activity prolonged STAT3Y705 phosphorylation in MSCs. The
interaction with IRISOE TNBC cells skewed MSC differentiation toward
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-secreting pro-aggressiveness cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs). Accordingly, co-injecting human or mouse MSCs with IRISOE
TNBC tumor cells promoted the formation of aggressive mammary tumors, high
circulating IL-6 and PGE2 levels, and reduced overall survival. In contrast,
IRIS-silenced or inactivated cells showed reduced tumor formation ability,
limited MSC recruitment into tumors, reduced circulating IL-6 and PGE2 levels,
and prolonged overall survival. A positive correlation between IL-6, PTGER2, and 
PTGER4 expression and basal phenotype; ER-negativity; distant metastasis-free and
overall survival in basal; or BRCAmutant carriers was observed. Finally, the
bi-directional interaction with MSCs triggered death rather than growth of
IRIS-silenced TNBC cells, in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The IL-6/PGE2-positive feedback loop between IRISOE TNBC tumor cells
and MSCs enhances tumor aggressiveness. Inhibiting IRIS expression limits TNBC
tumor growth and progression through an MSC-induced death of
IRIS-silenced/inactivated TNBC cells.

NRON mediates the degradation of tat protein to participate in HIV-1 infection.
Interesting, our study observed the downregulation of NRON in triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) tissues compared with paired adjacent healthy tissues. In
contrast, lncRNA snaR was upregulated in TNBC tissues and was inversely
correlated with NRON. Expression levels of snaR increased, while expression
levels of NRON decreased along with the increase of clinical stages. snaR
overexpression resulted in promoted cancer cell proliferation but did not
significantly affect NRON expression. NRON overexpression inhibited cancer cell
proliferation and downregulated snaR. SnaR overexpression reduced the effects of 
NRON overexpression. We therefore conclude that NRON may downregulate lncRNA snaR
to inhibit cancer cell proliferation in TNBC.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast
cancer that harbors enriched cancer stem cell (CSC) populations in tumors.
Conventional chemotherapy is a standard treatment for TNBC, but it spares the CSC
populations, which cause tumor recurrence and progression. Therefore,
identification of the core molecular pathway that controls CSC activity and
expansion is essential for developing effective therapeutics for TNBC. In this
study, we identify that USP2 deubiquitinating enzyme is upregulated in CSCs and
is a novel regulator of CSCs. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of USP2
substantially inhibits the self-renewal, expansion and chemoresistance of CSCs.
We show that USP2 maintains the CSC population by activating self-renewing factor
Bmi1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through Twist upregulation.
Mechanistically, USP2 promotes Twist stabilization by removing β-TrCP-mediated
ubiquitination of Twist. Animal studies indicate that pharmacological inhibition 
of USP2 suppresses tumor progression and sensitizes tumor responses to
chemotherapy in TNBC. Furthermore, the histological analyses reveal a positive
correlation between USP2 upregulation and lymph node metastasis. Our findings
together demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of USP2 in mediating Twist
activation and CSC enrichment, suggesting that targeting USP2 is a novel
therapeutic strategy to tackle TNBC.

The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a more aggressive
nature and poorer prognosis, nowadays none pharmaceutical approach is still
available. For this reason, the research of new active compounds and attractive
targets represents an interesting field. In this context MDA- MB-231 cell line
was selected to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of new
[1,2-a]-pyrroloquinoxaline derivatives. The MTT assay revealed that the amine
forms of synthesized molecules were more active compared to iminic ones at 72 h
of incubation. The antiproliferative effect of the most promising compounds
highlighted the formation of autophagic vacuoles.

Recent studies showed that Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN), a lipogenic enzyme
overexpressed in several carcinomas, plays an important role in drug resistance. 
Furthermore, the enrichment of Breast Cancer Stem Cell (BCSC) features has been
found in breast tumors that progressed after chemotherapy. Hence, we used the
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 (231) to evaluate the
FASN and BCSC population role in resistance acquisition to chemotherapy. For this
reason, parental cell line (231) and its derivatives resistant to doxorubicin
(231DXR) and paclitaxel (231PTR) were used. The Mammosphere-Forming Assay and
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity assay showed an increase in BCSCs
in the doxorubicin-resistant model. Moreover, the expression of some
transcription factors involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
process that confers BCSC characteristics, was upregulated after chemotherapy
treatment. FASN inhibitors C75, (-)-Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), and its
synthetic derivatives G28, G56 and G37 were used to evaluate the effect of FASN
inhibition on the BCSC-enriched population in our cell lines. G28 showed a
noticeable antiproliferative effect in adherent conditions and, interestingly, a 
high mammosphere-forming inhibition capacity in all cell models. Our preliminary 
results highlight the importance of studying FASN inhibitors for the treatment of
TNBC patients, especially those who progress after chemotherapy.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer of
heterogeneous nature that is negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR) and growth factor human epidermal 2 (HER2) following
immunohistochemical analysis. TNBC is frequently characterized by relapse and
reduced survival. To date, there is no targeted therapy for this type of cancer. 
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery remain as the standard treatments
options. The lack of a target therapy and the heterogeneity of TNBC highlight the
need to seek new therapeutic options. In this study, fresh tissue samples of TNBC
were analyzed with a panel of 48 driver genes (212 amplicons) that are likely to 
be therapeutic targets. We found intron variants, missense, stop gained and
splicing variants in TP53, PIK3CA and FLT3 genes. Interestingly, all the analyzed
samples had at least two variants in the TP53 gene, one being a drug response
variant, rs1042522, found in 94% of our samples. We also found seven additional
variants not previously reported in the TP53 gene, to the best of our knowledge, 
with probable deleterious characteristics of the tumor suppressor gene. We found 
four genetic variants in the PIK3CA gene, including two missense variants. The
rs2491231 variant in the FLT3 gene was identified in 84% (16/19) of the samples, 
which not yet reported for TNBC, to the best of our knowledge. In conclusion,
genetic variants in TP53 were found in all TNBC tumors, with rs1042522 being the 
most frequent (94% of TNBC biopsies), which had not been previously reported in
TNBC. Also, we found two missense variants in the PIK3CA gene. These results
justify the validation of these genetic variants in a large cohort, as well as
the extensive study of their impact on the prognosis and therapy management of
TBNC.

Currently, there are no effective therapies for patients with triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive and highly metastatic disease. Activation of 
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) by mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (Mnk1/2) play a critical role in the
development, progression and metastasis of TNBC. Herein, we undertook a
comprehensive study to evaluate the activity of a first-in-class Mnk1/2 protein
degraders, racemic VNLG-152R and its two enantiomers (VNLG-152E1 and VNLG-152E2) 
in in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC. These studies enabled us to identify
racemic VNLG-152R as the most efficacious Mnk1/2 degrader, superior to its pure
enantiomers. By targeting Mnk1/2 protein degradation (activity), VNLG-152R
potently inhibited both Mnk-eIF4E and mTORC1 signaling pathways and strongly
regulated downstream factors involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis,
pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines secretion, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and metastasis. Most importantly, orally bioavailable VNLG-152R 
exhibited remarkable antitumor (91 to 100% growth inhibition) and antimetastatic 
(~80% inhibition) activities against cell line and patient-derived TNBC xenograft
models, with no apparent host toxicity. Collectively, these studies demonstrate
that targeting Mnk-eIF4E/mTORC1 signaling with a potent Mnk1/2 degrader,
VNLG-152R, is a novel therapeutic strategy that can be developed as monotherapy
for the effective treatment of patients with primary/metastatic TNBC.

PURPOSE: We sought to identify trends over time with respect to the use of
hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) in women with triple negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) in the national cancer database (NCDB).
METHODS: Trends in utilization of HF-WBI in women diagnosed with T1-2N0 TNBC in
the NCDB between 2008 and 2013 were analyzed. Case-matched luminal A women were
used for comparison. Variables included age, race, year of diagnosis, insurance
status, income quartile, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and institution
(academic vs. community). Chi square, logistic regression, and multivariate
analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Utilization of HF-WBI among the 53,269 TNBC women identified steadily
increased from 4.7% in 2008 to 14.0% in 2013 for women with TNBC compared to
luminal A cancer whose utilization increased from 7.3 to 23.3% over the same time
frame (p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, HF-WBI was associated with increasing 
age (p < 0.001), Medicare insurance (p < 0.001), race (p = 0.041), diagnosis
after 2011 (p < 0.001), higher income quartile (p < 0.001), and treatment at
academic institutions (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, age (p < 0.001, OR
1.038 per year), income quartile (p = 0.002, OR 1.061 per increase in quartile), 
treatment at an academic institution (p < 0.001, OR 1.78) significantly increased
use of HF-WBI.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment at an academic center and year of diagnosis were most
correlated with increased HF-WBI in T1-2N0 TNBC women in the NCDB from 2008 to
2013, followed by increasing age and income. Only 14% of T1-2N0 TNBC women
received HF-WBI in 2013. Focus on increased utilization is needed for
non-academic centers, lower income, and younger women.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Amorphophalli Rhizoma has been widely used as an 
adjuvant treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer, pancreatic cancer,
hepatoma, and malignant lymphoma, but its molecular mechanism of action for
treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally poorly 
understood.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate genomic changes related to the inhibitory effect
of Amorphophalli Rhizoma and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this
inhibition in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene chip analysis was employed to explore genomic changes
caused by Amorphophalli Rhizoma in TNBC cells. Potential classical signaling
pathways, upstream regulators, functions, regulatory effects and gene interaction
networks were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Real-time
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA interference (RNAi) assays were used to
clarify the roles of potential target genes.
RESULTS: In total, 536 significantly upregulated and 648 significantly
downregulated genes were identified between the group treated with Amorphophalli 
Rhizoma extract and that treated with vehicle. Many of these differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) in TNBC cells are involved in DNA replication,
recombination and repair, the cell cycle, and cellular assembly and organization.
Attenuation of KNL1, OLFML2A, RTKN2 and SGO1 gene expression by Amorphophalli
Rhizoma significantly induced cell cycle arrest and suppressed cell proliferation
and migration.
CONCLUSIONS: The inhibitory effects of Amorphophalli Rhizoma in TNBC cells likely
occur through regulation of the spindle checkpoint, chromosomal and centrosomal
instability, and cell membrane stability.

Tumor initiating cells (TIC) have been suggested as a mechanism for driving
chemoresistance and tumor recurrence in human cancers including triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC). Significant progress has been made in targeting TICs.
However, methods for simultaneously targeting heterogeneous TIC populations are
lacking. In this study, we found that treating TNBC cells with chemotherapeutic
agents led to a significant accumulation of the ALDH+ TIC population. Treating
TNBC cells with a disulfiram and copper mixture (DSF/Cu) specifically decreased
the ALDH+ TIC population and treatment with BKM120, a pan-PI3K inhibitor,
significantly decreased the CD44+/CD24- TIC population. Furthermore, treatment
with DSF/Cu or BKM120 induced higher levels of apoptosis in ALDH+ or CD44+/CD24- 
populations, respectively, than in bulk tumor cells. Combining DSF/Cu and BKM120 
treatment simultaneously decreased the ALDH+ and CD44+/CD24- TICs. Using a TNBC
tumor xenograft mouse model, we found that DSF/BKM in combination with Taxol
significantly reduced the tumor burden and delayed tumor recurrence compared to
Taxol treatment alone. Our study is the first of its kind to use two different
drugs to abolish two major TIC subtypes simultaneously and inhibit tumor
recurrence. These results lay a foundation for developing a novel therapy that
can improve chemotherapeutic efficacy.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for ~20% of all breast cancer
cases. The management of TNBC represents a challenge due to its aggressive
phenotype, heterogeneity and lack of targeted therapy. Loss of cell
differentiation and enrichment with breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) are
features of TNBC contributing to its aggressive nature. Here, we found that PRL
treatment of TNBC cells to significantly depletes the highly tumorigenic BCSC
subpopulations CD44+/CD24- and ALDH+ and differentiate them to the least
tumorigenic CD44-/CD24- and ALDH- phenotype with limited tumorsphere formation
and self-renewal capacities. Importantly, we found PRL to induce a
heterochromatin phenotype marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) 
and accompanied by ultrastructural cellular architecture associated with
differentiation and senescence rendering the cells refractory to growth signals. 
Crucially, we found PRL to mediate these effects in vivo in a preclinical animal 
xenograft of TNBC controlling tumor growth. These results reveal that the
lactogenic hormone PRL may exert its anti-tumorigenic effects in TNBC through
cellular reprogramming indicative of differentiation resulting in depletion of
BCSCs and restricting tumorigenesis.

BACKGROUND: Germline BRCA1/2 prevalence is relatively low in sporadic
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized that non-BRCA genes may
also have significant germline contribution to Chinese sporadic TNBC, and the
somatic mutational landscape of TNBC may vary between ethnic groups. We therefore
conducted this study to investigate germline and somatic mutations in 43 cancer
susceptibility genes in Chinese sporadic TNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six Chinese sporadic TNBC patients were enrolled in
this study. Germline and tumor DNA of each patient were subjected to
capture-based next-generation sequencing using a 43-gene panel. Standard
bioinformatic analysis and variant classification were performed to identify
deleterious/likely deleterious germline mutations and somatic mutations.
Mutational analysis was conducted to identify significantly mutated genes.
RESULTS: Deleterious/likely deleterious germline mutations were identified in 27 
(27/66, 40.9%) patients. Among the 27 patients, 9 (9/66, 13.6%) were TP53
carriers, 5 (5/66, 7.6%) were MSH6 carriers, and 5 (5/66, 7.6%) were BRCA1
carriers. Somatic mutations were identified in 64 (64/66, 97.0%) patients. TP53
somatic mutations occurred in most of the patients (45/66, 68.2%) and with
highest mean allele frequency (28.1%), while NF1 and POLE were detected to have
the highest mutation counts.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results supported our hypotheses and suggested great potentials 
of TP53 and MSH6 as novel candidates for TNBC predisposition genes. The high
frequency of somatic NF1 and POLE mutations in this study showed possibilities
for clinical benefits from androgen-blockade therapies and immunotherapies in
Chinese TNBC patients. Our study indicated necessity of multi-gene testing for
TNBC prevention and treatment.

Compared to other breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) usually
affects younger patients, is larger in size, of higher grade and is biologically 
more aggressive. To date, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the only
available treatment for TNBC because it lacks expression of the estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
and no alternative targetable molecules have been identified so far. The high
biological and clinical heterogeneity adds a further challenge to TNBC management
and requires the identification of new biomarkers to improve detection by
imaging, thus allowing the specific treatment of each individual TNBC subtype.
The Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) technique
holds great promise to the search for novel targetable biomarkers, and
aptamer-based molecular approaches have the potential to overcome obstacles of
current imaging and therapy modalities. In this review, we highlight recent
advances in oligonucleotide aptamers used as imaging and/or therapeutic agents in
TNBC, discussing the potential options to discover, image and hit new actionable 
targets in TNBC.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by lack of estrogen
receptors, progesterone hormone receptors, and HER2 overexpression, is a more
aggressive high grade tumor and not sensitive to current targeted drugs. The
clinical prognosis of TNBC is poorer than other types of breast cancer, and there
is no effective therapy strategy until now. Thus, it is necessary to determine
important factors involved in regulating the progression of TNBC. In this study, 
we found DEPDC1 was up-regulated in the tissues of TNBC compared with their
paired peritumoral tissues. DEPDC1 over-expression facilitated cell proliferation
and tumor growth through increasing the expression of FOXM1 in TNBC cells.
Conversely, knockdown of DEPDC1 had the opposite effects. Moreover, miR-26b,
acting as a tumor suppressor in TNBC, directly repressed the expression of DEPDC1
and mitigated its promotive effects on cell growth and colony formation. These
results indicate that DEPDC1, negatively regulated by miR-26b, promotes cell
proliferation and tumor growth via up-regulating FOXM1 expression, implying an
important underlying mechanism of regulating the progression of TNBC.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Metastasis is the leading cause resulting in high mortality in
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Cancer cells are skilled at
utilizing thioredoxin (Trx) system as an efficient antioxidant system to
counteract oxidative damage, facilitating the occurrence of metastasis. Here, we 
identified an organosulfur compound named DATS isolated from garlic, that
inhibits the expression of Trx-1 and the enzyme activity of Trx reductase in
breast cancer cells.
METHODS: Tissue microarray of breast cancer patients and immunohistochemical
method were used to analyze the role of Trx-1 in breast cancer metastasis.
Spotaneous metastasis model and experimental metastasis model combined with HE
staining, immunohistochemistry were used to verify in vivo anti-metastatic effect
of DATS as well as its regulation on thioredoxin. Western blot,
immunofluorescence, redox state assessment and detection of enzyme activity were 
employed to determine the effect of DATS on thioredoxin system. Trx-1 siRNA
interference was used to investigate the conclusive evidence that Trx-1 was the
target of DATS.
RESULTS: In agreement with reduced Trx-1 nuclear translocation from cytoplasm by 
DATS, the production of reduced form of Trx-1 was dramatically decreased.
Furthermore, in vivo, DATS administration was observed to significantly suppress 
spontaneous and experimental metastasis in nude mice. Delivery of DATS also
resulted in decreased expression of Trx-1 as the direct target, as well as
expression of NF-κB and MMP2/9 in primary tumor and lung tissue. Notably, the
effects of DATS on the expression of downstream metastasis-associated genes were 
mediated by Trx-1, as demonstrated by the combination use of DATS and Trx-1
siRNA.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, this present study indicates that targeting Trx system 
with DATS may provide a promising strategy for treating metastasis of TNBC.

Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) expression and collagen hydroxylation in
cancer cells are necessary for breast cancer progression. Here, we show that P4H 
alpha 1 subunit (P4HA1) protein expression is induced in triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) and HER2 positive breast cancer. By modulating alpha ketoglutarate 
(α-KG) and succinate levels P4HA1 expression reduces proline hydroxylation on
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α, enhancing its stability in cancer cells.
Activation of the P4HA/HIF-1 axis enhances cancer cell stemness, accompanied by
decreased oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.
Inhibition of P4HA1 sensitizes TNBC to the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel and
doxorubicin in xenografts and patient-derived models. We also show that increased
P4HA1 expression correlates with short relapse-free survival in TNBC patients who
received chemotherapy. These results suggest that P4HA1 promotes chemoresistance 
by modulating HIF-1-dependent cancer cell stemness. Targeting collagen P4H is a
promising strategy to inhibit tumor progression and sensitize TNBC to
chemotherapeutic agents.

Mitochondrial morphology is remodeled by continuous dynamic cycles of fission and
fusion. Emerging data have shown that the disturbance of balance between
mitochondrial fission and fusion is involved in the progression of several types 
of neoplasms. However, the status of mitochondrial dynamics and its potential
biological roles in breast cancer (BC), particularly in triple negative BC (TNBC)
are not fully clear. Here, we reported that the mitochondrial fission was
significantly increased in BC tissues, especially in the TNBC tissues, when
compared with that in the corresponding peritumor tissues. Meanwhile, our data
showed that Drp1 was upregulated, while Mfn1 was downregulated in TNBC. Moreover,
elevated mitochondrial fission was associated with poorer prognosis in TNBC
patients. Mitochondrial fission promoted the survival of TNBC cells both in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified a positive feedback loop between
mitochondrial fission and Notch signaling pathway in TNBC cells, as proved by the
experimental evidence that the activation of Notch signaling enhanced
Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission and Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in
turn promoted the activation of Notch signaling, which ultimately promoted the
cell survival of TNBC via increasing survivin expression level. Inhibition of
either Notch1 or Drp1 significantly impaired the activation of the other, leading
to the suppression of TNBC cell survival and proliferation. Collectively, our
data reveal a novel mechanism that the positive feedback loop between
mitochondrial fission and Notch signaling promotes the survival, proliferation
and apoptotic resistance of TNBC cells via increasing survivin expression and
thus favors cancer progression.

Bcl-3 is an established oncogene in diverse malignant tumors. In this study, we
investigated a dual role of Bcl-3 in BL1-subtype triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC). The BL1-subtype TNBC is featured by increasing cell cycle gene expression
and the highest sensitivity to chemotherapy among all subtypes. Bcl-3 is
associated with a better prognosis in BL1 patients. Bcl-3 knockdown in BL1 cell
MDA-MB-468 induces the inhibition of cell proliferation and the G1/S transition
arrest by promoting p27 and reducing the expressions of c-Myc and skp2 at mRNA
and protein levels. Meanwhile, Bcl-3 enhances the sensitivity of MDA-MB-468 to
chemotherapeutics ABX and PTX. Furthermore, the regulation mechanisms are
restricted to BL1 cell and do not occur in SUM159PT, a typical MSL subtype of
TNBC cell. These data suggest that Bcl-3 may be a potential clinical biomarker
for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with BL1-subtype TNBC.

The tumor suppressor Hippo pathway negatively regulates the transcriptional
coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with
PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) to inhibit cell growth and control organ size, whereas
activation of YAP and TAZ is implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis.
Here, we report that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 positively regulates
TAZ and YAP transcriptional activity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We 
found that inhibition of PYK2 expression or its kinase activity substantially
affects the steady-state level of TAZ and markedly facilitates its proteasomal
degradation. This effect was specific to PYK2 inhibition and was not obtained by 
inhibition of FAK. Destabilization of TAZ was associated with profound effect of 
PYK2 inhibition on cell growth at low-density concomitant with reduced expression
of TAZ-target genes and induction of cell apoptosis. We further show that PYK2
enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of both TAZ and LATS1/2 and concomitantly
TAZ stability, and that PYK2 protein level correlates with the level of TAZ
protein in primary breast tumors. Together these observations suggest that PYK2
is an important regulator of the Hippo pathway, and its tyrosine kinase activity 
has a striking effect on TAZ stabilization and activation in TNBC.

Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) are implicated in cancer recurrence and
metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We have recently discovered
that ganglioside GD2 expression defines BCSCs and that ST8SIA1 regulates GD2
expression and BCSC function. In this report, we show that ST8SIA1 is highly
expressed in primary TNBC; its expression is positively correlated with the
expression of several BCSC-associated genes such as BCL11A, FOXC1, CXCR4, PDGFRβ,
SOX2, and mutations in p53. CRISPR knockout of ST8SIA1 completely inhibited BCSC 
functions, including in vitro tumorigenesis and mammosphere formation.
Mechanistic studies discovered activation of the FAK-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway
in GD2+ BCSCs, and its tight regulation by ST8SIA1. Finally, knockout of ST8SIA1 
completely blocked in vivo tumor growth and metastasis by TNBC cells. In summary,
these data demonstrate the mechanism by which ST8SIA1 regulates tumor growth and 
metastasis in TNBC and identifies it as a novel therapeutic target.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype characterized by
extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. To investigate the underlying biology, we
conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of >1500 cells from six primary 
TNBC. Here, we show that intercellular heterogeneity of gene expression programs 
within each tumor is variable and largely correlates with clonality of inferred
genomic copy number changes, suggesting that genotype drives the gene expression 
phenotype of individual subpopulations. Clustering of gene expression profiles
identified distinct subgroups of malignant cells shared by multiple tumors,
including a single subpopulation associated with multiple signatures of treatment
resistance and metastasis, and characterized functionally by activation of
glycosphingolipid metabolism and associated innate immunity pathways. A novel
signature defining this subpopulation predicts long-term outcomes for TNBC
patients in a large cohort. Collectively, this analysis reveals the functional
heterogeneity and its association with genomic evolution in TNBC, and uncovers
unanticipated biological principles dictating poor outcomes in this disease.

The identification of early breast cancer patients who may benefit from adjuvant 
chemotherapy has evolved to include assessment of clinicopathologic features such
as tumor size and nodal status, as well as several gene-expression profiles for
ER-positive, HER2-negative cancers. However, these tools do not reliably identify
patients at the greatest risk of recurrence. The mutation and copy-number
landscape of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes defined by gene
expression is also largely unknown, and elucidation of this landscape may shed
light on novel therapeutic opportunities. The USO01062 phase III clinical trial
of standard chemotherapy (with or without capecitabine) enrolled a cohort of
putatively high-risk patients based on clinical features, yet only observed a
5-year disease-free survival event rate of 11.6%. In order to uncover genomic
aberrations associated with recurrence, a targeted next-generation sequencing
panel was used to compare tumor specimens from patients who had a recurrence
event with a matched set who did not. The somatic mutation and copy-number
alteration landscapes of high-risk early breast cancer patients were
characterized and alterations associated with relapse were identified. Tumor
mutational burden was evaluated but was not prognostic in this study, nor did it 
correlate with PDL1 or CD8 gene expression. However, TNBC subtypes had
substantial genomic heterogeneity with a distinct pattern of genomic alterations 
and putative underlying driver mutations. IMPLICATIONS: The present study
uncovers a compendium of genomic alterations with utility to more precisely
identify high-risk patients for adjuvant trials of novel therapeutic agents.

Whole exome sequencing in triple negative breast cancer cases (n = 8) and
targeted sequencing in healthy controls (n = 48) revealed BRIP1 rs552752779 (MAF:
75% vs. 6.25%, OR 45.00, 95% CI 9.43-243.32), ERBB2 rs527779103 (MAF: 62.5% vs.
7.29%, OR 21.19, 95% CI 5.11-94.32), ERCC2 rs121913016 (MAF: 56.25% vs. 7.29%, OR
16.34, 95% CI 4.02-70.41), MSH6 rs2020912 (MAF: 56.25% vs. 1.04%, OR 122.13, 95% 
CI 12.29-2985.48) as risk factors for triple negative breast cancer. Construction
of classification and regression tree followed by smart pruning identified MSH6
and BRIP1 variants as the major determinants of TNBC (Triple Negative Breast
Cancer) risk. Except for ERBB2, all other genes regulate DNA repair and
chromosomal integrity. In TNBC cases, two likely pathogenic variations i.e. NCOR1
rs562300336 and PIM1 rs746748226 were observed at frequencies of 18.75% and
12.5%, respectively. Among the 24 variants of unknown significance, MMP9
rs199676062, SYNE1 rs368709678, AURKA rs373550419, ABCC4 rs11568694 have variant 
allele frequency ≥ 62.5%. These genes regulate metastasis, nuclear modeling, cell
cycle and cellular detoxification, respectively. To conclude, aberrations in DNA 
mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair or BRCA1 associated genome
surveillance mechanism contribute towards triple negative breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the importance of chemotherapy in the treatment of early
stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), no one optimal regimen has been
identified. We conducted a pilot trial comparing outcomes for the three most
commonly used chemotherapy regimens to assess the feasibility of conducting a
larger definitive trial.
METHODS: Using integrated consent, newly diagnosed TNBC patients were randomised 
to one of three standard regimens: dose-dense doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide then
paclitaxel, doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide then weekly paclitaxel or
5-FU-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide then docetaxel. Feasibility endpoints included; 
physician engagement, accrual rates, physician compliance and patient
satisfaction with the integrated consent model. Our anticipated pilot trial
sample size was 35 randomised patients in one year.
RESULTS: Between August 30th, 2016 and January 31st 2017, 2 patients met
eligibility and were randomised. A survey of 10 participating oncologists was
performed to identify potential strategies to enhance accrual. Most investigators
(9/10) believed that the best regimen for TNBC was unknown, and 4/10 felt this
was a pressing clinical question. Physicians' responses suggested that poor
accrual was due to: a lack of interest in some study arms as oncologists already 
had a preferred regimen (4/10) and concerns about trial demands in busy clinics
(3/10). The pilot feasibility endpoints were not met and the study was closed.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial interest in the trial question and multiple
investigators agreeing to approach patients, this trial failed to meet
feasibility endpoints. The reasons for poor accrual were multiple and require
further evaluation if this important patient-centred question is to be answered.

The importance of BET protein BRD4 in gene transcription is well recognized
through the study of chemical modulation of its characteristic tandem bromodomain
(BrD) binding to lysine-acetylated histones and transcription factors. However,
while monovalent inhibition of BRD4 by BET BrD inhibitors such as JQ1 blocks
growth of hematopoietic cancers, it is much less effective generally in solid
tumors. Here, we report a thienodiazepine-based bivalent BrD inhibitor, MS645,
that affords spatially constrained tandem BrD inhibition and consequently
sustained repression of BRD4 transcriptional activity in blocking proliferation
of solid-tumor cells including a panel of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
cells. MS645 blocks BRD4 binding to transcription enhancer/mediator proteins MED1
and YY1 with potency superior to monovalent BET inhibitors, resulting in
down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and genes for cell-cycle control and
DNA damage repair that are largely unaffected by monovalent BrD inhibition. Our
study suggests a therapeutic strategy to maximally control BRD4 activity for
rapid growth of solid-tumor TNBC cells.

The metastatic cascade is a complex process that requires cancer cells to survive
despite conditions of high physiologic stress. Previously, cooperation between
the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) was reported
as a point of convergence for host and cellular stress signaling. These studies
indicated p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of GR on Ser134 and subsequent
p-GR/HIF-dependent induction of breast tumor kinase (PTK6/Brk), as a mediator of 
aggressive cancer phenotypes. Herein, p-Ser134 GR was quantified in human primary
breast tumors (n = 281) and the levels of p-GR were increased in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) relative to luminal breast cancer. Brk was robustly induced 
following exposure of TNBC model systems to chemotherapeutic agents (Taxol or
5-fluorouracil) and growth in suspension [ultra-low attachment (ULA)]. Notably,
both Taxol and ULA resulted in upregulation of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR), a known mediator of cancer prosurvival phenotypes. Mechanistically, AhR
and GR copurified and following chemotherapy and ULA, these factors assembled at 
the Brk promoter and induced Brk expression in an HIF-dependent manner.
Furthermore, Brk expression was upregulated in Taxol-resistant breast cancer
(MCF-7) models. Ultimately, Brk was critical for TNBC cell proliferation and
survival during Taxol treatment and in the context of ULA as well as for basal
cancer cell migration, acquired biological phenotypes that enable cancer cells to
successfully complete the metastatic cascade. These studies nominate AhR as a
p-GR binding partner and reveal ways to target epigenetic events such as adaptive
and stress-induced acquisition of cancer skill sets required for metastatic
cancer spread.Implication: Breast cancer cells enlist intracellular stress
response pathways that evade chemotherapy by increasing cancer cell survival and 
promoting migratory phenotypes. Mol Cancer Res; 16(11); 1761-72. ©2018 AACR.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death
in women. Previous studies indicated that miR-361-5p was downregulated in breast 
cancer, however, the exact effect of miR-361-5p on TNBC requires further
investigation. In the present study, we investigated whether miR-361-5p can act
as a tumor suppressor by targeting required for cell differentiation 1 homolog
(RQCD1) and inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in TNBC. The expression of
miR-361-5p and RQCD1 was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR
(qRT-PCR) and/or western blot in TNBC and the adjacent tissues. miR-361-5p mimics
were constructed and transfected to TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Cells were divided
into three groups: blank control group, miRNA mimic negative control (NC) group, 
and miR-361-5p mimics group. Expression of miR-361-5p, mRNA and protein
expression of PI3K, Akt, EGFR, phosphorylated (p)-EGFR/PI3K/Akt, and protein
expression of RQCD1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) in MDA-MB-231 were
measured by qRT-PCR/western blot after transfection. Cell viability was
determined by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration and invasion ability were evaluated by 
scratch and transwell assay, respectively. miR-361-5p target gene was determined 
by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. RQCD1 was identified as
a target of miR-361-5p by TargetScan and confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. 
Downregulated miR-361-5p and upregulated RQCD1 were observed in TNBC tissues.
Expression of EGFR, PI3K, Akt and MMP-9 was inhibited in cells treated with
miR-361-5p mimics. Transfection of miR-361-5p mimics also inhibited the
phosphorylation of EGFR, PI3K, and Akt. Suppressed cell viability, migration, and
invasion was found in miR-361-5p mimics groups. Our results indicated that
overexpression of miR-361-5p might act as a suppressor in TNBC by targeting RQCD1
to inhibit the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

The major hallmarks of tumor progression are angiogenesis, migration and
metastasis. Among the components of Rhodiola rosea, salidroside
(p‑hydroxyphenethyl-β‑d-glucoside) is one of the most potent, and is present in
all Rhodiola species. Recent data have revealed the anticancer effects of
salidroside; however, the mechanism underlying its ability to inhibit tumor
angiogenesis remains unknown. The present study aimed to analyze how salidroside 
affects major factors involved in breast cancer, and to elucidate its ability to 
inhibit angiogenesis and invasion. Signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) is a marker for tumor angiogenesis and migration, which
interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Specifically, MMPs act as a
downstream target for STAT3. Using western blotting and reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, the present study 
demonstrated that treatment of MDA‑MB 231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
cells with salidroside led to inhibition of invasion and migration markers, and
of STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, in vitro angiogenesis analyses in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells confirmed the anti-angiogenic activity of
salidroside. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay also demonstrated that
salidroside may inhibit the DNA-binding activity of STAT3, preventing STAT3 from 
binding to a novel binding site of the MMP2 gene promoter. In conclusion, the
present results demonstrated that salidroside may downregulate the STAT3
signaling pathway, and inhibit cell viability, migration and invasion through
MMPs in breast cancer cells.

An Immunosuppressive Role for Eya3 in TNBC.

[No authors listed]

A recent study indicates that the protein Eya3 influences the adaptive immune
response to promote tumor growth, not only decreasing the number of
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, but also driving their exhaustion through PD-L1 
upregulation. These findings could spur new strategies to treat triple-negative
breast cancer, which currently lacks targeted therapies.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast
cancer in which the cell surface lacks usual targets for drug to exhibit its
effects. Epirubicin (Epi) is widely used for TNBC, but a substantial number of
patients develop Epi resistance that is usually associated with poor prognosis.
Transforming growth factor (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine. In recent
study, it appears that TGF-β influences the cancer stem cell population, thus,
the drug resistance of cancer may also be affected. We used epirubicin to treat
MDA-MB-231 (MB-231) cells and found that TGF-β and breast cancer stem cell
markers CD44+CD24- were increased and were dose-dependent of epirubicin. We
established drug-resistant cell line from parental MB-231 cells by chronic
treatment with low-concentration epirubicin. The MB-231/Epi cell line showed
relatively slow growth rate with varied morphology. Transwell assay and drug
sensitivity assay revealed that the malignant cell behaviors in terms of
migration, invasion and epirubicin-resistant properties were markedly increased
in the MB-231/Epi cells. Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, and flow
cytometry were used to analyze the expression levels of the breast cancer stem
cell markers, CD44 and CD24. Mammospheres assay showed that the stemness of
MB-231/Epi was increased compared to their parental cells. Interestingly,
MB-231/Epi cells showed different expression levels of apoptosis-related markers:
Bcl2, Bax; EMT-related markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin and cell cycle-related
marker cyclinD1. These genes have all been shown to be regulated by the TGF-β
pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that TGF-β plays a vital role in
TNBC epirubicin-resistance through regulating stemness, EMT and apoptosis.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression and function of insulin-like growth factor
II (IGFII) mRNA binding protein (IMP3) in the Triple Negative Breast Cancer
(TNBC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to previously reported gene expression array, we
found that IMP3 had significantly higher expression in the CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell
cluster, tumor initiating cell or cancer stem cell (CSCs), compared to other
tumor cells. Based on the GEO database (GEO accession No. GSE6883), we detected
the mRNA levels of IMP 1,2 and 3 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(q-PCR) in CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster and other breast tumor cell clusters.
Besides, we measured IMP3 expression in microsphere of breast cancer, which
exerted more significant tumor stem cell properties. The effects of IMP3 on
breast cancer cell stem cell properties were studied by RNA interference and
overexpression approaches in vitro. Furthermore, we predicted and identified
microRNA, which could target and regulate IMP3 from bioinformatics analysis, and 
verified the interaction by luciferase assays and rescue experiments.
RESULTS: Previously reported data showed that IMP3 expression was significantly
upregulated in CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster from breast cancer tissues. Besides,
we found IMP3 had higher expression in mesenchymal cells rather than epithelial
cells, which was also significantly elevated in SUM159 and T49D cell lines
cultured as microsphere rather than adherent cells or differentiated cells.
CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster proportion was significantly decreased after
silencing IMP3 in SUM1315, and its ability to develop into microsphere was
significantly inhibited. By re-expressing IMP3 in SUM315, we restored the
self-renewal capacity and tumorigenesis potential of SUM315. Through relative
predicting website, we found several miRNAs which could regulate IMP3. miR-34a
with highest score was chosen for further analysis. Mimicking miR-34a
significantly downregulated IMP3 expression and inhibited its ability to develop 
into microsphere, while overexpressing IMP3 could rescue this process.
CONCLUSIONS: IMP3 plays a vital role in maintaining stem cell properties of
breast cancer cells, which could be regulated by mir-34a.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a long-lasting orphan disease in terms of
little therapeutic progress during the past several decades and still the
standard of care remains chemotherapy. Experimental discovery of molecular
signatures including the 'BRCAness' highlighted the innate heterogeneity of TNBC,
generating the diversity of TNBC phenotypes. As it contributes to enhancing
genomic instability, it has widened the therapeutic spectrum of TNBC. In
particular, unusual sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was denoted in patients
with BRCA deficiency, suggesting therapeutic benefit from platinum and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, regardless of enriched
chemosensitivity and immunogenicity, majority of patients with TNBC still suffer 
from dismal clinical outcomes including early relapse and metastatic spread.
Therefore, efforts into more precise and personalised treatment are critical at
this point. Accordingly, the advance of multiomics has revealed novel actionable 
targets including PI3K-Akt-mTOR and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling
pathways, which might actively participate in modulating the chemosensitivity and
immune system. Also, TNBC has long been considered a potential protagonist of
immunotherapy in breast cancer, supported by abundant tumour-infiltrating
lymphocytes and heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Despite that, earlier
studies showed somewhat unsatisfactory results of monotherapy with
immune-checkpoint inhibitors, consistently durable responses in responders were
noteworthy. Based on these results, further combinatorial trials either with
other chemotherapy or targeted agents are underway. Incorporating
immune-molecular targets into combination as well as refining the standard
chemotherapy might be the key to unlock the future of TNBC. In this review, we
share the current and upcoming treatment options of TNBC in the framework of
scientific and clinical data, especially focusing on early stage of TNBC.

Nowadays, risk factors of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis are not
well identified. Our present study reveals that an industrial chemical, bisphenol
S (BPS), can promote the migration, but not the proliferation, of TNBC cells in
vitro. BPS activates YAP, a key effector of Hippo pathway, by inhibiting its
phosphorylation, which promotes YAP nuclear accumulation and up-regulates its
downstream genes such as CTGF and ANKRD1. Inhibition of YAP blocks the
BPS-triggered cell migration and up-regulation of fibronectin (FN) and vimentin
(Vim). BPS rapidly decreases the phosphorylation levels of LATS1 (Ser909) in TNBC
cells, which regulates the activation and functions of YAP. Silencing LATS1/2 by 
siRNA increases BPS-induced dephosphorylation of YAP and extended the half-life
of YAP protein. Inhibition of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) and
its downstream PLCβ/PKC signals attenuate the effects of BPS-induced YAP
dephosphorylation and CTGF up-regulation. Targeted inhibition of GPER/YAP
inhibits BPS-induced migration of TNBC cells. Collectively, we reveal that
GPER/Hippo-YAP signal is involved in BPS-induced migration of TNBC cells.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) still remains a challenge to treat in the
clinic due to a lack of good targets for treatment. Although TNBC lacks
expression of ERα, the expression of ERβ and its variants are detected quite
frequently in this cancer type and can represent an avenue for treatment. We show
that two of the variants of ERβ, namely ERβ2 and ERβ5, control aggressiveness of 
TNBC by regulating hypoxic signaling through stabilization of HIF-1α. RNA-seq of 
patient derived xenografts (PDX) from TNBC shows expression of ERβ2, ERβ4 and
ERβ5 variants in more than half of the samples. Furthermore, expression of ERβ4
in the immortalized, normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A that is
resistant to tumorsphere formation caused transformation and development of
tumorspheres. By contrast, ERβ1, ERβ2 or ERβ5 were unable to support tumorsphere 
formation. We have previously shown that all variants except ERβ1 stabilize
HIF-1α but only ERβ4 appears to have the ability to transform normal mammary
epithelial cells, pointing towards a unique property of ERβ4. We propose that ERβ
variants may be good diagnostic tools and also serve as novel targets for
treatment of breast cancer.

Any type of breast cancer not expressing genes of the estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is
referred to as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Accordingly, TNBCs do not
respond to hormonal therapies or medicines targeting the ER, PR, or HER2.
Systemic chemotherapy is therefore the only treatment option available today and 
prognoses remain poor. We report the discovery and characterization of
N-(naphtho[1,2-b]furan-5-yl)benzenesulfonamides as selective inhibitors of TNBCs.
These inhibitors were identified by virtual screening and inhibited different
TNBC cell lines with IC50 values of 2-3 μM. The compounds did not inhibit normal 
(i.e. MCF-7 and MCF-10A) cells in vitro, indicating their selectivity against
TNBC cells. Considering the selectivity of these inhibitors for TNBC, these
compounds and analogs can serve as a promising starting point for further
research on effective TNBC inhibitors.

Obesity is associated with poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Preclinical models of TNBC were used to test the hypothesis that
increased leptin signaling drives obesity-associated TNBC development by
promoting cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice, which develop spontaneous
basal-like, triple-negative mammary tumors, received either a control diet (10%
kcal from fat) or a diet-induced obesity regimen (DIO, 60% kcal from fat) for up 
to 42 weeks (n = 15/group). Mice were monitored for tumor development and
euthanized when tumor diameter reached 1.5 cm. Tumoral gene expression was
assessed via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). DIO mice had greater body weight and
percent body fat at termination than controls. DIO mice, versus controls,
demonstrated reduced survival, increased systemic metabolic and inflammatory
perturbations, upregulated tumoral CSC/EMT gene signature, elevated tumoral
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (a CSC marker), and greater leptin signaling. In 
cell culture experiments using TNBC cells (murine: E-Wnt and M-Wnt; human:
MDA-MB-231), leptin enhanced mammosphere formation, and media supplemented with
serum from DIO versus control mice increased cell viability, migration, invasion,
and CSC- and EMT-related gene expression, including Foxc2, Twist2, Vim, Akt3, and
Sox2 In E-Wnt cells, knockdown of leptin receptor ablated these procancer effects
induced by DIO mouse serum. These findings indicate that increased leptin
signaling is causally linked to obesity-associated TNBC development by promoting 
CSC enrichment and EMT.Implications: Leptin-associated signals impacting CSC and 
EMT may provide new targets and intervention strategies for decreasing TNBC
burden in obese women. Mol Cancer Res; 16(5); 869-79. ©2018 AACR.

Advances in cancer immunotherapy and a growing body of research have focused on
the role of the antitumor response in breast cancer. Triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) is the most immunogenic breast cancer subtype, and there is strong 
evidence that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in TNBC have prognostic value and
are associated with clinical outcome and improved survival. Evading antitumor
immunity is a hallmark for the development and progression of cancer.
Immunotherapy studies have focused on the role of the programmed cell death-1
(PD-1) receptor/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway in maintaining
immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis 
has emerged as a promising therapeutic option to enhance antitumor immunity and
is actively being investigated in TNBC, with encouraging results. In this
article, the authors review the current literature on checkpoint inhibitors in
TNBC with a focus on PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and discuss combination strategies and
novel approaches for improving antitumor immunity and clinical outcome. Cancer

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an aggressive clinical behaviour, with a
poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Recently, tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) have been proposed as a predictive biomarker for a better
clinical outcome and pathological response (pR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NACT) in TNBC. These data confirm the role of the immune system in the
neoplastic progression and in the response to therapy. We performed a
retrospective analysis of 54 pre-NACT biopsies of TNBC and compared both the
percentage of stromal TILs and the degree of PD-L1 expression with the extent of 
pR to standard NACT. A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 35%
of cases. Univariate analysis showed (i) a significant association between PD-L1 
expression in ≥25% of neoplastic cells and the achievement of a pCR (p = 0.024); 
(ii) a significantly higher frequency of pCR in cases showing ≥50% stromal TILs
(p < 0.001). However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor 
cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27),
suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a
subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to 
be confirmed by larger studies.

The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept is currently employed to explain the mechanism
of multidrug resistance that is implicated in the reduced efficacy of many
chemotherapeutic agents, consequently leading to metastatic spread and disease
relapse. We searched for potential predictive markers of doxorubicin (DOX)
resistance in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) of the BT-549 human
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line classified as a claudin-low
subtype. In this study, we show that BT-549 presents a BCSCs-like subset
determined by a CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH1+ phenotype. The
CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH+ BCSCs-like subset presented the downregulation of a
majority of the genes analyzed (64 genes), and only 3 genes were upregulated
after DOX treatment. Among the upregulated genes, MAPK3, PRKCZ and STAT3, STAT3
presented a higher level of upregulation in the DOX-treated
CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH+ BCSCs-like subset. The identification of biomarkers
that predict antitumor responses is at the top of cancer research priorities.
STAT3 was highlighted as a molecular signature in the CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH1+
BCSCs-like subset obtained from the TNBC BT-549 cell line related to DOX
resistance. A majority of the evaluated genes in the EGF pathway appear to be not
associated with DOX resistance, as observed in the CD44+/high/CD24-/low/ALDH1+
BCSCs-like subset.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogenous disease with high
aggressive and poor outcome. The lack of biomarkers and targeted therapies makes 
it a challenge for the treatment of TNBC. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis)
are emerging as novel anti-tumor agents in many types of human cancers. In this
study, we found that I-7ab, a novel HDACi, inhibited the cell viability of TNBC
cells and induced the cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, I-7ab specifically
decreased the expression of HDAC3 and promoted the acetylation of p53 at both
Lys373 and Lys382 amino acids. The up-regulated acetylation of p53 promoted the
transcriptional activity of p53 and induced the expression of p21, which
consequently caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Administration of I-7ab
inhibited the colony formation of TNBC cells. Collectively, these results
indicated I-7ab as a promising anti-cancer agent in the treatment of TNBC.

BACKGROUND: Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) lack the appropriate targets
for currently used breast cancer therapies, conferring an aggressive phenotype,
more frequent relapse and poorer survival rates. The biological heterogeneity of 
TNBC complicates the clinical treatment further. We have explored and compared
the biological pathways in TNBC and other subtypes of breast cancers, using an in
silico approach and the hypothesis that two opposing effects (Yin and Yang)
pathways in cancer cells determine the fate of cancer cells. Identifying breast
subgroup specific components of these opposing pathways may aid in selecting
potential therapeutic targets as well as further classifying the heterogeneous
TNBC subtype.
METHODS: Gene expression and patient clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium
(METABRIC) were used for this study. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used
to identify the more active pathways in cancer (Yin) than in normal and the more 
active pathways in normal (Yang) than in cancer. The clustering analysis was
performed to compare pathways of TNBC with other types of breast cancers. The
association of pathway classified TNBC sub-groups to clinical outcomes was tested
using Cox regression model.
RESULTS: Among 4729 curated canonical pathways in GSEA database, 133 Yin pathways
(FDR < 0.05) and 71 Yang pathways (p-value <0.05) were discovered in TNBC. The
FOXM1 is the top Yin pathway while PPARα is the top Yang pathway in TNBC. The
TNBC and other types of breast cancers showed different pathways enrichment
significance profiles. Using top Yin and Yang pathways as classifier, the TNBC
can be further subtyped into six sub-groups each having different clinical
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: We first reported that the FOMX1 pathway is the most upregulated and 
the PPARα pathway is the most downregulated pathway in TNBC. These two pathways
could be simultaneously targeted in further studies. Also the pathway classifier 
we performed in this study provided insight into the TNBC heterogeneity.

Microarray showed that lncRNA RMST was differentially expressed in cervical
cancer. Further experiments were conducted to detect the expression and
biological function of RMST in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Microarray
was used to screen the differentially expressed lncRNAs in TNBC. QRT-PCR was
applied to uncover the expression of RMST in TNBC tissues. The cell viability of 
RMST-transfected TNBC cells were probed by CKK-8 assay and colony formation
assay. TUNEL assay was conducted to test the cell apoptosis and FCM assay was
exerted to detect the cell cycle. The invasion and migration ability of
transfected cells were examined by transwell assay. RMST played its biological
function through regulating the mRNA or protein expression in cytoplasm. CCK-8
and colony formation assay unveiled that RMST could slow down the proliferation
of TNBC cells to influence the tumor progression. TUNEL results revealed that
RMST could enhance cell apoptosis in TNBC. The cell cycle detected by FCM assay
indicated that RMST might induce the block of G0/G1 phase thus inhibiting TNBC
cell proliferation. RMST overexpression could also restrain the invasion and
migration abilities of TNBC cells. RMST played a role of tumor suppressor in TNBC
through inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion and migration, enhancing cell
apoptosis, and regulating cell cycle.

Claudin-6 (CLDN6), a critical tight junction protein acting as a tumor suppressor
in breast cancer, is also considered to be a stem cell marker. Triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of claudin-low and stem cell-like breast cancer
which is chemoresistant to multiple anti-cancer drugs. The aim of our study was
to determine whether CLDN6 plays a role in chemoresistance of TNBC. We found that
overexpression of CLDN6 in TNBC cell line MDAMB231 significantly inhibited cell
growth, migration, and invasion. The expression of CLDN6 increased the IC50 of
adriamycin (ADM) and promoted the clonogenic survival. CLDN6 inhibited
ADM-induced apoptosis and senescence in MDAMB231 cells. However, P-gp, a
resistance-related protein highly associated with chemoresistance, was
downregulated by CLDN6 overexpression in MDAMB231 cells. Epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT) marker E-cadherin was increased, and vimentin was decreased by
CLDN6. In addition, stem cell markers OCT4, SOX2, and Nanog were dramatically
increased. CLDN6 colocalized and interacted with AF-6. Overexpression of CLDN6
increased the expression of afadin (AF-6) and hampered the activation of ERK
signaling. PMA, a specific ERK activator, reversed the expression of EMT and stem
cell markers, and decreased chemoresistance of MDAMB231 cells to ADM with a
decreased IC50 and an increased apoptosis resulting from CLDN6. Together, we
conclude that CLDN6 enhances the chemoresistance to ADM via activating the
AF-6/ERK signaling pathway and up-regulating cancer stem cell characters in
MDAMB231 cells.

Few reports in literature describe triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) imaging
findings. Aim of the study is to determine MR-features of TNBC compared to
receptor positive cancer (nTNBC). From May 2014 to May 2015, we retrospectively
enrolled 31 consecutive patients with histological diagnosis of TNBC and a
control group of 31 consecutive nTNBC observed in the same period, out of 602
cancer, diagnosed in our department in the same year. Histopathological analysis 
and MR-features of TNBC (31 patients) were compared to nTNBC (31 patients).
MR-features included dimension, fibroglandular tissue (FGT), background
parenchimal enhancement (BPE), mass shape, margins, presence of rim, intratumoral
signal intensity in T2w, uni-multifocality, kinetic curves. All patients were
examined with MR 1,5T (Magnetom Simphony Tim, Siemens Healthcare) performing T2w 
fat-sat and contrast enhanced high temporal and spatial resolution T1w before and
after injection of Gadolinium. 62 staging MR were reviewed. Median age was 50
(30-78ys) with a standard deviation of 10,9. TNBC showed 3 MR features in
concordance with current literature: rim enhancement, hyperintensity in T2
sequence and unifocality. Rim enhancement was shown in 67.7% of TNBC (21/31) and 
29% of nTNBC (9/31). Higher T2w values were shown in 83.9% of TNBC (26/31) and
58.1% of nTNBC (18/31). Cancer was multifocal in 7/31 (22.6%) of TNBC and 19/31
(61.3%) nTNBC. No correlation was found for dimension (p=0.12), FGT (p=0.959),
BPE (p=0.596), homogeneity of enhancement (p=0.43), margins (p=0.671) and kinetic
(p=0.37). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that rim enhancement and unifocality
correlated independently with TNBC group. Area under ROC curve of our model is
0.835. Furthermore, we evaluated the clinical outcome of all 31 TNBC patients in 
a follow-up time ranging from 24months to 36months separating them in a
free-survival group (23 women) and a recurrence group (8 women with local
recurrence or distant metastasis): only kinetic curves resulted to be
significantly higher in recurrence group (p=0.042).

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) often
presents with a high histological grade and high malignancy, which greatly
contribute to patient morbidity and mortality. Rhizoma Amorphophalli exhibits
many biological and pharmacological activities, but its potential as a
therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic TNBC patients remains poorly
understood.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to determine whether Rhizoma
Amorphophalli inhibits metastasis in the human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CCK-8 and colony formation assays were adopted for the
analysis of cell activity and cell proliferation, respectively. Flow cytometry
was used for cell cycle analysis. Wound healing and transwell assays were
performed to assess cell migration and invasion, respectively. PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathways were analyzed through western blotting. Breast cancer cell
metastasis to the lung in a xenograft model was evaluated by in vivo fluorescence
imaging. A GC-MS analysis was performed to determine the main components of the
petroleum ether fraction from the ethanol extract of Rhizoma Amorphophalli
(abbreviated RhA).
RESULTS: RhA significantly reduced breast cancer cell viability and
proliferation. The flow cytometry analysis indicated that RhA induced MDA-MB-231 
cell arrest at the S phase. Additionally, RhA decreased MDA-MB-231 cell migration
and invasion and inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, mice
treated with RhA exhibited a significant reduction in tumor infiltration and a
decrease in breast cancer cell metastasis to the lung. The GC-MS analysis results
showed that RhA contained a large number of unsaturated fatty acids, such as
octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid), octadecatrienoic acid (linolenic acid), and
oleate, which might represent the anticancer components of the extract.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that RhA has potential as a
therapeutic candidate for metastatic TNBC treatment.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a metastatic disease is currently
incurable. Reliable and reproducible methods for testing drugs against metastasis
are not available. Stromal cells may play a critical role in tumor progression
and metastasis. In this study, we determined that fibroblasts and macrophages
secreted IL-8 upon induction by tumor cell-conditioned media (TCM) from
MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Our data showed that the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
cells co-cultured with fibroblasts or macrophages was enhanced compared to the
monoculture. Furthermore, TNBC cell migration, a key step in tumor metastasis,
was promoted by conditioned media (CM) from TCM-induced fibroblasts or
macrophages. Knockdown of the IL-8 receptor CXCR2 by CRISPR-Cas9 reduces
MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and migration compared to wild type. In a mouse
xenograft tumor model, the growth of MDA-MB-231-CXCR2-/- tumor was significantly 
decreased compared to the growth of tumors from wild-type cells. In addition, the
incidence of thoracic metastasis of MDA-MB-231-CXCR2-/- tumors was reduced
compared to wild type. We found that the auto- and paracrine loop exists between 
TNBC cells and stroma, which results in enhanced IL-8 secretion from the stromal 
components. Significantly, inhibition of the IL-8 signaling pathway by reparixin,
an inhibitor of the IL-8 receptor, CXCR1/2, reduced MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and
metastasis. Taken together, these findings implicate IL-8 signaling as a critical
event in TNBC tumor growth and metastasis via crosstalk with stromal components.

the lack of receptors (ER, PR, HER2) and high incidence of drug resistance
associated with it, a case-control association study was conducted to identify
the contributing genetic risk factors for Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). A
total of 30 TNBC patients and 50 age and gender-matched controls of Indian origin
were screened for 9,00,000 SNP markers using microarray-based SNP genotyping
approach. The initial PLINK association analysis (p < 0.01, MAF 0.14-0.44, OR
10-24) identified 28 non-synonymous SNPs and one stop gain mutation in the exonic
region as possible determinants of TNBC risk. All the 29 SNPs were annotated
using ANNOVAR. The interactions between these markers were evaluated using
Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. The interactions were in the
following order:
exm408776 > exm1278309 > rs316389 > rs1651654 > rs635538 > exm1292477. Recursive 
partitioning analysis (RPA) was performed to construct decision tree useful in
predicting TNBC risk. As shown in this analysis, rs1651654 and exm585172 SNPs are
found to be determinants of TNBC risk. Artificial neural network model was used
to generate the Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), which showed high
sensitivity and specificity (AUC-0.94) of these markers. To conclude, among the
9,00,000 SNPs tested, CCDC42 exm1292477, ANXA3 exm408776, SASH1 exm585172 are
found to be the most significant genetic predicting factors for TNBC. The
interactions among exm408776, exm1278309, rs316389, rs1651654, rs635538,
exm1292477 SNPs inflate the risk for TNBC further. Targeted analysis of these
SNPs and genes alone also will have similar clinical utility in predicting TNBC.

PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most prevalent in young women of
African ancestry (WAA) compared to women of other ethnicities. Recent studies
found a correlation between high expression of the transcription factor Kaiso,
TNBC aggressiveness, and ethnicity. However, little is known about Kaiso
expression and localization patterns in TNBC tissues of WAA. Herein, we analyze
Kaiso expression patterns in TNBC tissues of African (Nigerian), Caribbean
(Barbados), African American (AA), and Caucasian American (CA) women.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) TNBC tissue blocks from
Nigeria and Barbados were utilized to construct a Nigerian/Barbadian tissue
microarray (NB-TMA). This NB-TMA and a commercially available TMA comprising AA
and CA TNBC tissues (AA-CA-YTMA) were subjected to immunohistochemistry to assess
Kaiso expression and subcellular localization patterns, and correlate Kaiso
expression with TNBC clinical features.
RESULTS: Nigerian and Barbadian women in our study were diagnosed with TNBC at a 
younger age than AA and CA women. Nuclear and cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was
observed in all tissues analyzed. Analysis of Kaiso expression in the NB-TMA and 
AA-CA-YTMA revealed that nuclear Kaiso H scores were significantly higher in
Nigerian, Barbadian, and AA women compared with CA women. However, there was no
statistically significant difference in nuclear Kaiso expression between Nigerian
versus Barbadian women, or Barbadian versus AA women.
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of nuclear Kaiso expression were detected in patients
with a higher degree of African heritage compared to their Caucasian
counterparts, suggesting a role for Kaiso in TNBC racial disparity.

BACKGROUND: The malignant potential of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is
also dependent on a sub-population of cells with a stem-like phenotype. Among the
cancer stem cell markers, CD133 and EpCAM strongly correlate with breast tumor
aggressiveness, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of the two surface
antigens may be beneficial in treatment of TNBC. Since in TNBC-derived cells we
demonstrated that PLC-β2 induces the conversion of CD133high to CD133low cells,
here we explored its possible role in down-modulating the expression of both
CD133 and EpCAM and, ultimately, in reducing the number of TNBC cells with a
stem-like phenotype.
METHODS: A magnetic step-by-step cell isolation with antibodies directed against 
CD133 and/or EpCAM was performed on the TNBC-derived MDA-MB-231 cell line. In the
same cell model, PLC-β2 was over-expressed or down-modulated and cell
proliferation and invasion capability were evaluated by Real-time cell assays.
The surface expression of CD133, EpCAM and CD44 in the different experimental
conditions were measured by multi-color flow cytometry immunophenotyping.
RESULTS: A CD133+/EpCAM+ sub-population with high proliferation rate and invasion
capability is present in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Over-expression of PLC-β2 in
CD133+/EpCAM+ cells reduced the surface expression of both CD133 and EpCAM, as
well as proliferation and invasion capability of this cellular subset. On the
other hand, the up-modulation of PLC-β2 in the whole MDA-MB-231 cell population
reduced the number of cells with a CD44+/CD133+/EpCAM+ stem-like phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Since selective targeting of the cells with the highest aggressive
potential may have a great clinical importance for TNBC, the up-modulation of
PLC-β2, reducing the number of cells with a stem-like phenotype, may be a
promising goal for novel therapies aimed to prevent the progression of aggressive
breast tumors.

The lack of targeted therapies available for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
patients who fail to respond to first-line chemotherapy has sparked interest in
immunotherapeutic approaches. However, trials utilizing checkpoint inhibitors
targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC have had underwhelming responses. Here, we 
investigated the interplay between type I IFN signaling and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
and tested the impact of combining IFN inducers, as immune activators, with
anti-PD-1, to induce an antimetastatic immune response. Using models of TNBC, we 
demonstrated an interplay between type I IFN signaling and tumor cell PD-L1
expression that affected therapeutic response. The data revealed that the type I 
IFN-inducer poly(I:C) was an effective immune activator and antimetastatic agent,
functioning better than anti-PD-1, which was ineffective as a single agent.
Poly(I:C) treatment induced PD-L1 expression on TNBC cells, and combined
poly(I:C) and anti-PD-1 treatment prolonged metastasis-free survival in a
neoadjuvant setting via the induction of a tumor-specific T-cell response. Use of
this combination in a late treatment setting did not impact metastasis-free
survival, indicating that timing was critical for immunotherapeutic benefit.
Together, these data demonstrated anti-PD-1 as an ineffective single agent in
preclinical models of TNBC. However, type I IFN inducers were effective immune
activators, and neoadjuvant trials combining them with anti-PD-1 to induce a
sustained antitumor immune response are warranted. Cancer Immunol Res; 5(10);

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the breast cancer subtype that
displays a high risk of early recurrence and short overall survival. Improvement 
of the prognosis of patients with TNBC requires identifying a predictive factor
of recurrence, which would make it possible to provide beneficial personalized
treatment. However, no clinically reliable predictive factor is currently known. 
In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid
profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with
recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for
phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the
recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was 
more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding
stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant
transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor
of TNBC recurrence. A future prospective study investigating whether personalized
therapy based on PC (32:1) intensity improves the prognosis of patients with TNBC
is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: There is an unmet need in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
patients for targeted therapies. Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) 
is a promising target for inhibition based on the abundance of correlative and
functional data supporting its role in various cancer types. Areas covered: This 
review endeavors to outline the role of MELK in cancer. Studies covering a range 
of biological functions including proliferation, apoptosis, cancer stem cell
phenotypes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and therapy
resistance are discussed here in order to understand the potential of MELK as a
clinically significant target for TNBC patients. Expert opinion: Targeting MELK
may offer a novel therapeutic opportunity in TNBC and other cancers. Despite the 
abundance of correlative data, there is still much we do not know. There are a
lack of potent, specific inhibitors against MELK, as well as an insufficient
understanding of MELK's downstream substrates. Addressing these issues is the
first step toward identifying a patient population that could benefit from MELK
inhibition in combination with other therapies.

Leptin (LEP) binds to the long form of the leptin receptor (LEPRb), leading to
the activation of multiple signaling pathways that are potential targets for
disrupting the obesity-breast cancer link. In triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC), LEP is hypothesized to predominantly mediate its tumorigenic effects via 
a subpopulation of LEPRb-positive tumor cells termed cancer stem cells (CSCs)
that can initiate tumors and induce tumor progression. Previously, we showed that
LEP promotes CSC survival in vivo Moreover, silencing LEPRb in TNBC cells
compromised the CSC state. The mechanisms by which LEPRb regulates TNBC CSC
intracellular signaling are not clear. We hypothesized that activation of LEPRb
signaling is sufficient to drive CSC maintenance in TNBC. Here, we show that
activation of LEPRb in non-CSCs isolated using our CSC reporter system resulted
in a transition to the stem cell state. In CSCs, LEP induced STAT3
phosphorylation, whereas LEP did not induce STAT3 phosphorylation in non-CSCs.
Introduction of constitutively active STAT3 into LEPRb-transfected non-CSCs
significantly induced NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4 expression compared with control
non-CSCs. To determine the intracellular phospho-tyrosine residue of LEPRb that
is necessary for the induction of the stem cell state in non-CSCs, we transfected
the tyrosine residue point mutants L985, F1077 and S1138 into non-CSCs. Non-CSCs 
transfected with the L985 mutant exhibited increased STAT3 phosphorylation,
increased SOCS3 expression and an induction of GFP expression compared with
non-CSCs expressing the F1077 and S1138 mutants. Our data demonstrate that
LEPRb-induced STAT3 activation is essential for the induction and maintenance of 
TNBC CSCs.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) a clinically aggressive subtype of breast
cancer with poor outcomes. Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of many TNBCs,
and likely underlies its ability to adapt and rapidly become resistant to
chemotherapy. A study of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have
identified biological mechanisms driving this resistance to chemotherapy. Copy
number amplifications such as MCL1, MYC and JAK2, as well as PTEN deletions or
mutations have all been identified at a higher frequency in residual disease,
suggesting they may play a role in de novo or acquired chemotherapy resistance.
Increased copy number and expression of the PIM1 proto-oncogene in TNBC has also 
been identified as a new target of chemotherapy resistance. However, given the
genomic instability and subclonal nature of driver mutations in TNBC, single
agent targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective. Lately immune evasion has
also been identified as another key characteristic of poor prognostic and
chemo-resistant primary TNBCs. Combinations of checkpoint inhibition with
targeted therapy and/or chemotherapy are currently being investigated.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Jagged1/Notch3 signaling pathway plays a key role in
angiogenesis of breast cancer, but little is known in TNBC. This study was
designed to investigate the expression of Jagged1/Notch3 mRNA and protein in
TNBC, analyze their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and
prognosis. Moreover, the interrelationship among Jagged1/Notch3 and VEGF was
initially evaluated.
METHODS: Jagged1/Notch3 mRNA and protein expression levels were determined by
Q-RT-PCR and Western blotting. Additionally, Immunohistochemistry for
Jagged1/Notch3 was detected by Ventana platform, VEGF and CD34 was performed
using the EnVision/HRP technique.
RESULTS: mRNA transcriptionof Jagged1/Notch3 was in accord with protein
expression. TNBC patients with positive Jagged1 expression had poorer DFS
(p = 0.008) and OS (p = 0.004). Jagged1 expression was independent predictors of 
OS (p = 0.038). The expression of VEGF was positively correlative to MVD
(p = 0.018), MVD was significantly associated with Jagged1 (p <0.0001) and Notch3
(p <0.0001). The expression of Jagged1/Notch3 has no correlation with VEGF, only 
in positive VEGF expression of TNBC patients Jagged1/Notch3 had influence on DFS 
and OS (p <0.05).
CONCLUSION: Jagged1/Notch3 was -expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels,
Jagged1 served as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. We speculate that
there is a cross-talk between Jagged1/Notch3 and VEGF in TNBC angiogenesis.
Jagged1/Notch3 is expected to be an important signaling pathway for TNBC
progression and a potential target for TNBC neovascularization therapy.

BACKGROUND: The status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a prognostic
factor for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Recent studies have shown that
programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed 
on T lymphocytes or tumor cells modulating antitumor immunity. The regulation of 
immune checkpoints between tumor cells and T lymphocytes may serve as a target
for improvement of TNBC prognosis. We investigated TILs and PD-L1 status in TNBCs
before or after preoperative systemic therapy (PST) to elucidate the clinical
significance of PD-L1 expression.
METHODS: Ninety patients received PST, and materials of core needle biopsies
(CNB) taken before PST were available for 32 patients. TILs were scored as "%
stromal", and tumors were defined as High-TILs (≥30%) or Low-TILs (<30%). The
expression of PD-L1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: TILs status in CNB is significant in pathological therapeutic grade: 1
vs. 2 or 3 (p = 0.0359). Disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with Low-TIL
tumors were significantly worse than those with High-TIL tumors (p = 0.0383), but
overall survival (OS) showed no significance (p = 0.0772). However, in patients
with Low-TIL tumors, both DFS and OS in patients with High-PD-L1 expression were 
extremely unfavorable than in patients with Low-PD-L1 expression (p = 0.0032,
p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSION: The patients with TNBCs with combined Low-TILs and High-PD-L1 status 
in pre-PST situation showed unfavorable prognosis. The subset of TNBCs with
Low-TILs and High-PD-L1 status could be the therapeutic target for immune
checkpoint inhibitor.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subset of breast cancer that is highly 
aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Meanwhile, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are also
characterized by a strong tumorigenic potential, which might be partly
responsible for the aggressive behavior of TNBC. We previously showed that CSCs
are enriched in TNBC cell lines and tissues. Further experiments in animal models
revealed higher tumorigenicity of CSCs sorted from TNBC cell lines. In this
study, we aimed to determine the clinical relationship between CSCs and TNBC by
exploring the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), which is a putative
marker of breast CSCs, in TNBC tissues.ALDH1 levels in paraffin-embedded tumor
tissues from 158 TNBC patients were evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining
using an ALDH1A1 primary antibody. Staining evaluation was performed
independently by two pathologists, and the expression level of ALDH1 was
evaluated in terms of the percentage and intensity of positive cells. The
association of immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 expression with clinical
parameters was also analyzed.ALDH1 expression in tumor cells was observed in 88
out of 158 cases (55.7%). Analysis of clinicopathological parameters showed that 
the immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 was significantly correlated with
tumor size (P = 0.02) and stage (P = 0.04). Survival analysis in patients with
ALDH1 expression demonstrated shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall
survival (OS) times (P = 0.01; P = 0.001). Moreover, Cox multivariate analysis
revealed that ALDH1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of RFS and
OS (P = 0.04; P = 0.04).Immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 in tumor cells is 
an independent prognostic indicator of RFS and OS in TNBC patients.

Despite recent advances in molecularly directed therapy, triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) remains one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, still
without a suitable target for specific inhibitors. Maternal embryonic leucine
zipper kinase (MELK) is highly expressed in TNBC, where level of overexpression
correlates with poor prognosis and an aggressive disease course. Herein, we
describe the discovery through targeted kinase inhibitor library screening, and
structure-guided design of a series of ATP-competitive indolinone derivatives
with subnanomolar inhibition constants towards MELK. The most potent compound,
17, inhibits the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and proliferation
of TNBC cells exhibiting selectivity for cells expressing high levels of MELK.
These studies suggest that further elaboration of 17 will furnish MELK-selective 
inhibitors with potential for development in preclinical models of TNBC and other
cancers.

Purpose: Because of inherent disease heterogeneity, targeted therapies have
eluded triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and biomarkers predictive of
treatment response have not yet been identified. This study was designed to
determine whether the mTOR inhibitor everolimus with cisplatin and paclitaxel
would provide synergistic antitumor effects in TNBC.Methods: Patients with stage 
II/III TNBC were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of preoperative weekly
cisplatin, paclitaxel and daily everolimus or placebo for 12 weeks, until
definitive surgery. Tumor specimens were obtained at baseline, cycle 1, and
surgery. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR); secondary
endpoints included clinical responses, breast conservation rate, safety, and
discovery of molecular features associated with outcome.Results: Between 2009 and
2013, 145 patients were accrued; 36% of patients in the everolimus arm and 49% of
patients in the placebo arm achieved pCR; in each arm, 50% of patients achieved
complete responses by imaging. Higher rates of neutropenia, mucositis, and
transaminase elevation were seen with everolimus. Clinical response to therapy
and long-term outcome correlated with increased frequency of DNA damage response 
(DDR) gene mutations, Basal-like1 and Mesenchymal TNBC-subtypes, AR-negative
status, and high Ki67, but not with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.Conclusions:
The paclitaxel/cisplatin combination was well tolerated and active, but addition 
of everolimus was associated with more adverse events without improvement in pCR 
or clinical response. However, discoveries made from correlative studies could
lead to predictive TNBC biomarkers that may impact clinical decision-making and
provide new avenues for mechanistic exploration that could lead to clinical
utility. Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4035-45. ©2017 AACR.

Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are characterized 
by an unfavorable prognosis particularly when not responding well to
anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy. This is due to a more aggressive biology in
some cases but most importantly to a lack of agents other than conventional
chemotherapy. Hence, there is an urgent need to optimize therapy of patients with
TNBC in order to improve prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to present the current understanding
of TNBC biology and give an insight of current therapeutic concepts in the
neoadjuvant treatment setting.
METHOD: Current literature has been selected based on a literature search and
current therapeutic concepts are explained and commented on.
RESULTS: Novel therapeutic concepts for patients with TNBC focus on a)
chemotherapy optimization through alternate scheduling, dosing or
alternative/additional chemotherapeutic agents, b) evaluation of novel targeted
agents and c) identification of clinically relevant patient subgroups through
prognostic/ predictive biomarkers to enable a more personalized treatment
approach. Potential novel therapeutic targets include inhibition of
Poly-A-Ribose-Polymerase (PARP), checkpoint inhibition and antiandrogenic agents.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of TNBC is currently been optimized both through
optimization of chemotherapy and introduction of novel targeted agents which
should enhance treatment response rates in the future.

PURPOSE: Black women are more likely to develop early-onset (≤50 years) breast
cancer (BC) and have the lowest five-year, cause-specific survival rate of any
United States (U.S.) racial or ethnic group. These disparities can be attributed 
partially to the higher rate of triple-negative BC (TNBC) in Blacks. Yet, little 
is known about health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Black women with
TNBC.
METHODS: Black women with invasive BC ≤ 50 years were recruited via the Florida
Cancer Data System as part of a population-based case-only study of etiology and 
outcomes of early-onset invasive BC. Of 460 consented participants, a subset of
355 self-reported sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables.
Descriptive analyses included participants with known TNBC (n = 85) or non-TNBC
(n = 245) disease. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to
examine differences in factors associated with HRQOL.
RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, TNBC participants had significantly lower FACT-B
total scores (90.1 ± 27.9) compared to non-TNBC (98.5 ± 27.6) participants
(p < 0.05). For the TNBC group, multivariable analyses indicated five
individual-level, and three systemic-level factors explain 80% of the response
variation in HRQOL. For the non-TNBC group, seven individual-level factors and
three systemic-level factors account for 76% of the variation in HRQOL scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to Black women with non-TNBC, TNBC women have worse HRQOL. 
There are key individual and systemic-level factors that are unique to both
groups. Findings can inform future HRQOL interventions to support young Black BC 
survivors.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), owing to its aggressive behavior and
toxicity associated with available chemotherapy; currently no suitable therapy is
available. Honokiol (HNK) is a promising anticancer drug but has poor
bioavailability. In the current study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of an 
oral Honokiol nanomicellar (NM) formulation (size range of 20-40nm) in vitro
against various TNBC cells lines. Cytotoxicity, clonogenic and wound healing
assays demonstrated the promising anticancer effects. In vitro Caco-2
permeability studies suggested increased absorption of Honokiol. Compared to
HNK-FD, nanomicellar formulations resulted in significant increase in the oral
bioavailability. Cmax (4.06 and 3.60-fold) and AUC (6.26 and 5.83-fold) were
significantly increased in comparison to oral 40 and 80mg/kg free drug
respectively. Further, anticancer effects of these formulations were studied in
BALB/c nude mice transplanted with orthotopic MDA-MB-231 cell induced xenografts.
After 4 weeks of daily administration of HNK-NM formulation, significant
reduction in the tumor volumes and weights compared to free drug (p<0.001)
treated groups was observed. Surprisingly, in some of the animals (25%), the
treatment resulted in complete eradication of tumors. Increased apoptosis and
antiangiogenic effect was observed in HNK-NM groups compared to free drug and
untreated control animals. This is the first report demonstrating that HNK-FD
possesses anticancer effects against TNBC.

Triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC, lacks expression of estrogen receptor (ER), 
progesterone receptor (PR), and amplification of HER2/Neu] remains one of the
most aggressive subtypes, affects the youngest patients, and still lacks an
effective targeted therapy. Both phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-α and -β
contribute to oncogenesis of solid tumors, including the development of breast
cancer. Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) catalyzes the
removal of the 4'-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4)-bisphosphate
(PI-3,4-P2), creating phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. There is debate
concerning whether PI-3,4-P2 contributes to Akt and downstream effector
activation with the known canonical signaling second messenger,
phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). If PI-3,4-P2 is a positive
effector, INPP4B would be a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, and there is
some evidence to support this. Utilizing phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
on chromosome ten (PTEN)-null triple-negative breast tumor cell lines, it was
unexpectedly found that silencing INPP4B decreased basal phospho-Akt (pAkt) and
cellular proliferation, and in most cases sensitized cells to PI3K-α and PI3K-β
isoform-specific inhibitors. Conversely, overexpression of INPP4B desensitized
cells to PI3K inhibitors in a phosphatase activity-dependent manner. In summary, 
the current investigation of INPP4B in PTEN-null TNBC suggests new mechanistic
insight and the potential for targeted therapy for this aggressive subset of
breast cancer.Implications: These data support a model where PI-3,4-P2 is
inhibitory toward PI3K, revealing a novel feedback mechanism under conditions of 
excessive signaling, and potentially an indication for PI3K-β isoform-specific
inhibitors in PTEN-null TNBC that have lost INPP4B expression. Mol Cancer Res;

The mechanisms modulating the cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells were not fully understood. In this study, we 
performed data mining in Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner v4.0 and found that 
TNBC tumors had significantly higher NES mRNA expression than other breast cancer
subtypes. Pooled data suggested that NES mRNA expression is associated worse
metastatic relapse (MR) free survival and also worse any event (AE) free survival
in TNBC patients. Following data mining in multiple big data databases confirmed 
a positive correlation between SOX10 mRNA expression and NES mRNA expression in
breast cancer tissues. In addition, the expression of SOX10 mRNA is significantly
higher in TNBC tissues than in other breast cancer subtypes. SOX10 overexpression
resulted in Nestin upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels. Bioinformatic
analysis predicted a SOX10 binding site in NES promoter and the following dual
luciferase assay verified the binding site. Functionally, SOX10 overexpression
substantially increased CSC properties of TNBC cells, while SOX10 knockdown
decreased the CSC properties, in terms of CD24-/CD44+ cell ratio and
tumorsphere-forming capabilities. Enforced Nestin expression partly counteracted 
the effect of SOX10 knockdown on reducing the CSC properties. Based on these
findings, we infer that SOX10 regulates cancer stem cell properties of TNBC cells
via inducing Nestin expression.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) carries a worse
prognosis compared to the other subtypes. There have been conflicting studies
that race may impact the prognosis of TNBC patients. We aim to determine the
incidence and prognosis of TNBC among the different ethnic races in Singapore,
and to determine its associated risk factors for prognosis.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (BC) from 2005 to 2013 at
our tertiary institution were included and divided according to race and
subtypes. Demographic and clinical information of non-metastatic TNBC patients
were analyzed. Log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard
regression models were used to find associated risk factors related with overall 
survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: Among 1227 BC patients, 129 (10.5%) had TNBC. TNBC patients had the
worst OS (P: 0.0005) and DFS (P: 0.0016) among the subtypes. However, variations 
in race did not have any difference in OS or DFS among TNBC patients. Axillary
lymph node involvement, invasive lobular histology, larger tumor size, and the
presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were factors associated with both poor 
DFS and OS among TNBC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial variation did not have any impact on the prognosis of the
TNBC.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) progresses rapidly but lacks effective
targeted therapies. Our previous study showed that downregulating
syndecan-binding protein (SDCBP) in TNBC inhibits the proliferation of TNBC
cells. Dasatinib is a new small-molecule inhibitor of c-src phosphorylation. The 
aim of this study was to investigate if SDCBP is a potential marker to indicate
whether a TNBC is suitable for dasatinib therapy. This study applied
co-immunoprecipitation to identify the interaction between SDCBP and c-src in
TNBC cell lines. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to investigate SDCBP 
and tyrosine-419 phosphorylated c-src (p-c-src-Y419) expression in TNBC tissues. 
SDCBP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were then constructed to evaluate the
effects of dasatinib on SDCBP-induced TNBC progression in vitro and tumor
formation in nude mice. We found wild-type SDCBP interacted with c-src and
promoted the phosphorylation of c-src; this phosphorylation was completely
blocked by dasatinib. SDCBP lacking the PDZ domain had no such effect. Among the 
52 consecutive random TNBC cases examined, the expression of SDCBP was consistent
with that of p-c-src-Y419, and positively correlated with histological grading or
Ki-67 levels. SDCBP overexpression significantly accelerated the proliferation
and cell cycle progression of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231; these effects were
prevented by dasatinib treatment. However, the subsequent inhibition of p27
expression partially restored the proliferation and viability of the TNBC cells. 
The results of this study suggest that SDCBP interacts with c-src, regulates G1/S
in TNBC cells, and enhances tumor cell proliferation by promoting the tyrosine
phosphorylation of c-src at residue 419. Dasatinib inhibits such phosphorylation 
and blocks SDCBP-induced cell cycle progression. Therefore, SDCBP might be an
important marker for identifying TNBC cases that are suitable for dasatinib
therapy.

Cancer tissue functions as an ecosystem of a diverse set of cells that interact
in a complex tumor microenvironment. Genomic tools applied to biopsies in bulk
fail to account for this tumor heterogeneity, whereas single-cell imaging methods
limit the number of cells which can be assessed or are very resource intensive.
The current study presents methods based on flow cytometric analysis and cell
sorting using known cell surface markers (CXCR4/CD184, CD24, THY1/CD90) to
identify and interrogate distinct groups of cells in triple-negative breast
cancer clinical biopsy specimens from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The
results demonstrate that flow cytometric analysis allows a relevant subgrouping
of cancer tissue and that sorting of these subgroups provides insights into
cancer cell populations with unique, reproducible, and functionally divergent
gene expression profiles. The discovery of a drug resistance signature implies
that uncovering the functional interaction between these populations will lead to
deeper understanding of cancer progression and drug response.Implications:
PDX-derived human breast cancer tissue was investigated at the single-cell level,
and cell subpopulations defined by surface markers were identified which suggest 
specific roles for distinct cellular compartments within a solid tumor. Mol

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous form of malignant
disease. Due to lack of proper therapeutic target treatment options are
restricted and relies primarily on chemotherapeutic modality for treatment of
patients. Despite significant early regression of the disease in response to
chemotherapy, complete cure is not assured with development of resistant tumors
which is difficult to manage clinically. In the last decades, the regulation and 
contribution of microRNAs in tumorigenesis including breast cancers have been
well-documented. Thus, here it is hypothesized that by identifying the microRNAs 
responsible for chemoresistance in TNBC and targeting the microRNAs along with
chemotherapeutic approaches might exert an improved response. To accomplish this,
an in vivo screening has to be performed by transfecting tumor cell line with
lentiviral pool of library expressing microRNAs. Following treatment of primary
tumors in mice and growth of relapsed tumors, microRNA profile has to be analyzed
by qRT-PCR and sequencing to detect the microRNAs contributing to the
chemoresistance which can be targeted by anti-microRNA strategies.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive, heterogeneous
disease with poor prognosis and no effective targeted therapies. EGFR is highly
expressed in basal-like TNBC and is considered as a potential therapeutic target.
However, EGFR targeting exerts only marginal clinical benefits, possibly due to
activation of compensatory signaling pathways, which are frequently associated
with HER3 upregulation. Here we show that concomitant targeting of EGFR and the
nonreceptor tyrosine kinases PYK2/FAK synergistically inhibits the proliferation 
of basal-like TNBC cells in vitro and attenuates tumor growth in a mouse
xenograft model. Dual targeting of EGFR and PYK2/FAK inhibited complementary key 
growth and survival pathways mediated by AKT, S6K, STAT3, and ERK1/2 activation. 
PYK2 inhibition also abrogated HER3 upregulation in response to EGFR antagonists,
thereby circumventing HER3-associated drug resistance. Mechanistically, PYK2
inhibition facilitated the proteasomal degradation of HER3 while inducing
upregulation of NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated 1 gene). NDRG1 enhanced the
interaction of HER3 with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, while PYK2, which interacts 
with NEDD4 and HER3, interfered with NEDD4-HER3 binding, suggesting that the
PYK2-NDRG1-NEDD4 circuit has a critical role in receptor degradation, drug
response, and resistance mechanism. Our studies offer a preclinical proof of
concept for a strategy of cotargeting the EGFR and PYK2/FAK kinases to improve
TNBC therapy. Cancer Res; 77(1); 86-99. ©2016 AACR.

Treatment protocols for breast cancer depend predominantly on receptor status
with respect to estrogen (estrogen receptor alpha), progesterone (progesterone
receptor) and human epidermal growth factor [human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)]. The presence of one or more of these receptors suggests that 
a treatment targeting these pathways might be effective, while the absence of, or
in the case of HER2, lack of overexpression of, all of these receptors, termed
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), indicates a need for the more toxic
chemotherapy. In an effort to develop targeted therapies for TNBC, it will be
necessary to differentiate among specific TNBC subtypes. The subset of TNBC that 
expresses androgen receptor (AR) has been determined to express genes consistent 
with a luminal subtype and therefore may be amenable to therapies targeting
either AR, itself, or other pathways typical of a luminal subtype. Recent
investigations of the AR signal pathway within breast cancer lead to AR as a
significant target for breast cancer therapy with several clinical trials
currently in progress. The subclass of TNBC that lacks AR, which we have termed
quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC) currently lacks a defined targetable
pathway. Unlike AR-positive TNBC, QNBC predominantly exhibits a basal-like
molecular subtype. Several subtypes and related pathway proteins are
preferentially expressed in QNBC that may serve as effective targets for
treatment, such as ACSL4, SKP2 and EGFR. ACSL4 expression has been demonstrated
to be inversely correlated with expression of hormone/growth factor receptors and
may thus serve as a biomarker for QNBC as well as a target for therapy. In the
following review we summarize some of the current efforts to develop alternatives
to chemotherapy for TNBC and QNBC.

Bursts of Chromosome Changes Drive TNBC.

[No authors listed]

A recent study suggests that complex genomic rearrangements in triple-negative
breast cancer cells occur through a "Big Bang" model-early, short bursts of copy 
number aberrations, rather than progressive accumulation over time. Afterward,
these aberrations are stably maintained in a handful of clones that expand to
form the tumor mass.

Previous studies have indicated that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer
antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) levels are both independent prognostic factors in breast
cancer. However, the utility of CEA and CA15-3 levels as conventional cancer
biomarkers in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains
controversial. The current study was performed to explore the predictive value of
pre-therapeutic serum CEA and CA15-3 levels, and nomograms were developed
including these serum cancer biomarkers to improve the prognostic evaluation of
TNBC patients. Pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA concentrations were measured in 247
patients with stage I-IV TNBC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that TNBC patients
with high levels of both CEA and CA15-3 had shorter overall survival (OS) and
disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those in the low-level groups (p<0.05).
Multivariate analysis suggested that pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA levels are
independent predictive elements for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.040, respectively)
and DFS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.028, respectively). In addition, novel nomograms
were established and validated to provide personal forecasts of OS and DFS for
patients with TNBC. These novel nomograms may help physicians to select the
optimal treatment plans to ensure the best outcomes for TNBC patients.

We investigated gene expression profiles of the NF-κB pathway in patients with
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) receiving adjuvant chemotherapy to determine
the prognostic value of NF-κB pathway genes according to chemotherapeutic
regimen. We used the nCounter expression assay to measure expression of 11 genes 
(NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, RELB, REL, TP53, FOXC1, TBP, SP1, STAT3 and IRF1 genes)
belonging to the NF-κB pathway using mRNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor 
tissues from 203 patients diagnosed with TNBC. Of the 203 patients, 116 were
treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen containing doxorubicin. As revealed by
the expression profiles of the 11 genes, increased expression of SP1 was
associated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin
chemotherapy (5-year distant recurrence-free survival [5Y DRFS], low vs. high
expression [cut-off: median]: 92.3% vs. 71.6%, P = 0.001). In a multivariate Cox 
regression model, SP1 expression was a useful marker for predicting long-term
prognosis in TNBC patients receiving doxorubicin treatment, and we thus suggest
that SP1 expression could serve as a prognostic marker in these patients.

Estrogen receptor-, progesterone receptor- and HER2-negative breast cancers, also
known as triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), have poor prognoses and are
refractory to current therapeutic agents, including epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents is often
associated with sustained kinase phosphorylation, which promotes EGFR activation 
and translocation to the nucleus and prevents these agents from acting on their
targets. The mechanisms underlying this resistance have not been fully
elucidated. In addition, the IL-17E receptor is overexpressed in TNBC tumors and 
is associated with a poor prognosis. We have previously reported that IL-17E
promotes TNBC resistance to anti-mitotic therapies. Here, we investigated whether
IL-17E promotes TNBC resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents by exploring the 
link between the IL-17E/IL-17E receptor axis and EGF signaling. We found that
IL-17E, similarly to EGF, activates the EGFR in TNBC cells that are resistant to 
EGFR inhibitors. It also activates the PYK-2, Src and STAT3 kinases, which are
essential for EGFR activation and nuclear translocation. IL-17E binds its
specific receptor, IL-17RA/IL17RB, on these TNBC cells and synergizes with the
EGF signaling pathway, thereby inducing Src-dependent EGFR transactivation and
pSTAT3 and pEGFR translocation to the nucleus. Collectively, our data indicate
that the IL-17E/IL-17E receptor axis may underlie TNBC resistance to EGFR
inhibitors and suggest that inhibiting IL-17E or its receptor in combination with
EGFR inhibitor administration may improve TNBC management.

PURPOSE: The optimum local surgical strategy regarding breast-conserving therapy 
(BCT) for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is controversial. To investigate
whether BCT is appropriate for patients with TNBC, we evaluated the clinical
outcomes of BCT in women with TNBC compared to those of women without TNBC, using
a large, single-center cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1533 women (TNBC 
n=321; non-TNBC n=1212) who underwent BCT for primary breast cancer between 2000 
and 2010. Clinicopathological characteristics, locoregional recurrence-free
survival (LRFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Tumors from the TNBC group had a higher T stage (T2 37.4% vs. 21.0%,
p<0.001), a lower N stage (N0 86.9% vs. 75.5%, p<0.001), and a higher histologic 
grade (Grade III 66.8% vs. 15.4%, p<0.001) than the non-TNBC group. There were no
differences in 5-year LRFS rates between the TNBC and non-TNBC groups (98.7% vs. 
97.8%, p=0.63). The non-TNBC group showed a slightly better 5-year OS than the
TNBC group; however, the difference was not significant (96.2% vs. 97.3%,
p=0.72). In multivariate analyses, TNBC was not associated with poor clinical
outcomes in terms of LRFS and OS [hazard ratio (HR) for LRFS=0.37, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.10-1.31; HR for OS=1.03, 95% CI: 0.31-3.39].
CONCLUSION: TNBC patients who underwent BCT showed non-inferior locoregional
recurrence compared to non-TNBC patients with BCT. Thus, BCT is an acceptable
surgical approach in patients with TNBC.

PURPOSE: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a distinct subtype of breast
cancer with unique pathologic, molecular and clinical behavior. It occurs more
frequently in young blacks and has been reported to have a shorter disease-free
interval. We undertook this study to analyze the demographic characteristics,
failure patterns, and survival outcomes in this disease.
METHODS: A total of 448 non-Hispanic black and white women were identified over a
15 year period from 1996 to 2011. Demographic and clinical information including 
age, race, menopausal status, stage, tumor characteristics, and treatments were
collected. Fisher's exact test and multivariable Cox regression were used to
compare failure patterns and survival outcomes between races.
RESULTS: 49 % (n = 223) were black. 59 % patients were between 41 and 60 years,
with 18 % ≤40 years. 57 % were premenopausal and 89 % had grade 3 tumors. Stage
II (47 %) was most frequent stage at diagnosis followed by stage III (28 %). 32 %
had lymphovascular invasion. Adjusting for age, stage, and grade, there was no
difference in survival outcomes (OS, DFS, LFFS, and DFFS) between the two races. 
62 (14 %) patients failed locally either in ipsilateral breast or chest wall, and
19 (4 %) failed in the regional lymphatics. Lung (18 %) was the most frequent
distant failure site with <12 % each failing in brain, liver and bones.
CONCLUSION: Failure patterns and survival outcomes did not differ by race in this
large collection of TNBC cases. Lung was the predominate site of distant failure 
followed by brain, bone, and liver. Few patients failed in the regional
lymphatics.

In order to examine whether the length of the bridging chain in ansa-ferrocenes
affects their antiproliferative activity against MDA-MB-231 triple negative
breast cancer cell lines (TNBC), we synthesized derivatives of the type
1-[bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)]methylidene-[n]ferrocenophane and
1-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)-phenyl]methylidene-[n]ferrocenophane with n = 3, 4, 5. We
found that the derivatives of [3]ferrocenophane, the compounds with the shortest 
bridging chains, are the most active. IC50 values were 0.09 ± 0.01, 2.41 ± 0.10, 
and 1.85 ± 0.25 μM for the dihydroxyphenyl derivatives, with n = 3, 4, 5,
respectively. These differences can be explained in terms of modification of the 
key metabolites (radical versus quinone methides) within the ansa series
depending on the length of the bridging chain. The derivative of
[5]ferrocenophane, possessing two -[bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)]methylidene groups, was
also prepared. Surprisingly, this relatively large molecule is also active (IC50 
= 2.7 ± 0.3 μM). Two ruthenocenophane analogs were also synthesized. These
ruthenium compounds are practically inactive against MDA-MB-231 cells. The
unusual chemistry of these different compounds is discussed in terms of
elucidating the mechanism underlying their diverse antiproliferative activity,
and their specific advantages are evaluated.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of
breast cancer with poor 5-year survival. Knowledge and information about IBC with
the triple negative (TNBC) phenotype are limited. Here, we report the
characteristics and outcome of inflammatory TNBC (I-TNBC) cancer cohorts from a
large TNBC dataset.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: After obtaining institutional review board approval, we
collected information on 476 women with a diagnosis of TNBC from 1996 to 2011.
Data on patient characteristics, tumor, and treatment were collected. Overall
survival (OS) was computed from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or
last follow-up. For disease-free survival (DFS), patients were scored if they
failed. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.3.
RESULTS: A total of 34 (7%) patients were diagnosed with inflammatory TNBC. The
median age was 52 years, and 56% were white. The median follow-up was 13 months
(interquartile range, 2-126 months). Twenty-one percent (n = 7) presented with
stage IV disease, while 91% had axillary nodal involvement. All but 2 (94%; n =
32) patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with 6% (n = 2) achieving complete
response. Twenty-one (62%) patients underwent mastectomy; 71% (n = 24) received
radiation. The 2- and 5-year OS and DFS were 34%, 26% (vs. 65%, 46%) and 27%, 23%
(vs. 53%, 40%), respectively, for I-TNBC and non-inflammatory stage III-IV TNBC. 
Compared with the non-inflammatory group, the 2- and 5-year OS (P < .0005) and
DFS (P < .0073) were significantly inferior for I-TNBC.
CONCLUSION: IBC with the triple negative phenotype is an aggressive disease with 
a significantly inferior outcome compared with non-inflammatory locally advanced 
TNBC. Newer strategies are required to improve survival outcome.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with
aggressive tumor behavior and worse outcomes. In a study at a tertiary care
breast unit in a developing country, clinico-pathological attributes and outcomes
of patients with TNBC were compared with (c.w.) ER, PR, and/or HER2 expressing
tumors (non-TNBC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 1213 consecutive breast cancer patients 
managed during 2004-2010 were reviewed. An evaluable cohort of 705 patients with 
complete treatment and follow-up (median 36 months) information was thus
identified. Patients were categorized per ER, PR & HER2 status into TNBC, and
ER/PR+ and/or HER2+ groups. Clinico-pathological parameters, response to NACT,
and OS & DFS were compared between TNBC and non-TNBC groups.
RESULTS: TNBC patients (n = 249) comprised 35.3 % of the study cohort (n = 705), 
and were significantly younger than non-TNBC patients (mean age 49.1 ± 11.2y c.w.
51.8 ± 11.3, p = 0.02). The TNM stage at presentation was similar in the two
groups (Stage I and II-37 % c.w. 44.3 %, Stage III-47.5 % c.w. 39.5 %, Stage
IV-15.5 % c.w. 16.2 % in TNBC c.w. Non-TNBC; p = 0.09). Tumor size (5.7 ± 2.9 cm 
TNBC c.w. 5.4 ± 2.8 cm non-TNBC, p = 0.22) was similar but lymph nodal (cN)
metastases were more frequent in TNBC (77.3 % c.w. 69.8 %; p = 0.03). TNBC had
higher histologic grade (97.1 % gr II/III in TNBC c.w. 91.2 % non-TNBC, p = 0.01)
and higher incidence of LVI (20.4 % in TNBC c.w. 13.5 %, p = 0.03). Patient
groups received similar multi-disciplinary surgical, radiation, and systemic
treatment. Comparable proportion of patients in 2 groups were treated with NACT
(42 % c.w. 38 %), which resulted in pathological complete response (pCR) in
27.5 % TNBC patients c.w. 17.1 % non-TNBC patients (p = 0.04). Both OS
(81.8 ± 4.52 c.w. 97.90 ± 3.87 months, p < 0.001) and DFS (89.2 ± 5.1 c.w.
113.8 ± 4.3 months, p < 0.001) were shorter in TNBC than non-TNBC group. On
stage-wise comparison, OS differed significantly only in stage III
(47.4 ± 5.3 months in TNBC c.w. 74.5 ± 4.4 in non-TNBC; p < 0.001). Univariate
and multivariate analyses revealed tumor stage and IHC subtyping into TNBC c.w.
non-TNBC as most important factors predictive of survival.
CONCLUSIONS: TNBC occurred at younger age and exhibited aggressive pathology as
compared to non-TNBC patients. Although patients with TNBC exhibited better
chemo-sensitivity, they had worse DFS and OS compared to the non-TNBC patients.
The survival of Stage III TNBC patients was significantly worse compared to
non-TNBC group; while in stages I, II, and IV, survival were not significantly
different.

BACKGROUND: Treatment options for women presenting with triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) are limited due to the lack of a therapeutic target and as a
result, are managed with standard chemotherapy such as paclitaxel (Taxol®).
Following chemotherapy, the ideal tumour response is apoptotic cell death.
Post-chemotherapy, cells can maintain viability by undergoing viable cellular
responses such as cellular senescence, generating secretomes which can directly
enhance the malignant phenotype.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: How tumour cells retain viability in response to
chemotherapeutic engagement is discussed. In addition we discuss the implications
of this retained tumour cell viability in the context of the development of
recurrent and metastatic TNBC disease. Current adjuvant and neo-adjuvant
treatments available and the novel potential therapies that are being researched 
are also reviewed.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Cellular senescence and cytoprotective autophagy are potential
mechanisms of chemoresistance in TNBC. These two non-apoptotic outcomes in
response to chemotherapy are inextricably linked and are neglected outcomes of
investigation in the chemotherapeutic arena. Cellular fate assessments may
therefore have the potential to predict TNBC patient outcome.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Focusing on the fact that cancer cells can bypass the
desired cellular apoptotic response to chemotherapy through cellular senescence
and cytoprotective autophagy will highlight the importance of targeting
non-apoptotic survival pathways to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy.

PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer
subtype that is associated with poor clinical outcome. There is a vital need for 
effective targeted therapeutics for TNBC patients, yet treatment strategies are
challenged by the significant intertumoral heterogeneity within the TNBC subtype 
and its surrounding microenvironment. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are highly 
expressed in several TNBC subtypes and are promising therapeutic targets. In this
study, we targeted the MET receptor, which is highly expressed across several
TNBC subtypes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using the small-molecule inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184), we 
examined the efficacy of MET inhibition in preclinical models that recapitulate
human TNBC and its microenvironment. To analyze the dynamic interactions between 
TNBC cells and fibroblasts over time, we utilized a 3D model referred to as MAME 
(Mammary Architecture and Microenvironment Engineering) with quantitative image
analysis. To investigate cabozantinib inhibition in vivo, we used a novel
xenograft model that expresses human HGF and supports paracrine MET signaling.
RESULTS: XL184 treatment of MAME cultures of MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells (±
HGF-expressing fibroblasts) was cytotoxic and significantly reduced multicellular
invasive outgrowths, even in cultures with HGF-expressing fibroblasts. Treatment 
with XL184 had no significant effects on MET(neg) breast cancer cell growth. In
vivo assays demonstrated that cabozantinib treatment significantly inhibited TNBC
growth and metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Using preclinical TNBC models that recapitulate the breast tumor
microenvironment, we demonstrate that cabozantinib inhibition is an effective
therapeutic strategy in several TNBC subtypes.

Upon analysis of archived primary tumors of 482 patients with triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) enrolled in two randomized Phase III adjuvant chemotherapy
trials, we have found that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), as assessed and
quantified by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining are a robust and independent
predictor of disease-free survival (DFS), distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI)
and overall survival (OS).1 Our findings provide confirmation of results observed
in TNBC in a European adjuvant chemotherapy dataset and therefore elevate TILs as
prognostic biomarker for operable TNBC to level I evidence.

Despite the promise of targeted therapies, there remains an urgent need for
effective treatment for esophageal cancer (EC) and triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC). Current FDA-approved drugs have significant problems of toxicity, safety,
selectivity, efficacy and development of resistance. In this manuscript, we
demonstrate that rationally designed peptide vaccines/mimics are a viable
therapeutic strategy for blocking aberrant molecular signaling pathways with high
affinity, specificity, potency and safety. Specifically, we postulate that novel 
combination treatments targeting members of the EGFR family and IGF-1R will yield
significant anti-tumor effects in in vitro models of EC and TNBC possibly
overcoming mechanisms of resistance. We show that the combination of HER-1 and
HER-2 or HER-1 and IGF-1R peptide mimics/vaccine antibodies exhibited enhanced
antitumor properties with significant inhibition of tumorigenesis in OE19 EC and 
MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines. Our work elucidates the mechanisms of HER-1/IGF-1R
and HER-1/HER-2 signaling in these cancer cell lines, and the promising results
support the rationale for dual targeting with HER-1 and HER-2 or IGF-1R as an
improved treatment regimen for advanced therapy tailored to difference types of
cancer.

To date, there is no available targeted therapy for patients who are diagnosed
with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The aim of this study was to identify
a new specific target for specific treatments. Frozen primary tumors were
collected from 83 adjuvant therapy-naive TNBC patients. These samples were used
for global proteome profiling by iTRAQ-OFFGEL-LC-MS/MS approach in two series: a 
training cohort (n = 42) and a test set (n = 41). Patients who remains free of
local or distant metastasis for a minimum of 5 years after surgery were
classified in the no-relapse group; the others were in the relapse group. OPLS
and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to select candidate markers, which were 
validated by immunohistochemistry. Three proteins were identified in the training
set and validated in the test set by Kaplan-Meier method and immunohistochemistry
(IHC): TrpRS as a good prognostic markers and DP and TSP1 as bad prognostic
markers. We propose the establishment of an IHC test to calculate the score of
TrpRS, DP, and TSP1 in TNBC tumors to evaluate the degree of aggressiveness of
the tumors. Finally, we propose that DP and TSP1 could provide therapeutic
targets for specific treatments.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease without
established targeted treatment options for patients with metastatic disease. This
study was undertaken to evaluate potentially actionable biomarkers in a large
cohort of TNBC and compare them with non-TNBCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 6341 (2111 TNBC and 4230 non-TNBC) breast
cancer samples at a central laboratory for biomarkers of potential drug response 
across multiple platforms, including gene sequencing, protein expression, and
gene copy number.
RESULTS: TNBC expresses androgen receptor (AR) in a significantly (P < .05) lower
percentage of cases (17%) than hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast carcinomas (59% and 79%,
respectively), and gene comutations were differentially associated with
AR-positive versus AR-negative cases. Higher AR expression levels in TNBC
predicted for lower Ki-67 levels. Seventy percent of TNBC harbored a
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA),
v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), or phosophatase and tensin 
homolog (PTEN) aberration. TNBC patients had a significantly lower PIK3CA
mutation rate (13%) than all other subtypes (P < .05) and a higher tumor protein 
p53 (TP53) mutation rate (64%) than the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cases
(approximately 30%; P < .05). Topoisomerase 2 (TOP2A) amplification was observed 
in 1.3% of TNBC and in 1.6% of HER2-negative, HR-positive cancers; in contrast,
HER2-positive, HR-negative or HR-positive cancers exhibited TOP2A amplification
in 19% and 40% of cases, respectively (P <.05).
CONCLUSION: Multi-platform molecular profiling identifies subgroups of TNBC with 
different biomarker profiles, suggesting numerous potentially targetable
alterations in TNBC. TNBC is further characterized by different gene mutations
and proliferative activity relative to AR expression, highlighting a need for
comprehensive pathologic examination with potential to develop different,
individualized treatment options.

BACKGROUND: TNBC is an aggressive subset of breast cancer (BC) without specific
target therapy.
METHODS: This observational, retrospective study included 45 cases of TNBC. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of the AR, E-cadherin and Ki-67 
in relation to histological type, time to relapse and overall survival (OS).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tumor samples obtained from patients defined TNBC.
RESULTS: The AR was positive (IHC >10%) in 26.6%. E-cadherin (CDH1) expression
was considered positive if the score was ≥ 2. This expression was negative in
53.3% cases. The Ki-67 index was ≥ 20% in 37.7%. Univariate analyses showed that 
AR, CDH1 and Ki-67 are significantly associated with OS. Multivariate analysis
showed that AR and Ki-67 expression are independent variables associated with OS.
The statistical analysis showed that patients with AR negative and Ki-67 positive
expression have a significant correlation with poor outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the combination of AR and E-cadherin
expression as well as Ki-67 status might be useful prognostic markers in TNBC.
Hence, these molecular determinants could play an interesting role to classify
subgroups of TNBC.

BACKGROUND: MiR-27a is significantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC). However, the exact biological function of MiR-27a in TNBC is not
fully understood. In this study, we verified miR-27a expression in TNBC cells and
explored how its overexpression modulates radiosensitivity of the cells.
MATERIAL/METHODS: qRT-PCR analysis was performed to study miR-27a expression in
TNBC lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and in normal human breast epithelial cell
line MCF10A. Dual luciferase assay was performed to verify a putative downstream 
target of miR-27a, CDC27. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the influence of
miR-27a-CDC27 axis on cell proliferation under irradiation (IR) treatment.
RESULTS: We confirmed significantly higher miR-27a expression in 2 TNBC cell
lines--MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231--than in human breast epithelial cell line
MCF10A. miR-27a could modulate proliferation and radiosensitivity of TNBC cells. 
CDC-27 is a direct target of miR-27a and its downregulation conferred increased
radioresistance of the cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The miR-27a-CDC27 axis might play an important role in modulating
response to radiotherapy in TNBC cells. Testing miR-27a expression might be a
useful way to identify a subgroup of patients who will benefit from an IR-based
therapeutic approach.

BACKGROUND: Migration and invasion are two crucial steps of tumor metastasis.
Blockage of these steps may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk. The
objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of diallyl
trisulfide (DATS), a natural organosulfuric compound with most sulfur atoms found
in garlic, on migration and invasion in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DATS were
further investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 cells and HS 578t breast cancer cells were
treated with different concentrations of DATS. DATS obviously suppressed the
migration and invasion of two cell lines and changed the morphological. Moreover,
DATS inhibited the mRNA/protein/ enzymes activities of MMP2/9 via attenuating the
NF-κB pathway. DATS also inhibited ERK/MAPK rather than p38 and JNK.
CONCLUSION: DATS inhibits MMP2/9 activity and the metastasis of TNBC cells, and
emerges as a potential anti-cancer agent. The inhibitory effects are associated
with down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and ERK/MAPK
signaling pathways.

The pan-PI3K inhibitors are one treatment option for triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC). However, this treatment is ineffective for unknown reasons. Here, 
we report that aberrant expression of wingless-type MMTV integration site family 
(WNT) and activated WNT signals, which crosstalk with the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
pathway through GSK3β, plays the most critical role in resistance to pan-PI3K
inhibitors in TNBC cells. GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor that activates the
WNT/beta-catenin pathway in TNBC cells through stimulation of WNT secretion.
GDC-0941-triggered WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation was observed in MDA-MB-231
and HCC1937 cells, which are TNBC cell lines showing aberrant WNT/beta-catenin
activation, and not in SKBR3 and MCF7 cells. This observation is further
investigated in vivo. GDC-0941 exhibited minimal tumor inhibition in MDA-MB-231
cells, but it significantly suppressed tumor growth in HER-positive SK-BR3 cells.
In vivo mechanism study revealed the activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway by
GDC-0941. A synergistic effect was observed when combined treatment with GDC-0941
and the WNT inhibitor LGK974 at low concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells. These
findings indicated that WNT pathway activation conferred resistance in TNBC cells
treated with GDC-0941. This resistance may be further circumvented through
combined treatment with pan-PI3K and WNT inhibitors. Future clinical trials of
these two inhibitors are warranted.

Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA-15) is known to sequester
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytoplasm, inhibiting
tumorigenesis of human breast cancer cells. Here, we describe how PEA-15
expression affects the dephosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contacts in
MDA-MB-468, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The increased
intracellular calcium concentration resulting from increased cytoplasmic
phosphorylated ERK facilitates movement of ER-anchored calcium sensors to the PM.
The driving force of trans-localization of calcium-dependent proteins enhances
the contact between the activated EGFR and ER-localized phosphatase, PTP1B.
Consequently, our findings suggest a mechanism underneath the facilitation of
EGFR dephosphorylation by cytoplasmic PEA-15 expression inside TNBC cells, which 
may be one of the dynamic mechanisms for down-regulation of activated EGFR in
cancer cells.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are highly aggressive cancers that lack
targeted therapies. However, EGFR is frequently activated in a subset of TNBCs
and represents a viable clinical target. Because the endocytic adaptor protein
Endophilin A2 (SH3GL1/Endo II) has been implicated in EGFR internalization, we
investigated Endo II expression and function in human TNBCs. Endo II expression
was high in several TNBC cells compared with normal breast epithelial cells.
Stable knockdown (KD) of Endo II was achieved in two TNBC cell lines, and
although cell viability was unaffected, defects in receptor-mediated endocytosis 
were observed. EGFR signaling to Erk and Akt kinases was impaired in Endo II KD
cells, and this correlated with reduced rates of EGFR internalization and cell
motility. Endo II KD cells also displayed defects in three dimensional (3D) cell 
invasion, and this correlated with impaired extracellular matrix degradation and 
internalization of MT1-MMP. Endo II silencing also caused a significant reduction
in TNBC tumor growth and lung metastasis in mammary orthotopic tumor xenograft
assays. In human breast tumor specimens, Endo II expression was highest in TNBC
tumors compared with other subtypes, and at the level of gene expression, high
Endo II was associated with reduced relapse-free survival in patients with
basal-like breast cancers. Together, these results identify a positive role for
Endo II in TNBC tumor metastasis and a potential link with poor
prognosis.IMPLICATIONS: Endophilin A2 and related adaptor proteins represent
important signaling hubs to target in metastatic cancers.

Clinical studies suggest that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing tumors could benefit from
therapy with Cetuximab, which targets EGFR. NK cells are the primary effectors of
antibody (Ab)-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and thus play a role in
Ab-based therapies. We have previously described diminished levels of
Cetuximab-mediated ADCC in vitro in patients with advanced breast cancer. Here,
we investigated the potential causes of this NK-cell functional deficiency. We
characterized NK-cell activating/inhibitory receptors in the peripheral blood of 
breast cancer patients and found CD85j inhibitory receptor overexpression. The
capacity of NK cells to perform Cetuximab-triggered ADCC against TNBC cells
correlated inversely with CD85j expression, even in the presence of the
stimulatory cytokines IL-2 or IL-15. Hence, patients expressing high levels of
CD85j had an impaired ability to lyse TNBC cells in the presence of Cetuximab. We
also found that CD85j overexpression was associated with HLA-I and soluble HLA-G 
expression by tumors. A CD85j functional blockade with a CD85j antagonist Ab
restored ADCC levels in breast cancer patients and reverted this negative effect.
Our data suggest that strategies that overcome the hurdles of immune activation
could improve Cetuximab clinical efficacy.

Early-onset diagnosis is an eligibility criterion for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA)
testing in sporadic breast cancer patients. Limited family structure has been
proposed as a predictor of BRCA mutation status in this group of patients. An
overwhelming amount of data supports a strong association between BRCA1 mutations
and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we analyze the feasibility of
using limited family structure and TNBC as predictors of BRCA mutation status in 
early-onset breast cancer patients attending genetic counseling units. We have
conducted the study in a cohort of sporadic early-onset (≤35 years) breast cancer
patients (N = 341) previously selected for BRCA genetic testing in Academic
Hereditary Cancer Clinics from Spain. A retrospective review of medical records
available at the time of risk assessment allowed us classifying patients
according to family structure and TNBC. In addition, BRCAPRO score was calculated
for all patients. Association between categorical variables was investigated
using the Fisher's exact test. Binary Logistic Regression Analysis was used for
multivariate analysis. Limited family structure (OR 3.61, p = 0.013) and TNBC (OR
3.14, p = 0.013) were independent predictors of BRCA mutation status. Mutation
prevalence in the subgroup of patients with at least one positive predictor was
14%, whereas it dropped to 3% in non-TNBCs with adequate family history (OR 5.31,
95% CI 1.38-23.89, p = 0.006). BRCAPRO correctly discerned between limited and
adequate family structures. Limited family structure and TNBC are feasible
predictors of BRCA mutation status in sporadic early-onset (≤35 years) breast
cancer patients attending genetic counseling units. The low prevalence of
mutations observed in non-TNBCs with adequate family structure suggests that this
subgroup of patients might be excluded from genetic testing.

The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important
diagnostic marker for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which lack
three hormonal receptors: estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as
epidermal growth factor receptor 2. EGFR transactivation can cause drug
resistance in many cancers including TNBC, but the mechanism underlying this
phenomenon is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that insulin treatment induces
EGFR activation by stimulating the interaction of EGFR with insulin-like growth
factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) in the MDA-MB-436 TNBC cell line. These cells express 
low levels of EGFR, while exhibiting high levels of IGF-1R expression and
phosphorylation. Low-EGFRexpressing MDA-MB-436 cells show high sensitivity to
insulinstimulated cell growth. Therefore, unexpectedly, insulin stimulation
induced EGFR transactivation by regulating its interaction with IGF-1R in
low-EGFR-expressing TNBC cells.

Triple negative breast cancers express receptors for gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) in more than 50% of the cases, which can be targeted with peptidic
analogs of GnRH, such as triptorelin. The current study investigates cytotoxic
activity of triptorelin as a monotherapy and in treatment combinations with
chemotherapeutic agents and inhibitors of the PI3K and the ERK pathways in in
vitro models of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). GnRH receptor expression
of TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 was investigated. Cells were treated
with triptorelin, chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, docetaxel, AEZS-112),
PI3K/AKT inhibitors (perifosine, AEZS-129), an ERK inhibitor (AEZS-134), and dual
PI3K/ERK inhibitor AEZS-136 applied as single agent therapies and in
combinations. MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 TNBC cells both expressed receptors for GnRH
on messenger (m)RNA and protein level and were found sensitive to triptorelin
with a respective median effective concentration (EC50) of 31.21 ± 0.21 and
58.50 ± 19.50. Synergistic effects occurred when triptorelin was combined with
cisplatin. In HCC1806 cells, synergy occurred when triptorelin was applied with
PI3K/AKT inhibitors perifosine and AEZS-129. In MDA-MB-231 cells, synergy was
observed after co-treatment with triptorelin and ERK inhibitor AEZS-134 and dual 
PI3K/ERK inhibitor AEZS-136. GnRH receptors on TNBC cells can be used for
targeted therapy of these cancers with GnRH agonist triptorelin. Treatment
combinations based on triptorelin and PI3K and ERK inhibitors and
chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin have synergistic effects in in vitro models of
TNBC. If confirmed in vivo, clinical trials based on triptorelin and cisplatin
could be quickly carried out, as triptorelin is FDA approved for other
indications and known to be well tolerated.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one type of breast cancer (BC), which is 
defined as negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2). Its origins and development seem
to be elusive. And for now, drugs like tamoxifen or trastuzumab which
specifically apply to ER, PR or Her2 positive BC seem unforeseeable in TNBC
clinical treatment. Due to its extreme malignancy, high recurrence rate and poor 
prognosis, a lot of work on the research of TNBC is needed. This review aims to
summarize the latest findings in TNBC in risk factors, possible therapeutic
targets and possible prognostic makers.

The cytokine TWEAK and its receptor, Fn14, have emerged as potentially valuable
targets for cancer therapy. Granzyme B (GrB)-containing Fn14-targeted constructs 
were generated containing either the Fn14 ligand TWEAK (GrB-TWEAK) or an
anti-Fn14 humanized single-chain antibody (GrB-Fc-IT4) as the targeting moieties.
Both constructs showed high affinity and selective cytotoxicity against a panel
of Fn14-expressing human tumor cells including triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) lines. Cellular expression of the GrB inhibitor PI-9 in target cells had
no impact on the cytotoxic effect of either construct. Cellular expression of
MDR1 showed no cross-resistance to the fusion constructs. GrB-TWEAK and
GrB-Fc-IT4 activated intracellular caspase cascades and cytochrome c-related
proapoptotic pathways consistent with the known intracellular functions of GrB in
target cells. Treatment of mice bearing established HT-29 xenografts with
GrB-TWEAK showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared with vehicle alone 
(P < 0.05). Both GrB-TWEAK and GrB-Fc-IT4 displayed significant tumor growth
inhibition when administered to mice bearing orthotopic MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) tumor
xenografts. The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis revealed that Fn14 mRNA expression
was significantly higher in TNBC and in HER2-positive disease (P < 0.0001)
compared with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, and in basal-like 2 tumors
(P = 0.01) compared with other TNBC molecular subtypes. IHC analysis of a 101
patient TNBC tumor microarray showed that 55 of 101 (54%) of tumors stained
positive for Fn14, suggesting that this may be an excellent potential target for 
precision therapeutic approaches. Targeting Fn14 using fully human,
GrB-containing fusion constructs may form the basis for a new class of novel,
potent, and highly effective constructs for targeted therapeutic applications.

The mechanism underlying the aggressive behaviors of triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) is not well characterized yet. The association between cancer stem 
cell (CSC) population and the aggressive behaviors of TNBC has not been
established. We found the CD44(+)/CD24(-) cell population was enriched in TNBC
tissues and cell lines, with a higher capacity of proliferation, migration,
invasion and tumorigenicity as well as lower adhesion ability. The
CD44(+)/CD24(-) cell population with cancer stem cell-like properties may play an
important role in the aggressive behaviors of TNBC. This discovery may lead to
new therapeutic strategies targeting CD44(+)/CD24(-) cell population in TNBC.

TNBC vs non-TNBC: A retrospective review of differences in mean age, family
history, smoking history, and stage at diagnosis.

(1)University of Florida College of Medicine, Jacksonville, Florida.

PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare mean age, ethnicity, smoking history,
family history of breast cancer, and stage at diagnosis in patients with
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) vs non-TNBC at an inner city university
program.
METHODS: We reviewed data in our tumor registry on patients seen between January 
2000 and December 2005, and identified a total of 445 patients with various
subtypes of breast cancers. Of these, 342 patients met our study criteria.
Thirty-nine patients had TNBC and 303 had non-TNBC.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 59.87 ± 15.67 years for TNBC and 60.09 ±
13.98 years for non-TNBC (P=.9272). TNBC was more common in black than in white
patients (58.97% vs 35.90%; OR, 2.755; P=.004), and non-TNBC was more common in
white than in black patients (57.76% vs 39.27%). There was not a statistically
significant difference in past or present smoking between the TNBC and non-TNBC
patients (20.51% vs 27.72%; P=.4385). Family history of breast cancer was not
statistically related to TNBC status: a positive family history was reported in
30.77% of TNBC patients vs 33.33% of non-TNBC patients (P=.8384), no family
history was reported in 51.28% of TNBC patients vs 51.82% of non-TNBC patients,
and family history was unknown in 17.95% of TNBC patients vs 14.85% of non-TNBC
patients. Pathologic stage at the time of diagnosis was as follows for TNBC vs
non-TNBC patients: stage 0, 15.79% vs 11.37% (P=.4332); stage I, 34.21% vs 30.98%
(P=.6890); stage II, 28.98% vs 37.25% (P=.3205); stage III, 18.42% vs 17.25%
(P=.8591); and stage IV, 3.63% vs 3.14% (P=.8651).
CONCLUSION: We found that in our patient population, black women were
significantly more likely to have TNBC than non-TNBC, and white women were more
likely to have non-TNBC than TNBC.

Should triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype affect local-regional therapy
decision making?

Medicine, New Haven, CT.

The more aggressive biologic characteristics and the current lack of targeted
therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) make local-regional management
decisions challenging for physicians. TNBC is associated with patients of younger
age, black race and BRCA1 mutation carriers. Distinctions between
BRCA1-associated and sporadic TNBC include increased lifetime risk of ipsilateral
and contralateral breast cancer after breast cancer therapy (BCT) for BRCA
carriers, which is not shared by sporadic TNBC. However, the presence of a BRCA
mutation should not preclude a breast-conservation approach in patients who are
otherwise appropriate candidates for BCT. Data suggest that local-regional
relapse (LRR) at baseline after BCT appears to be comparable for TNBC and the
HER2-positive subgroups, but is about 50% greater than luminal tumors. LRR
appears to be similarly increased after mastectomy; thus, TNBC should not be a
contra-indication for BCT. Recent hypothesis-generating data suggest less LRR
after BCT (where radiation is routinely delivered) than with mastectomy for
early-stage TNBC. To date, no specific local-regional guideline recommendations
for TNBC exist. Level I outcome data for TNBC using accelerated partial breast
irradiation (APBI) and hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (hWBRT) are
lacking. TNBC should be treated with APBI only on clinical trials. Although hWBRT
may be considered in TNBC, its association with younger age, advanced disease and
use of systemic chemotherapy often precludes its use for this subtype. Until
definitive treatment strategies are validated in large datasets and confirmed in 
randomized trials, TNBC subtype, in and of itself, should not direct
local-regional management treatment decisions.

BACKGROUND: EndoTAG-1, composed of paclitaxel embedded in liposomal membranes
targeting tumor endothelial cells, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in
advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and forty patients were treated with weekly
EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m(2)) plus paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2)), twice weekly EndoTAG-1 (2×
44 mg/m(2)), or weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) for greater than or equal to four 
cycles (3-week treatment + 1-week rest) or until progression/toxicity. Primary
end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate evaluated centrally after four
cycles of therapy (week 16). The study was not powered for intergroup
comparisons.
RESULTS: The PFS rate at week 16 was 59.1% [one-sided 95% CI: 45.6, ∞] on
combination treatment, 34.2% [21.6, ∞] on EndoTAG-1, and 48.0% [30.5, ∞] on
paclitaxel. Median PFS reached 4.2, 3.4, and 3.7 months, respectively. After
complete treatment (week 41 analysis), median overall survival (OS) was 13.0,
11.9, and 13.1 months for the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and
15.1, 12.5, and 8.9 months for the per-protocol population, respectively. The
clinical benefit rate was 53%, 31%, and 36% for the treatment groups. Safety
analysis revealed known toxicities of the drugs with slight increases of grade
3/4 neutropenia on combination therapy.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of advanced TNBC with a combination of EndoTAG-1 and
standard paclitaxel [Taxol® (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH), or equivalent generic
formulation] was well tolerated and showed antitumor efficacy. The positive trend
needs to be confirmed in a randomized phase III trial.

Background: In recent years, breast cancer has been classified on the basis of
estrogen or progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status and whether the human epidermal 
growth factor 2 receptor (HER2/neu) protein is overexpressed. Based on this
system, breast cancer is broadly divided into the triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC) and the non-TNBC subtypes. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer, notable for
its propensity to metastasize early and display a comparatively more aggressive
course than its non-TNBC counterpart. Certain clinico-pathologic and demographic 
risk factors have been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we aim to
compare mean age, ethnicity, family history, tobacco use and stage at
presentation between TNBC and non-TNBC subtypes at our inner city university
program.
Methods: We reviewed data in our tumor registry between January 2000 and December
2005 with particular attention to mean age, race, family history, tobacco use and
stage at presentation. We found a total of 445 patients with various subtypes of 
breast cancers. We included only those patients in whom the status of both ER/PR 
and the status of Her2/neu protein overexpression were recorded. Our strict
selection criteria lead to an exclusion of about 103 patients. Out of the
remaining 342 patients, 39 were TNBC and 303 were non-TNBC.
Results: Mean age of onset for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients was 59.87 ± 15.67 years
vs. 60.09 ± 13.98 years respectively (P = 0.9272). In terms of ethnicity, TNBC
vs. non-TNBC patients had the following racial backgrounds: black, 58.97% vs.
39.27%; white, 35.90% vs. 57.76%; Chinese, 2.56% vs. 0.99%; others, 2.57% vs.
1.98% respectively (P = 0.004, OR = 2.755). Comparisons with respect to a history
of tobacco abuse for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients revealed a positive smoking
history in 20.51% vs. 27.72% whereas there was no former or current smoking
history in 71.79% vs. 61.72% respectively (P = 0.4385). Comparison of family
history of a breast cancer in TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients showed that positive
family history of breast cancer was seen in 30.77% vs. 33.33%, no family history 
of cancer was seen in 51.28% vs. 51.82% and unknown 17.95% vs. 14.85% (P =
0.8384). Pathologic stage at the time of diagnosis for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients
was as follows: stage 0, 15.79% vs. 11.37% (P = 0.4332); stage 1, 34.21% vs.
30.98% (P = 0.6890); stage 2, 28.98% vs. 37.25% (P = 0.3205); stage 3, 18.42% vs.
17.25% (P = 0.0.8591); and stage 4, 3.63% vs. 3.14% (P = 0.8651). Analysis using 
Chi-square test revealed χ2 value of 0.855.
Conclusion: Our results add to the growing body of evidence pertaining to the
association of certain demographic and clinico-pathologic characteristics in
women with breast cancer. We found that in our patient population, there is a
significant ethnic predisposition for the two types of breast cancers that we
studied. African Americans were more likely to have TNBC compared to the higher
frequency of non-TNBC in white females. We did not find a significant difference 
in mean age, cigarette smoking, family history and stage at diagnosis between the
TNBC and non-TNBC breast cancer patients. These findings are all consistent with 
the previously published research studies.

Prognostic value of survivin and EGFR protein expression in triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) patients.

Zhang M, Zhang X, Zhao S, Wang Y, Di W, Zhao G, Yang M, Zhang Q.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particular type of breast cancer which 
is characterized by its biological aggressiveness, worse prognosis, and lack of
prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in contrast with hormonal
receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+)
breast cancers. We aimed to evaluate survivin and epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) expression and their prognostic value and determine their
relationships with the clinicopathological parameters of TNBC. A total of 136
patients who had undergone a resection of primary TNBC were enrolled at the Third
Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from March 2003 to September
2005. Expression of ER, PR, HER2, EGFR, and survivin was assessed by
immunohistochemistry. The association of TNBC and other clinicopathological
variables and the prognostic value of survivin and EGFR expression were
evaluated. Survivin was expressed in 62 (45.6 %) cases and EGFR was expressed in 
82 (60.3 %) cases. Survivin expression was associated with menopausal status
(P = 0.011), tumor size (P = 0.037), and lymph node status (P = 0.001). EGFR
expression was associated with menopausal status (P = 0.029), lymph node status
(P = 0.004), P53 expression (P = 0.001), Ki-67 expression (P = 0.028), and
lymphatic vascular invasion (P = 0.037). A multivariate analysis demonstrated
that tumor size (hazard ratio (HR) 1.587, 95 % confidence interval (CI)
1.081–2.330, P = 0.018 for disease-free survival (DFS); HR 1.606, 95%CI
1.096–2.354, P = 0.015 for overall survival (OS)), lymph node status (HR 2.873,
95%CI 1.544–5.344, P = 0.001 for DFS; HR 2.915, 95%CI 1.553–5.471, P = 0.001 for 
OS), tumor grade (HR 1.914, 95%CI 1.218–3.007, P = 0.005 for DFS; HR 1.983, 95%CI
1.228–3.203, P = 0.005 for OS), EGFR (HR 3.008, 95%CI 1.331–6.792, P = 0.008 for 
DFS; HR 3.151, 95%CI 1.374–7.226, P = 0.007 for OS), and survivin (HR 1.573,
95%CI 1.087–2.277, P = 0.016 for DFS; HR 1.607, 95%CI 1.088–2.374, P = 0.017 for 
OS) were of prognostic significance for disease-free and overall survival. We
draw a conclusion from the present study that survivin and EGFR expression are
useful prognostic markers of TNBC and might be useful for molecular targeting
therapy of TNBC treatment.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of BRCA1 gene
aberrations in sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and its impact on
anthracycline-based therapy. BRCA1 promoter methylation was analyzed in 70 TNBC
and compared with the clinical and pathologic characteristics. As a control
group, we used 70 patients with non-TNBC. BRCA1 promoter methylation was observed
in 65.2 % of patients and was similar in both groups. BRCA1 promoter methylation 
was associated with decreased intensity of BRCA1 protein expression (P = 0.002)
and significant increase of median disease-free survival (DFS) of TNBC patients
receiving adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy (P = 0.001). Multivariate
analysis revealed that BRCA1 promoter methylation remains a favorable factor in
regard to DFS (HR 0.224; 95 % CI 0.092-0.546, P = 0.001) in TNBC after adjustment
for other prognostic factors. In contrast, in non-TNBC, BRCA1 promoter
methylation was not associated with any clinical and pathologic parameters. BRCA1
promoter methylation is a common mechanism of BRCA1 gene aberration in sporadic
breast cancer and is predictive for better response to anthracycline-based
therapies.

Feline mammary basal-like adenocarcinomas: a potential model for human
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with basal-like subtype.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an immunophenotype defined by the absence
of immunolabeling for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2
protein, has a highly aggressive behavior. A subpopulation of TNBCs exhibit a
basal-like morphology with immunohistochemical positivity for cytokeratins 5/6
(CK5/6) and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and have a high incidence
of BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility) mutations. Feline mammary adenocarcinomas 
(FMAs) are highly malignant and share a similar basal-like subtype. The purpose
of this study was to classify FMAs according to the current human classification 
of breast cancer that includes evaluation of ER, PR and HER2 status and
expression of basal CK 5/6 and EGFR. Furthermore, we selected triple negative,
basal-like FMAs to screen for BRCA mutations similar to those described in human 
TNBC.
METHODS: Twenty four FMAs were classified according to the current human
histologic breast cancer classification including immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 
ER, PR HER2, CK5/6 and EGFR. Genetic alteration and loss of heterozygosity of
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were analyzed in triple negative, basal-like FMAs.
RESULTS: IHC for ER, PR and HER2 identified 14 of the 24 (58%) FMAs as a triple
negative. Furthermore, 11 of these 14 (79%) triple negative FMAs had a basal-like
subtype. However, no genetic abnormalities were detected in BRCA1 and BRCA2 by
direct sequencing and loss of heterozygosity analysis.
CONCLUSION: FMAs are highly aggressive neoplasms that are commonly triple
negative and exhibit a basal-like morphology. This is similar to human TNBC that 
are also commonly classified as a basal-like subtype. While sequencing of a
select number of triple negative, basal-like FMAs and testing for loss of
heterozygosity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 did not identify mutations similar to those
described in human TNBC, further in-depth evaluation is required to elucidate a
potential role of BRCA in the tumorigenesis of triple negative, basal-like FMAs. 
The strong similarities in clinical behavior, morphology and IHC phenotype
suggest that triple negative, basal-like FMAs may be a suitable spontaneous
animal model for studying novel therapeutic approaches against human basal-like
TNBC.

BACKGROUND: BRCA1-associated breast cancers have been associated to a
triple-negative phenotype. The prevalence of BRCA1 germline mutations in young
onset TNBC based on informativeness of family history has not been reported.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2008 to May 2009 were collected blood and
tumor samples from patients with TNBC younger than 50 years and without a family 
history of breast and ovarian cancer in first- and second-degree relatives.
Analysis of BRCA1 germline mutations was made. Age at diagnosis and
informativeness of family history (presence of female in first- and second-degree
relatives alive until age 45) was collected in all cases. Immunohistochemistry of
basal-like features was performed centrally in all available tumors.
RESULTS: Seven pathogenic mutations were detected in 92 patients (7.6 %), two of 
them in patients younger than 35 years (28.6 %) (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.631).
Three non-classified variants were detected (3.2 %). Family history was
informative in two patients with a pathogenic mutation (28.6 %) and not
informative in five (71.4 %) (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.121). Of the seven
patients with a pathogenic mutation, four had a basal-like phenotype.
CONCLUSION: Patients with apparently sporadic TNBC younger than 50 years and a
non-informative family history are candidates for germline genetic testing of
BRCA1.

BACKGROUND: Revised NCCN guidelines recommend that women ≤60 years with
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) be referred for consideration of genetic
counseling. Small, homogeneous samples have limited evaluation of BRCA mutation
prevalence among different ethnicities affected by TNBC subtype. We sought to
determine whether the prevalence of BRCA mutations within a TNBC cohort differs
by demographic factors.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with TNBC referred for
genetic counseling at two academic Hereditary Cancer Clinics between 2000 and
2012. Demographic data were collected, including age at diagnosis and
race/ethnicity. Race was categorized as African American (AA), Ashkenazi Jewish
(AJ), Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, or other. Primary outcome was BRCA mutation
status, analyzed by race/ethnicity and age at diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 469 patients with TNBC who underwent testing for BRCA genetic
mutations were identified, of which 450 patients had evaluable BRCA testing
results; 139 (30.8 %) had confirmed BRCA1 (n = 106) or BRCA2 (n = 32) mutations. 
BRCA mutation prevalence differed by ethnicity and race: AA (20.4 %), AJ (50 %), 
Asian (28.5 %), Caucasian (33.3 %), and Hispanic (20 %). The prevalence of
genetic mutations also differed by age at diagnosis: <40 years (43.8 %), 40-49
years (27.4 %), 50-59 years (25.3 %), 60-69 years (12.5 %), and >70 years (16.6
%).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of genetic mutations among women with TNBC referred
for genetic counseling is high and differs significantly by ethnicity/race and
age. This data helps to refine mutation risk estimates among women with TNBC,
allowing for more personalized genetic counseling potentially aiding in improved 
patient decision-making.

Primary TNBCs are treated as if they were a single disease entity, yet it is
clear they do not behave as a single entity in response to current therapies.
Recently, we reported that statins might have a potential benefit for TNBCs
associated with ets-1 overexpression. The aim of this study is to investigate the
role of PTEN loss in the effects of statin on TNBC cells. In addition, we analyze
the relationship between AKT downstream pathways and the effects of statin on
TNBC cells. We investigated the effect of a statin on TNBC cells and analyzed the
association of PI3K pathways using various TNBC cells in terms of PTEN loss and
AKT pathways. Simvastatin treatments resulted in decreased cell viabilities in
various TNBC cell lines. Compared with PTEN wild-type TNBC cells, PTEN
mutant-type TNBC cells showed a decreased response to simvastatin. Expressions of
phosphorylated Akt and total Akt showed an inverse relationship with PTEN
expression. The TNBC cell lines, which showed increased expression of p-Akt,
appeared to attenuate the expression of p-Akt by PTEN loss in simvastatin-treated
TNBC cells. The Akt inhibitor, LY294002, augmented the effect of simvastatin on
PTEN wild-type TNBC cells. Simvastatin induces inhibition of TNBC cells via PI3K 
pathway activation.

Bcl2 is an independent prognostic marker of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
and predicts response to anthracycline combination (ATC) chemotherapy (CT) in
adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.

BACKGROUND: TNBC represents a heterogeneous subgroup of BC with poor prognosis
and frequently resistant to CT.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The relationship between Bcl2 immunohistochemical protein
expression and clinico-pathological outcomes was assessed in 736 TNBC-patients:
635 patients had early primary-TNBC (EP-TNBC) and 101 had primary locally
advanced (PLA)-TNBC treated with neo-adjuvant- ATC-CT.
RESULTS: Negative Bcl2 (Bcl2-) was observed in 70% of EP-TNBC and was
significantly associated with high proliferation, high levels of P-Cadherin,
E-Cadherin and HER3 (P's < 0.01), while Bcl2+ was significantly associated with
high levels of p27, MDM4 and SPAG5 (P < 0.01). After controlling for chemotherapy
and other prognostic factors, Bcl2- was associated with 2-fold increased risk of 
death (P = 0.006) and recurrence (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, the prognosis of
EP-TNBC/Bcl2- patients had improved both BC-specific survival (P = 0.002) and
disease-free survival (P = 0.003), if they received adjuvant-ATC-CT. Moreover,
Bcl2- expression was an independent predictor of pathological complete response
of primary locally advanced triple negative breast cancer (PLA-TNBC) treated with
neoadjuvant-ATC-CT (P = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Adding Bcl2 to the panel of markers used in current clinical practice
could provide both prognostic and predictive information in TNBC. TNBC/Bcl2-
patients appear to benefit from ATC-CT, whereas Bcl2+ TNBC seems to be resistant 
to ATC-CT and may benefit from a trial of different type of chemotherapy
with/without novel-targeted agents.

treated at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between July 
2002 and December 2011 were collected. Patients were divided into two groups:
those with TNBC and those with other types of breast cancer. Patients and tumor
characteristics were compared between the two groups using the Chi-square test.
The prognostic results of 9,823 patients in the study population were also
analyzed to determine long-term survival rates in the two groups of breast cancer
patients.
RESULTS: Among the breast cancer patients treated in our hospital between 2003
and 2011, 10.4%-13.5% of them had triple-negative breast cancers. Data analyses
revealed significant differences in disease onset age, family history of breast
cancer, tumor size, tumor histologic grade, lymph note positivity and metastatic 
status between TNBC and non-TNBC patients. There were also significant
differences in 5-year, 7-year and 9-year disease-free and 7-year and 9-year
overall survival probability between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: TNBC are associated with younger disease onset age, larger tumor
size, higher rate of axillary lymph node positivity, and higher tumor histologic 
grade. TNBC is also related to family history of breast cancer, increased
metastatic risk and poor prognosis.

PURPOSE: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are associated with an adverse
outcome, although these tumors are sensitive to chemotherapy. In part, this
phenomenon could be caused by tumor immune escape. The current study investigates
immunogenicity of TNBC cells in vitro and the presence of immunosuppressive
factors in the tumor microenvironment (pAKT and B7H1 expression, infiltration
with regulatory T cells, [Tregs]).
METHODS: Natural killer (NK)-cell induced lysis was evaluated in estrogen
receptor (ER) positive MCF 7 breast cancers, in MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 and in
HCC-1937 (BRCA 1 mutated) and HCC-1806 TNBC cells. Expression of pAKT, B7H1 and
infiltration with Tregs were determined by immunohistochemistry in human
specimens of benign and malignant breast disease.
RESULTS: NK-cell induced lysis was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in four
TNBC cell lines compared to ER + MCF 7 cells. Fibroadenomas and mastectomy
samples were not infiltrated with Tregs. Infiltration with Tregs was 0.92 ± 0.21 
in ER/PR + breast cancers and significantly higher in TNBC without (2.30 ± 0.34) 
and also significantly higher with mutation of BRCA 1 (2.10 ± 0.34). Expression
of pAKT was absent in benign controls and 1.23 ± 0.36 in ER/PR + breast cancers, 
1.78 ± 0.40 in TNBC without and 2.40 ± 0.30 with mutated BRCA 1. No significant
differences of B7H1 expression occurred among the breast cancer subgroups.
CONCLUSION: TNBC cell stimulate the NK-cell immune response significantly
stronger than ER positive breast cancer cells. This could explain why
infiltration with immunosuppressive Tregs is increased in human specimens of TNBC
with and without mutated BRCA 1. Accordingly, immunomodulatory treatment
strategies should be further explored in TNBC.

breast cancers.

Recent literature suggests that sEcad exerts pro-oncogenic effects, possibly
acting as a ligand for the human epidermal growth factor family. Here we show
that sEcad is a novel candidate protein for drug targeting since it is increased 
in human and mouse HER2-positive (HER2+) breast tumors, MMTV-PyMT bodily fluids
and human cell culture systems. Mechanistically, we show that endogenous sEcad,
and to a lesser extent membrane-bound E-cadherin, associates with HER1, HER2, and
HER3 in human and MMTV-PyMT mouse HER2+ tumors and with HER1 in triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) specimens. Furthermore, addition of exogenous recombinant
human E-cadherin/Fc chimeric protein (rhEcad/Fc; sEcad) to HER2+ MCF-7, SKBR3,
and HER2-negative MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells, resulted in sEcad-HER receptor family
interactions, activation of HER1-4 and downstream pro-survival signaling,
including the MAPK-PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways and IAP family members. Lastly, we
demonstrate that sEcad exerts pro-oncogenic effects via HER signaling, and acts
additively with the HER ligand EGF to promote HER2+ breast cancer proliferation
and migration, as well as TNBC invasion. Because sEcad associates and activates
many of the oncogenic pathways that tumors utilize for growth and survival and
serum levels in patients correlates with clinical response, suggests that
targeted therapy against sEcad in combination with other therapies may
potentially offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast
cancers.

The most lethal damage for the cell among all damage is double-strand breaks
(DSB) of DNA. DSB cause development of cancer diseases including the
triple-negative molecular subtype of breast cancer. The aim of this work was to
evaluate the single nucleotide polymorphism -135G>C (rs1801320) of the RAD51 gene
encoding DNA repair proteins by homologous recombination (HR) in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC). We assessed the RAD51 -135G>C polymorphism in 50 women with
triple-negative breast cancer and in 50 women from the control group. RAD51
polymorphism was analysed by the PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length
polymorphism) technique. Our results demonstrated a significant positive
association between the RAD51 C/C genotype and TNBC, with an adjusted odds ratio 
(OR) of 5.95 (p = 0.002). The homozygous C/C genotype was found in 68% of breast 
cancer cases and 20% of controls. The variant 135C allele of RAD51 increased TNBC
risk. This is the first study linking single nucleotide polymorphisms of the
RAD51 gene with TNBC incidence in the population of Polish women. In conclusion, 
RAD51 polymorphisms may be regarded as predictive factors of triple-negative
breast cancer in the female population. Large studies are needed to confirm our
findings.

The aim of this study was to investigate expression of CD147 and MMP-9 in
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) so as to determine whether these two
proteins may be correlated with poor prognosis of TNBC patients. We examined the 
expression levels of the CD147 and MMP-9 in 127 patients with TNBC and 30
patients with mammary gland fibroma using immunohistochemical staining before any
treatments. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of
these two proteins and various clinicopathologic factors including survival
status of patients with TNBC. Positive stain of CD147 and MMP-9 was observed in
all samples of TNBC. A statistically positive correlation was observed between
the expression levels of CD147 and MMP-9 in TNBC tissues. The incidences of high 
expression were 48.0 % for CD147 and 53.5 % for MMP-9 in 127 TNBC tissues,
respectively. High expression of either CD147 or MMP-9 was significantly
correlated with clinical feature and shorter progression-free survival (PFS)
(P(CD147) = 0.039; P(MMP-9) = 0.017) and overall survival (OS) (P(CD147) = 0.037;
P(MMP-9) = 0.023). The expression levels of CD147 and MMP-9 are positively
correlated with invasion, metastasis and shorter PFS/OS of TNBC. Patients with
high expression of CD147 and MMP-9 had poor prognosis than TNBC patients with low
expression.

In the normal rodent breast, the pineal hormone melatonin controls the
development of ductal and alveolar tissue. Melatonin counteracts tumor occurrence
and tumor cell progression in vivo and in vitro in animal and human breast cancer
cell cultures. It acts predominantly through its melatonin MT1 receptor. Our aim 
was to investigate the presence or absence of the MT1 melatonin receptor in the
aggressive triple negative group of human breast carcinoma (TNBC) and its
possible relationship to the course of the disease. A total of 167 patients with 
a ER-, PR-, Her-2/neu- phenotype in which tissue for receptor studies was
available were examined. The MT1 receptor immunostain was evaluated
semiquantitatively as staining intensity (0, 1, 2, 3), percentage of stained
cells and the weighted index (WI) (staining intensity times percentage of stained
cells). A score of WI < 60 was regarded as "negative". There was a striking
difference in incidence of MT1 positivity and staining intensity between
carcinomas in African American (AA) and Caucasian (C) women. The AA showed a
higher incidence of MT1 negative tumors (41/84 = 48.8 % in AA, 6/51 = 11.8 % in
C) and a lower average WI. MT1 positivity in TNBC was associated with a lower
stage and a smaller tumor size at time of diagnosis. In multivariable survival
analysis, MT1 negative TNBC in all cases regardless of race showed a
significantly higher hazard ratio for disease progression, shorter progression
free survival, and disease-related death, and shorter OS. This was especially
pronounced in the AA group but did not reach statistical significance in the
smaller group of C alone. These results suggest that melatonin or a melatonin
receptor agonist may be useful biologic additions in the treatment of some forms 
of TNBC, especially in AA who generally show a more aggressive course of their
disease.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides a means both of improving subsequent surgical
intervention and of testing novel therapies or combinations. Historically,
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has responded well in the neoadjuvant
setting, with rates of pathological complete response (pCR) commonly higher than 
for other breast tumour types. However, more than half of TNBC patients do not
achieve a pCR and have a very poor prognosis. The lack of drug-targetable
receptors on TNBC tumours has made improving the available interventions in TNBC 
an area of important medical need. The routine use of neoadjuvant
anthracycline/taxane combinations in TNBC is currently being supplemented by
ongoing investigations of their use with other types of agent. In particular, the
substantial proportion of TNBC tumours associated with BRCA1 mutations is driving
clinical research into the use of DNA-damaging agents such as platinums, as well 
as of potentiators of DNA damage such as the investigational agent iniparib and
inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerase such as olaparib. Tyrosine kinase
receptor inhibitors and microtubule-targeting inhibitors of cell cycling are also
under active investigation. The use of neoadjuvant treatment with pCR as a
surrogate of overall survival will allow the rapid evaluation and comparison of
these and other much-needed new treatments for TNBC.

Search for novel therapies for triple negative breast cancers (TNBC): analogs of 
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and growth hormone-releasing hormone
(GHRH).

Buchholz S, Seitz S, Engel JB, Montero A, Ortmann O, Perez R, Block NL, Schally
AV.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that 
is clinically negative for the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors 
(ER/PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Patients with TNBC
have a worse clinical outcome, as measured by time to metastasis and median
overall survival. Chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment of TNBC but
responses are disappointing. A substantial proportion of TNBC expresses
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), receptors for LHRH, in addition to 
receptors for growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). These receptors represent 
potential therapeutic targets. Potent antagonists of GHRH and LHRH receptors have
been developed in recent years and these antagonists inhibit the growth,
tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of various human experimental
malignancies. These antagonists could be utilized for the treatment of TNBC. The 
targeted cytotoxic analog of LHRH, AN-152 (AEZS-108) containing doxorubicin, must
also be strongly considered for therapy of TNBC. Experimental studies suggest the
merit of clinical trials with LHRH antagonists and AEZS-108 in TNBC patients.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibit characteristics quite
distinct from other kinds of breast cancer, presenting as an aggressive
disease--recurring and metastasizing more often than other kinds of breast
cancer, without tumor-specific treatment options and accounts for 15% of all
types of breast cancer with higher percentages in premenopausal African-American 
and Hispanic women. The reason for this aggressive phenotype is currently the
focus of intensive research. However, progress is hampered by the lack of
suitable TNBC cell model systems.
METHODS: To understand the mechanistic basis for the aggressiveness of TNBC, we
produced a stable TNBC cell line by sorting for 4T1 cells that do not express the
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) or the gene for human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). As a control, we produced a stable
triple-positive breast cancer (TPBC) cell line by transfecting 4T1 cells with rat
HER2, ER and PgR genes and sorted for cells with high expression of ER and PgR by
flow cytometry and high expression of the HER2 gene by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: We isolated tumor-initiating cells (TICs) by sorting for
CD24+/CD44high/ALDH1+ cells from TNBC (TNBC-TICs) and TPBC (TPBC-TICs) stable
cell lines. Limiting dilution transplantation experiments revealed that
CD24+/CD44high/ALDH1+ cells derived from TNBC (TNBC-TICs) and TPBC (TPBC-TICs)
were significantly more effective at repopulating the mammary glands of naïve
female BALB/c mice than CD24-/CD44-/ALDH1- cells. Implantation of the TNBC-TICs
resulted in significantly larger tumors, which metastasized to the lungs to a
significantly greater extent than TNBC, TPBC-TICs, TPBC or parental 4T1 cells. We
further demonstrated that the increased aggressiveness of TNBC-TICs correlates
with the presence of high levels of mouse twenty-five kDa heat shock protein
(Hsp25/mouse HspB1) and seventy-two kDa heat shock protein (Hsp72/HspA1A).
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we have developed a TNBC-TICs model system based on 
the 4T1 cells which is a very useful metastasis model with the advantage of being
able to be transplanted into immune competent recipients. Our data demonstrates
that the TNBC-TICs model system could be a useful tool for studies on the
pathogenesis and therapeutic treatment for TNBC.

PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits a distinct pattern of
recurrence characterized by a rapidly rising rate in the first 2 years with a
peak at 2-3 years, followed by a decline over the next 5 years. However, some
TNBC patients exhibit indolent clinical behavior. The aim of this study was to
investigate clinical characteristics and outcomes of metastatic TNBCs. In
addition, we were to find out the marker which could divide TNBCs into a few
subgroups according to different clinical features.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics and
outcomes of patients with metastatic TNBC who received palliative treatment
between 1999 and 2007.
RESULTS: The median relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of 152 
patients were 24 and 20 months, respectively. Divided TNBCs based on a RFS of
36 months, the patients with a RFS of ≥36 months had a better disease control
rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS than those with a RFS of
<3 years. Cox-regression multivariate analysis for RFS and OS revealed EGFR
positivity and a low BRCA1 score as an independent risk factor for OS.
CONCLUSIONS: The patients with a RFS ≥ 3 years had a significantly better DCR,
PFS, and OS than patients who had a RFS < 3 years. BRCA1 and EGFR expression may 
be candidate determinants to distinguish RFS. A prospective clinical trial for
different therapeutic strategies is needed for each subgroup.

Breast cancer is not considered anymore a unique disease. Microarray gene
expression analysis led to the identification of 4 major breast cancer
"intrinsic" subtypes, including hormone receptor (HR)-positive luminal A and B,
human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and basal-like breast cancer
(BLBC). These subtypes have distinct phenotypes, molecular profiles, clinical
behaviour and response to therapy, with the BLBC carrying the worst outcome.
Microarray analysis is not feasible in routine practice and therefore oncologists
rely on a simpler immunohistochemical (IHC) classification to identify relevant
breast cancer subtypes. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the
absence of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 expression at IHC
analysis. TNBC is strictly related to BLBC and, given the lack of common
therapeutic targets, represent a major challenge for breast oncologist. In this
review we will summarize the updated knowledge on TNBC, with emphasis on its
current treatment and on the new therapeutic options under development.
