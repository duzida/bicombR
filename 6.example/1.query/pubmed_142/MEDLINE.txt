TI  - Class I histone deacetylase inhibitor suppresses vasculogenic mimicry by
      enhancing the expression of tumor suppressor and anti-angiogenesis genes in
      aggressive human TNBC cells.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2019.4796 [doi]
AB  - Triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) cells form angiogenesisindependent vessellike
      structures to survive, known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM), contributing to a poor
      prognosis for cancer patients. Nuclear localized class I histone deacetylases
      (HDACs) enzymes, particularly HDACs 1, 2, 3 deacetylate chromatin histones, are
      overexpressed in cancers and epigenetically regulate the expression of genes
      involved in cancer initiation and progression. The specific HDAC inhibitor,
      entinostat, has been shown to attenuate tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC.
      In this study, we hypothesized that entinostat would enhance the expression of
      antiangiogenic and tumor suppressor genes and would thus suppress VM structures
      in TNBC cells in a 3D Matrigel cell culture preclinical model. Our data indicated
      that invasive triplenegative MDAMB231, LM24 and BT549 breast cancer cells, but
      not poorly invasive luminal MCF7 cells, efficiently underwent matrixassociated VM
      formation. Approximately 80% of TNBC cells with the stem cell phenotype potential
      formed vessellike structures when mixed with Matrigel and cultured in the low
      attachment tissue culture plate. The molecular mechanisms of VM formation are
      rather complex, while angiogenesis inhibitor genes are downregulated and
      proangiogenesis genes are upregulated in VMforming cells. Our data revealed that 
      treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat epigenetically led to
      the reexpression of the antiangiogenic genes, serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1)
      and thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), and to that of the tumor suppressor genes,
      phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and p21, and reduced VM structures. We also
      found that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells with entinostat downregulated
      the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and that of the
      epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)related genes, Vimentin and betacatenin.
      METABIRC and TCGA breast cancer cohort mRNA expression data analysis revealed
      that a high expression of the antiangiogenesisassociated genes, THBS2, SERPINF1
      and serpin family B member 5 (SERPINB5), and of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, 
      was associated with a better overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients.
      Taken together, the findings of this study demonstrate that HDACs 1, 2, 3 partly 
      contribute to VM formation in TNBC cells; thus, HDACs may be an important
      therapeutic target for TNBC.

AB  - Treatment options are limited for patients with triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC). Understanding genes that participate in cancer progression and DNA damage
      response (DDR) may improve therapeutic strategies for TNBC. DAXX, a death
      domain-associated protein, has been reported to be critically involved in cancer 
      progression and drug sensitivity in multiple cancer types. However, its role in
      breast cancer, especially for TNBC, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated a
      tumor suppressor function of DAXX in TNBC proliferation, colony formation, and
      migration. In Mouse Xenograft Models, DAXX remarkably inhibited tumorigenicity of
      TNBC cells. Mechanistically, DAXX could directly bind to the promoter region of
      RAD51 and impede DNA damage repair, which impacted the protection mechanism of
      tumor cells that much depended on remaining DDR pathways for cell growth.
      Furthermore, DAXX-mediated inefficient DNA damage repair could sensitize
      BRCA-proficient TNBC cells to PARP inhibitors. Additionally, we identified that
      dual RAD51 and PARP inhibition with RI-1 and ABT888 significantly reduced TNBC
      growth both in vitro and in vivo, which provided the first evidence of combining 
      RAD51 and PARP inhibition in BRCA-proficient TNBC. In conclusion, our data
      support DAXX as a modulator of DNA damage repair and suppressor of TNBC
      progression to sensitize tumors to the PARP inhibitor by repressing RAD51
      functions. These provide an effective strategy for a better application of PARP
      inhibition in the treatment of TNBC.

TI  - The pro- and anti-tumor roles of mesenchymal stem cells toward
      BRCA1-IRIS-overexpressing TNBC cells.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s13058-019-1131-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cross-talk between BRCA1-IRIS (IRIS)-overexpressing
      (IRISOE) TNBC cells and tumor-resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that
      triggers the aggressiveness or elimination of IRISOE TNBC tumors. METHODS: We
      analyzed the effect of silencing or inactivating IRIS on the bi-directional
      interaction between IRISOE TNBC cells and MSCs on tumor formation and
      progression. We analyzed the downstream signaling in MSCs induced by IL-6
      secreted from IRISOE TNBC cells. We compared the effect of MSCs on the formation 
      and progression of IRIS-proficient and deficient-TNBC cells/tumors using in vitro
      and in vivo models. Finally, we analyzed the association between IL-6, PTGER2,
      and PTGER4 overexpression and breast cancer subtype; hormone receptor status; and
      distant metastasis-free or overall survival. RESULTS: We show high-level IL-6
      secreted from IRISOE TNBC cells that enhances expression of its receptor (IL-6R) 
      in MSCs, their proliferation, and migration toward IRISOE, in vitro, and
      recruitment into IRISOE TNBC tumors, in vivo. In serum-free medium, recombinant
      IL-6 and the IL-6-rich IRISOE TNBC cell condition media (CM) decreased
      STAT3(Y705) phosphorylation (p-STAT3(Y705)) in MSCs. Inhibiting IRIS expression
      or activity prolonged STAT3(Y705) phosphorylation in MSCs. The interaction with
      IRISOE TNBC cells skewed MSC differentiation toward prostaglandin E2
      (PGE2)-secreting pro-aggressiveness cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).
      Accordingly, co-injecting human or mouse MSCs with IRISOE TNBC tumor cells
      promoted the formation of aggressive mammary tumors, high circulating IL-6 and
      PGE2 levels, and reduced overall survival. In contrast, IRIS-silenced or
      inactivated cells showed reduced tumor formation ability, limited MSC recruitment
      into tumors, reduced circulating IL-6 and PGE2 levels, and prolonged overall
      survival. A positive correlation between IL-6, PTGER2, and PTGER4 expression and 
      basal phenotype; ER-negativity; distant metastasis-free and overall survival in
      basal; or BRCA(mutant) carriers was observed. Finally, the bi-directional
      interaction with MSCs triggered death rather than growth of IRIS-silenced TNBC
      cells, in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-6/PGE2-positive feedback loop
      between IRISOE TNBC tumor cells and MSCs enhances tumor aggressiveness.
      Inhibiting IRIS expression limits TNBC tumor growth and progression through an
      MSC-induced death of IRIS-silenced/inactivated TNBC cells.

AB  - NRON mediates the degradation of tat protein to participate in HIV-1 infection.
      Interesting, our study observed the downregulation of NRON in triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) tissues compared with paired adjacent healthy tissues. In
      contrast, lncRNA snaR was upregulated in TNBC tissues and was inversely
      correlated with NRON. Expression levels of snaR increased, while expression
      levels of NRON decreased along with the increase of clinical stages. snaR
      overexpression resulted in promoted cancer cell proliferation but did not
      significantly affect NRON expression. NRON overexpression inhibited cancer cell
      proliferation and downregulated snaR. SnaR overexpression reduced the effects of 
      NRON overexpression. We therefore conclude that NRON may downregulate lncRNA snaR
      to inhibit cancer cell proliferation in TNBC.

TI  - Inhibition of USP2 eliminates cancer stem cells and enhances TNBC responsiveness 
      to chemotherapy.
PG  - 285
LID - 10.1038/s41419-019-1512-6 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast
      cancer that harbors enriched cancer stem cell (CSC) populations in tumors.
      Conventional chemotherapy is a standard treatment for TNBC, but it spares the CSC
      populations, which cause tumor recurrence and progression. Therefore,
      identification of the core molecular pathway that controls CSC activity and
      expansion is essential for developing effective therapeutics for TNBC. In this
      study, we identify that USP2 deubiquitinating enzyme is upregulated in CSCs and
      is a novel regulator of CSCs. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of USP2
      substantially inhibits the self-renewal, expansion and chemoresistance of CSCs.
      We show that USP2 maintains the CSC population by activating self-renewing factor
      Bmi1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through Twist upregulation.
      Mechanistically, USP2 promotes Twist stabilization by removing beta-TrCP-mediated
      ubiquitination of Twist. Animal studies indicate that pharmacological inhibition 
      of USP2 suppresses tumor progression and sensitizes tumor responses to
      chemotherapy in TNBC. Furthermore, the histological analyses reveal a positive
      correlation between USP2 upregulation and lymph node metastasis. Our findings
      together demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of USP2 in mediating Twist
      activation and CSC enrichment, suggesting that targeting USP2 is a novel
      therapeutic strategy to tackle TNBC.

AB  - The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a more aggressive
      nature and poorer prognosis, nowadays none pharmaceutical approach is still
      available. For this reason, the research of new active compounds and attractive
      targets represents an interesting field. In this context MDA- MB-231 cell line
      was selected to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of new
      [1,2-a]-pyrroloquinoxaline derivatives. The MTT assay revealed that the amine
      forms of synthesized molecules were more active compared to iminic ones at 72 h
      of incubation. The antiproliferative effect of the most promising compounds
      highlighted the formation of autophagic vacuoles.

TI  - EGCG-Derivative G28 Shows High Efficacy Inhibiting the Mammosphere-Forming
      Capacity of Sensitive and Resistant TNBC Models.
LID - E1027 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules24061027 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies showed that Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN), a lipogenic enzyme
      overexpressed in several carcinomas, plays an important role in drug resistance. 
      Furthermore, the enrichment of Breast Cancer Stem Cell (BCSC) features has been
      found in breast tumors that progressed after chemotherapy. Hence, we used the
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 (231) to evaluate the
      FASN and BCSC population role in resistance acquisition to chemotherapy. For this
      reason, parental cell line (231) and its derivatives resistant to doxorubicin
      (231DXR) and paclitaxel (231PTR) were used. The Mammosphere-Forming Assay and
      aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity assay showed an increase in BCSCs
      in the doxorubicin-resistant model. Moreover, the expression of some
      transcription factors involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
      process that confers BCSC characteristics, was upregulated after chemotherapy
      treatment. FASN inhibitors C75, (-)-Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), and its
      synthetic derivatives G28, G56 and G37 were used to evaluate the effect of FASN
      inhibition on the BCSC-enriched population in our cell lines. G28 showed a
      noticeable antiproliferative effect in adherent conditions and, interestingly, a 
      high mammosphere-forming inhibition capacity in all cell models. Our preliminary 
      results highlight the importance of studying FASN inhibitors for the treatment of
      TNBC patients, especially those who progress after chemotherapy.

TI  - Genetic alterations of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in women from
      Northeastern Mexico.
PG  - 3581-3588
LID - 10.3892/ol.2019.9984 [doi]
AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer of
      heterogeneous nature that is negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
      receptor (PR) and growth factor human epidermal 2 (HER2) following
      immunohistochemical analysis. TNBC is frequently characterized by relapse and
      reduced survival. To date, there is no targeted therapy for this type of cancer. 
      Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery remain as the standard treatments
      options. The lack of a target therapy and the heterogeneity of TNBC highlight the
      need to seek new therapeutic options. In this study, fresh tissue samples of TNBC
      were analyzed with a panel of 48 driver genes (212 amplicons) that are likely to 
      be therapeutic targets. We found intron variants, missense, stop gained and
      splicing variants in TP53, PIK3CA and FLT3 genes. Interestingly, all the analyzed
      samples had at least two variants in the TP53 gene, one being a drug response
      variant, rs1042522, found in 94% of our samples. We also found seven additional
      variants not previously reported in the TP53 gene, to the best of our knowledge, 
      with probable deleterious characteristics of the tumor suppressor gene. We found 
      four genetic variants in the PIK3CA gene, including two missense variants. The
      rs2491231 variant in the FLT3 gene was identified in 84% (16/19) of the samples, 
      which not yet reported for TNBC, to the best of our knowledge. In conclusion,
      genetic variants in TP53 were found in all TNBC tumors, with rs1042522 being the 
      most frequent (94% of TNBC biopsies), which had not been previously reported in
      TNBC. Also, we found two missense variants in the PIK3CA gene. These results
      justify the validation of these genetic variants in a large cohort, as well as
      the extensive study of their impact on the prognosis and therapy management of
      TBNC.

TI  - The Novel Mnk1/2 Degrader and Apoptosis Inducer VNLG-152 Potently Inhibits TNBC
      Tumor Growth and Metastasis.
LID - E299 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers11030299 [doi]
AB  - Currently, there are no effective therapies for patients with triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive and highly metastatic disease. Activation of 
      eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) by mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK)-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (Mnk1/2) play a critical role in the
      development, progression and metastasis of TNBC. Herein, we undertook a
      comprehensive study to evaluate the activity of a first-in-class Mnk1/2 protein
      degraders, racemic VNLG-152R and its two enantiomers (VNLG-152E1 and VNLG-152E2) 
      in in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC. These studies enabled us to identify
      racemic VNLG-152R as the most efficacious Mnk1/2 degrader, superior to its pure
      enantiomers. By targeting Mnk1/2 protein degradation (activity), VNLG-152R
      potently inhibited both Mnk-eIF4E and mTORC1 signaling pathways and strongly
      regulated downstream factors involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis,
      pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines secretion, epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) and metastasis. Most importantly, orally bioavailable VNLG-152R 
      exhibited remarkable antitumor (91 to 100% growth inhibition) and antimetastatic 
      (~80% inhibition) activities against cell line and patient-derived TNBC xenograft
      models, with no apparent host toxicity. Collectively, these studies demonstrate
      that targeting Mnk-eIF4E/mTORC1 signaling with a potent Mnk1/2 degrader,
      VNLG-152R, is a novel therapeutic strategy that can be developed as monotherapy
      for the effective treatment of patients with primary/metastatic TNBC.

TI  - Trends in utilization of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) in
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC): a national cancer database (NCDB) analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s10549-019-05150-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to identify trends over time with respect to the use of
      hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) in women with triple negative 
      breast cancer (TNBC) in the national cancer database (NCDB). METHODS: Trends in
      utilization of HF-WBI in women diagnosed with T1-2N0 TNBC in the NCDB between
      2008 and 2013 were analyzed. Case-matched luminal A women were used for
      comparison. Variables included age, race, year of diagnosis, insurance status,
      income quartile, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and institution (academic
      vs. community). Chi square, logistic regression, and multivariate analysis was
      performed. RESULTS: Utilization of HF-WBI among the 53,269 TNBC women identified 
      steadily increased from 4.7% in 2008 to 14.0% in 2013 for women with TNBC
      compared to luminal A cancer whose utilization increased from 7.3 to 23.3% over
      the same time frame (p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, HF-WBI was associated
      with increasing age (p < 0.001), Medicare insurance (p < 0.001), race (p =
      0.041), diagnosis after 2011 (p < 0.001), higher income quartile (p < 0.001), and
      treatment at academic institutions (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, age (p 
      < 0.001, OR 1.038 per year), income quartile (p = 0.002, OR 1.061 per increase in
      quartile), treatment at an academic institution (p < 0.001, OR 1.78)
      significantly increased use of HF-WBI. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment at an academic
      center and year of diagnosis were most correlated with increased HF-WBI in T1-2N0
      TNBC women in the NCDB from 2008 to 2013, followed by increasing age and income. 
      Only 14% of T1-2N0 TNBC women received HF-WBI in 2013. Focus on increased
      utilization is needed for non-academic centers, lower income, and younger women.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Amorphophalli Rhizoma has been widely used as an 
      adjuvant treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer, pancreatic cancer,
      hepatoma, and malignant lymphoma, but its molecular mechanism of action for
      treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is generally poorly 
      understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate genomic changes related to the
      inhibitory effect of Amorphophalli Rhizoma and to elucidate the molecular
      mechanism of this inhibition in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Gene chip analysis was employed to explore genomic changes caused by
      Amorphophalli Rhizoma in TNBC cells. Potential classical signaling pathways,
      upstream regulators, functions, regulatory effects and gene interaction networks 
      were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Real-time quantitative PCR
      (RT-qPCR) and RNA interference (RNAi) assays were used to clarify the roles of
      potential target genes. RESULTS: In total, 536 significantly upregulated and 648 
      significantly downregulated genes were identified between the group treated with 
      Amorphophalli Rhizoma extract and that treated with vehicle. Many of these
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in TNBC cells are involved in DNA
      replication, recombination and repair, the cell cycle, and cellular assembly and 
      organization. Attenuation of KNL1, OLFML2A, RTKN2 and SGO1 gene expression by
      Amorphophalli Rhizoma significantly induced cell cycle arrest and suppressed cell
      proliferation and migration. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibitory effects of Amorphophalli
      Rhizoma in TNBC cells likely occur through regulation of the spindle checkpoint, 
      chromosomal and centrosomal instability, and cell membrane stability.

TI  - Disulfiram and BKM120 in Combination with Chemotherapy Impede Tumor Progression
      and Delay Tumor Recurrence in Tumor Initiating Cell-Rich TNBC.
PG  - 236
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-35619-6 [doi]
AB  - Tumor initiating cells (TIC) have been suggested as a mechanism for driving
      chemoresistance and tumor recurrence in human cancers including triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC). Significant progress has been made in targeting TICs.
      However, methods for simultaneously targeting heterogeneous TIC populations are
      lacking. In this study, we found that treating TNBC cells with chemotherapeutic
      agents led to a significant accumulation of the ALDH(+) TIC population. Treating 
      TNBC cells with a disulfiram and copper mixture (DSF/Cu) specifically decreased
      the ALDH(+) TIC population and treatment with BKM120, a pan-PI3K inhibitor,
      significantly decreased the CD44(+)/CD24(-) TIC population. Furthermore,
      treatment with DSF/Cu or BKM120 induced higher levels of apoptosis in ALDH(+) or 
      CD44(+)/CD24(-) populations, respectively, than in bulk tumor cells. Combining
      DSF/Cu and BKM120 treatment simultaneously decreased the ALDH(+) and
      CD44(+)/CD24(-) TICs. Using a TNBC tumor xenograft mouse model, we found that
      DSF/BKM in combination with Taxol significantly reduced the tumor burden and
      delayed tumor recurrence compared to Taxol treatment alone. Our study is the
      first of its kind to use two different drugs to abolish two major TIC subtypes
      simultaneously and inhibit tumor recurrence. These results lay a foundation for
      developing a novel therapy that can improve chemotherapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Prolactin modulates TNBC aggressive phenotype limiting tumorigenesis.
LID - 10.1530/ERC-18-0523 [doi]
LID - ERC-18-0523.R1 [pii]
AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for ~20% of all breast cancer
      cases. The management of TNBC represents a challenge due to its aggressive
      phenotype, heterogeneity and lack of targeted therapy. Loss of cell
      differentiation and enrichment with breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) are
      features of TNBC contributing to its aggressive nature. Here, we found that PRL
      treatment of TNBC cells to significantly depletes the highly tumorigenic BCSC
      subpopulations CD44+/CD24- and ALDH+ and differentiate them to the least
      tumorigenic CD44-/CD24- and ALDH- phenotype with limited tumorsphere formation
      and self-renewal capacities. Importantly, we found PRL to induce a
      heterochromatin phenotype marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) 
      and accompanied by ultrastructural cellular architecture associated with
      differentiation and senescence rendering the cells refractory to growth signals. 
      Crucially, we found PRL to mediate these effects in vivo in a preclinical animal 
      xenograft of TNBC controlling tumor growth. These results reveal that the
      lactogenic hormone PRL may exert its anti-tumorigenic effects in TNBC through
      cellular reprogramming indicative of differentiation resulting in depletion of
      BCSCs and restricting tumorigenesis.

TI  - Germline TP53 and MSH6 mutations implicated in sporadic triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC): a preliminary study.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/s40246-018-0186-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germline BRCA1/2 prevalence is relatively low in sporadic
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We hypothesized that non-BRCA genes may
      also have significant germline contribution to Chinese sporadic TNBC, and the
      somatic mutational landscape of TNBC may vary between ethnic groups. We therefore
      conducted this study to investigate germline and somatic mutations in 43 cancer
      susceptibility genes in Chinese sporadic TNBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six
      Chinese sporadic TNBC patients were enrolled in this study. Germline and tumor
      DNA of each patient were subjected to capture-based next-generation sequencing
      using a 43-gene panel. Standard bioinformatic analysis and variant classification
      were performed to identify deleterious/likely deleterious germline mutations and 
      somatic mutations. Mutational analysis was conducted to identify significantly
      mutated genes. RESULTS: Deleterious/likely deleterious germline mutations were
      identified in 27 (27/66, 40.9%) patients. Among the 27 patients, 9 (9/66, 13.6%) 
      were TP53 carriers, 5 (5/66, 7.6%) were MSH6 carriers, and 5 (5/66, 7.6%) were
      BRCA1 carriers. Somatic mutations were identified in 64 (64/66, 97.0%) patients. 
      TP53 somatic mutations occurred in most of the patients (45/66, 68.2%) and with
      highest mean allele frequency (28.1%), while NF1 and POLE were detected to have
      the highest mutation counts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results supported our hypotheses
      and suggested great potentials of TP53 and MSH6 as novel candidates for TNBC
      predisposition genes. The high frequency of somatic NF1 and POLE mutations in
      this study showed possibilities for clinical benefits from androgen-blockade
      therapies and immunotherapies in Chinese TNBC patients. Our study indicated
      necessity of multi-gene testing for TNBC prevention and treatment.

TI  - TNBC Challenge: Oligonucleotide Aptamers for New Imaging and Therapy Modalities.
LID - E123 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph11040123 [doi]
AB  - Compared to other breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) usually
      affects younger patients, is larger in size, of higher grade and is biologically 
      more aggressive. To date, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the only
      available treatment for TNBC because it lacks expression of the estrogen receptor
      (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
      and no alternative targetable molecules have been identified so far. The high
      biological and clinical heterogeneity adds a further challenge to TNBC management
      and requires the identification of new biomarkers to improve detection by
      imaging, thus allowing the specific treatment of each individual TNBC subtype.
      The Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) technique
      holds great promise to the search for novel targetable biomarkers, and
      aptamer-based molecular approaches have the potential to overcome obstacles of
      current imaging and therapy modalities. In this review, we highlight recent
      advances in oligonucleotide aptamers used as imaging and/or therapeutic agents in
      TNBC, discussing the potential options to discover, image and hit new actionable 
      targets in TNBC.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by lack of estrogen
      receptors, progesterone hormone receptors, and HER2 overexpression, is a more
      aggressive high grade tumor and not sensitive to current targeted drugs. The
      clinical prognosis of TNBC is poorer than other types of breast cancer, and there
      is no effective therapy strategy until now. Thus, it is necessary to determine
      important factors involved in regulating the progression of TNBC. In this study, 
      we found DEPDC1 was up-regulated in the tissues of TNBC compared with their
      paired peritumoral tissues. DEPDC1 over-expression facilitated cell proliferation
      and tumor growth through increasing the expression of FOXM1 in TNBC cells.
      Conversely, knockdown of DEPDC1 had the opposite effects. Moreover, miR-26b,
      acting as a tumor suppressor in TNBC, directly repressed the expression of DEPDC1
      and mitigated its promotive effects on cell growth and colony formation. These
      results indicate that DEPDC1, negatively regulated by miR-26b, promotes cell
      proliferation and tumor growth via up-regulating FOXM1 expression, implying an
      important underlying mechanism of regulating the progression of TNBC.

TI  - Targeting Thioredoxin System with an Organosulfur Compound, Diallyl Trisulfide
      (DATS), Attenuates Progression and Metastasis of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
      (TNBC).
PG  - 1945-1963
LID - 10.1159/000494874 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Metastasis is the leading cause resulting in high mortality in
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Cancer cells are skilled at
      utilizing thioredoxin (Trx) system as an efficient antioxidant system to
      counteract oxidative damage, facilitating the occurrence of metastasis. Here, we 
      identified an organosulfur compound named DATS isolated from garlic, that
      inhibits the expression of Trx-1 and the enzyme activity of Trx reductase in
      breast cancer cells. METHODS: Tissue microarray of breast cancer patients and
      immunohistochemical method were used to analyze the role of Trx-1 in breast
      cancer metastasis. Spotaneous metastasis model and experimental metastasis model 
      combined with HE staining, immunohistochemistry were used to verify in vivo
      anti-metastatic effect of DATS as well as its regulation on thioredoxin. Western 
      blot, immunofluorescence, redox state assessment and detection of enzyme activity
      were employed to determine the effect of DATS on thioredoxin system. Trx-1 siRNA 
      interference was used to investigate the conclusive evidence that Trx-1 was the
      target of DATS. RESULTS: In agreement with reduced Trx-1 nuclear translocation
      from cytoplasm by DATS, the production of reduced form of Trx-1 was dramatically 
      decreased. Furthermore, in vivo, DATS administration was observed to
      significantly suppress spontaneous and experimental metastasis in nude mice.
      Delivery of DATS also resulted in decreased expression of Trx-1 as the direct
      target, as well as expression of NF-kappaB and MMP2/9 in primary tumor and lung
      tissue. Notably, the effects of DATS on the expression of downstream
      metastasis-associated genes were mediated by Trx-1, as demonstrated by the
      combination use of DATS and Trx-1 siRNA. CONCLUSION: Collectively, this present
      study indicates that targeting Trx system with DATS may provide a promising
      strategy for treating metastasis of TNBC.

AB  - Collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) expression and collagen hydroxylation in
      cancer cells are necessary for breast cancer progression. Here, we show that P4H 
      alpha 1 subunit (P4HA1) protein expression is induced in triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) and HER2 positive breast cancer. By modulating alpha ketoglutarate 
      (alpha-KG) and succinate levels P4HA1 expression reduces proline hydroxylation on
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha, enhancing its stability in cancer cells.
      Activation of the P4HA/HIF-1 axis enhances cancer cell stemness, accompanied by
      decreased oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.
      Inhibition of P4HA1 sensitizes TNBC to the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel and
      doxorubicin in xenografts and patient-derived models. We also show that increased
      P4HA1 expression correlates with short relapse-free survival in TNBC patients who
      received chemotherapy. These results suggest that P4HA1 promotes chemoresistance 
      by modulating HIF-1-dependent cancer cell stemness. Targeting collagen P4H is a
      promising strategy to inhibit tumor progression and sensitize TNBC to
      chemotherapeutic agents.

      survivin-mediated survival of TNBC cells.
PG  - 1050

AB  - Mitochondrial morphology is remodeled by continuous dynamic cycles of fission and
      fusion. Emerging data have shown that the disturbance of balance between
      mitochondrial fission and fusion is involved in the progression of several types 
      of neoplasms. However, the status of mitochondrial dynamics and its potential
      biological roles in breast cancer (BC), particularly in triple negative BC (TNBC)
      are not fully clear. Here, we reported that the mitochondrial fission was
      significantly increased in BC tissues, especially in the TNBC tissues, when
      compared with that in the corresponding peritumor tissues. Meanwhile, our data
      showed that Drp1 was upregulated, while Mfn1 was downregulated in TNBC. Moreover,
      elevated mitochondrial fission was associated with poorer prognosis in TNBC
      patients. Mitochondrial fission promoted the survival of TNBC cells both in vitro
      and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified a positive feedback loop between
      mitochondrial fission and Notch signaling pathway in TNBC cells, as proved by the
      experimental evidence that the activation of Notch signaling enhanced
      Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission and Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in
      turn promoted the activation of Notch signaling, which ultimately promoted the
      cell survival of TNBC via increasing survivin expression level. Inhibition of
      either Notch1 or Drp1 significantly impaired the activation of the other, leading
      to the suppression of TNBC cell survival and proliferation. Collectively, our
      data reveal a novel mechanism that the positive feedback loop between
      mitochondrial fission and Notch signaling promotes the survival, proliferation
      and apoptotic resistance of TNBC cells via increasing survivin expression and
      thus favors cancer progression.

TI  - Bcl-3 promotes proliferation and chemosensitivity in BL1 subtype of TNBC cells.
PG  - 1141-1149
LID - 10.1093/abbs/gmy117 [doi]
AB  - Bcl-3 is an established oncogene in diverse malignant tumors. In this study, we
      investigated a dual role of Bcl-3 in BL1-subtype triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC). The BL1-subtype TNBC is featured by increasing cell cycle gene expression
      and the highest sensitivity to chemotherapy among all subtypes. Bcl-3 is
      associated with a better prognosis in BL1 patients. Bcl-3 knockdown in BL1 cell
      MDA-MB-468 induces the inhibition of cell proliferation and the G1/S transition
      arrest by promoting p27 and reducing the expressions of c-Myc and skp2 at mRNA
      and protein levels. Meanwhile, Bcl-3 enhances the sensitivity of MDA-MB-468 to
      chemotherapeutics ABX and PTX. Furthermore, the regulation mechanisms are
      restricted to BL1 cell and do not occur in SUM159PT, a typical MSL subtype of
      TNBC cell. These data suggest that Bcl-3 may be a potential clinical biomarker
      for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with BL1-subtype TNBC.

TI  - PYK2 negatively regulates the Hippo pathway in TNBC by stabilizing TAZ protein.
PG  - 985
LID - 10.1038/s41419-018-1005-z [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor Hippo pathway negatively regulates the transcriptional
      coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with
      PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) to inhibit cell growth and control organ size, whereas
      activation of YAP and TAZ is implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis.
      Here, we report that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 positively regulates
      TAZ and YAP transcriptional activity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We 
      found that inhibition of PYK2 expression or its kinase activity substantially
      affects the steady-state level of TAZ and markedly facilitates its proteasomal
      degradation. This effect was specific to PYK2 inhibition and was not obtained by 
      inhibition of FAK. Destabilization of TAZ was associated with profound effect of 
      PYK2 inhibition on cell growth at low-density concomitant with reduced expression
      of TAZ-target genes and induction of cell apoptosis. We further show that PYK2
      enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of both TAZ and LATS1/2 and concomitantly
      TAZ stability, and that PYK2 protein level correlates with the level of TAZ
      protein in primary breast tumors. Together these observations suggest that PYK2
      is an important regulator of the Hippo pathway, and its tyrosine kinase activity 
      has a striking effect on TAZ stabilization and activation in TNBC.

TI  - ST8SIA1 Regulates Tumor Growth and Metastasis in TNBC by Activating the
      FAK-AKT-mTOR Signaling Pathway.

AB  - Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) are implicated in cancer recurrence and
      metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We have recently discovered
      that ganglioside GD2 expression defines BCSCs and that ST8SIA1 regulates GD2
      expression and BCSC function. In this report, we show that ST8SIA1 is highly
      expressed in primary TNBC; its expression is positively correlated with the
      expression of several BCSC-associated genes such as BCL11A, FOXC1, CXCR4,
      PDGFRbeta, SOX2, and mutations in p53. CRISPR knockout of ST8SIA1 completely
      inhibited BCSC functions, including in vitro tumorigenesis and mammosphere
      formation. Mechanistic studies discovered activation of the FAK-AKT-mTOR
      signaling pathway in GD2(+) BCSCs, and its tight regulation by ST8SIA1. Finally, 
      knockout of ST8SIA1 completely blocked in vivo tumor growth and metastasis by
      TNBC cells. In summary, these data demonstrate the mechanism by which ST8SIA1
      regulates tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC and identifies it as a novel
      therapeutic target.

      single-cell RNA-seq.
PG  - 3588
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-06052-0 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype characterized by
      extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. To investigate the underlying biology, we
      conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of >1500 cells from six primary 
      TNBC. Here, we show that intercellular heterogeneity of gene expression programs 
      within each tumor is variable and largely correlates with clonality of inferred
      genomic copy number changes, suggesting that genotype drives the gene expression 
      phenotype of individual subpopulations. Clustering of gene expression profiles
      identified distinct subgroups of malignant cells shared by multiple tumors,
      including a single subpopulation associated with multiple signatures of treatment
      resistance and metastasis, and characterized functionally by activation of
      glycosphingolipid metabolism and associated innate immunity pathways. A novel
      signature defining this subpopulation predicts long-term outcomes for TNBC
      patients in a large cohort. Collectively, this analysis reveals the functional
      heterogeneity and its association with genomic evolution in TNBC, and uncovers
      unanticipated biological principles dictating poor outcomes in this disease.

TI  - Genomic Alterations Associated with Recurrence and TNBC Subtype in High-Risk
      Early Breast Cancers.
PG  - 97-108
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0619 [doi]
AB  - The identification of early breast cancer patients who may benefit from adjuvant 
      chemotherapy has evolved to include assessment of clinicopathologic features such
      as tumor size and nodal status, as well as several gene-expression profiles for
      ER-positive, HER2-negative cancers. However, these tools do not reliably identify
      patients at the greatest risk of recurrence. The mutation and copy-number
      landscape of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes defined by gene
      expression is also largely unknown, and elucidation of this landscape may shed
      light on novel therapeutic opportunities. The USO01062 phase III clinical trial
      of standard chemotherapy (with or without capecitabine) enrolled a cohort of
      putatively high-risk patients based on clinical features, yet only observed a
      5-year disease-free survival event rate of 11.6%. In order to uncover genomic
      aberrations associated with recurrence, a targeted next-generation sequencing
      panel was used to compare tumor specimens from patients who had a recurrence
      event with a matched set who did not. The somatic mutation and copy-number
      alteration landscapes of high-risk early breast cancer patients were
      characterized and alterations associated with relapse were identified. Tumor
      mutational burden was evaluated but was not prognostic in this study, nor did it 
      correlate with PDL1 or CD8 gene expression. However, TNBC subtypes had
      substantial genomic heterogeneity with a distinct pattern of genomic alterations 
      and putative underlying driver mutations. IMPLICATIONS: The present study
      uncovers a compendium of genomic alterations with utility to more precisely
      identify high-risk patients for adjuvant trials of novel therapeutic agents.

AB  - Whole exome sequencing in triple negative breast cancer cases (n = 8) and
      targeted sequencing in healthy controls (n = 48) revealed BRIP1 rs552752779 (MAF:

      CI 12.29-2985.48) as risk factors for triple negative breast cancer. Construction
      of classification and regression tree followed by smart pruning identified MSH6
      and BRIP1 variants as the major determinants of TNBC (Triple Negative Breast
      Cancer) risk. Except for ERBB2, all other genes regulate DNA repair and
      chromosomal integrity. In TNBC cases, two likely pathogenic variations i.e. NCOR1
      rs562300336 and PIM1 rs746748226 were observed at frequencies of 18.75% and
      12.5%, respectively. Among the 24 variants of unknown significance, MMP9
      rs199676062, SYNE1 rs368709678, AURKA rs373550419, ABCC4 rs11568694 have variant 
      allele frequency >/= 62.5%. These genes regulate metastasis, nuclear modeling,
      cell cycle and cellular detoxification, respectively. To conclude, aberrations in
      DNA mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair or BRCA1 associated genome
      surveillance mechanism contribute towards triple negative breast cancer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the importance of chemotherapy in the treatment of early
      stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), no one optimal regimen has been
      identified. We conducted a pilot trial comparing outcomes for the three most
      commonly used chemotherapy regimens to assess the feasibility of conducting a
      larger definitive trial. METHODS: Using integrated consent, newly diagnosed TNBC 
      patients were randomised to one of three standard regimens: dose-dense
      doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide then paclitaxel, doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide then
      weekly paclitaxel or 5-FU-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide then docetaxel. Feasibility
      endpoints included; physician engagement, accrual rates, physician compliance and
      patient satisfaction with the integrated consent model. Our anticipated pilot
      trial sample size was 35 randomised patients in one year. RESULTS: Between August
      30th, 2016 and January 31st 2017, 2 patients met eligibility and were randomised.
      A survey of 10 participating oncologists was performed to identify potential
      strategies to enhance accrual. Most investigators (9/10) believed that the best
      regimen for TNBC was unknown, and 4/10 felt this was a pressing clinical
      question. Physicians' responses suggested that poor accrual was due to: a lack of
      interest in some study arms as oncologists already had a preferred regimen (4/10)
      and concerns about trial demands in busy clinics (3/10). The pilot feasibility
      endpoints were not met and the study was closed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial
      interest in the trial question and multiple investigators agreeing to approach
      patients, this trial failed to meet feasibility endpoints. The reasons for poor
      accrual were multiple and require further evaluation if this important
      patient-centred question is to be answered. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02688803.

TI  - Spatially constrained tandem bromodomain inhibition bolsters sustained repression
      of BRD4 transcriptional activity for TNBC cell growth.
PG  - 7949-7954
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1720000115 [doi]
AB  - The importance of BET protein BRD4 in gene transcription is well recognized
      through the study of chemical modulation of its characteristic tandem bromodomain
      (BrD) binding to lysine-acetylated histones and transcription factors. However,
      while monovalent inhibition of BRD4 by BET BrD inhibitors such as JQ1 blocks
      growth of hematopoietic cancers, it is much less effective generally in solid
      tumors. Here, we report a thienodiazepine-based bivalent BrD inhibitor, MS645,
      that affords spatially constrained tandem BrD inhibition and consequently
      sustained repression of BRD4 transcriptional activity in blocking proliferation
      of solid-tumor cells including a panel of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      cells. MS645 blocks BRD4 binding to transcription enhancer/mediator proteins MED1
      and YY1 with potency superior to monovalent BET inhibitors, resulting in
      down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and genes for cell-cycle control and
      DNA damage repair that are largely unaffected by monovalent BrD inhibition. Our
      study suggests a therapeutic strategy to maximally control BRD4 activity for
      rapid growth of solid-tumor TNBC cells.

TI  - Taxol Induces Brk-dependent Prosurvival Phenotypes in TNBC Cells through an
      AhR/GR/HIF-driven Signaling Axis.
PG  - 1761-1772
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0410 [doi]
AB  - The metastatic cascade is a complex process that requires cancer cells to survive
      despite conditions of high physiologic stress. Previously, cooperation between
      the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) was reported
      as a point of convergence for host and cellular stress signaling. These studies
      indicated p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of GR on Ser134 and subsequent
      p-GR/HIF-dependent induction of breast tumor kinase (PTK6/Brk), as a mediator of 
      aggressive cancer phenotypes. Herein, p-Ser134 GR was quantified in human primary
      breast tumors (n = 281) and the levels of p-GR were increased in triple-negative 
      breast cancer (TNBC) relative to luminal breast cancer. Brk was robustly induced 
      following exposure of TNBC model systems to chemotherapeutic agents (Taxol or
      5-fluorouracil) and growth in suspension [ultra-low attachment (ULA)]. Notably,
      both Taxol and ULA resulted in upregulation of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor
      (AhR), a known mediator of cancer prosurvival phenotypes. Mechanistically, AhR
      and GR copurified and following chemotherapy and ULA, these factors assembled at 
      the Brk promoter and induced Brk expression in an HIF-dependent manner.
      Furthermore, Brk expression was upregulated in Taxol-resistant breast cancer
      (MCF-7) models. Ultimately, Brk was critical for TNBC cell proliferation and
      survival during Taxol treatment and in the context of ULA as well as for basal
      cancer cell migration, acquired biological phenotypes that enable cancer cells to
      successfully complete the metastatic cascade. These studies nominate AhR as a
      p-GR binding partner and reveal ways to target epigenetic events such as adaptive
      and stress-induced acquisition of cancer skill sets required for metastatic
      cancer spread.Implication: Breast cancer cells enlist intracellular stress
      response pathways that evade chemotherapy by increasing cancer cell survival and 
      promoting migratory phenotypes. Mol Cancer Res; 16(11); 1761-72. (c)2018 AACR.

TI  - Overexpression of miR-361-5p in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) inhibits
      migration and invasion by targeting RQCD1 and inhibiting the EGFR/PI3K/Akt
      pathway.
PG  - 52-59
LID - 10.17305/bjbms.2018.3399 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death
      in women. Previous studies indicated that miR-361-5p was downregulated in breast 
      cancer, however, the exact effect of miR-361-5p on TNBC requires further
      investigation. In the present study, we investigated whether miR-361-5p can act
      as a tumor suppressor by targeting required for cell differentiation 1 homolog
      (RQCD1) and inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in TNBC. The expression of
      miR-361-5p and RQCD1 was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR
      (qRT-PCR) and/or western blot in TNBC and the adjacent tissues. miR-361-5p mimics
      were constructed and transfected to TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Cells were divided
      into three groups: blank control group, miRNA mimic negative control (NC) group, 
      and miR-361-5p mimics group. Expression of miR-361-5p, mRNA and protein
      expression of PI3K, Akt, EGFR, phosphorylated (p)-EGFR/PI3K/Akt, and protein
      expression of RQCD1 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) in MDA-MB-231 were
      measured by qRT-PCR/western blot after transfection. Cell viability was
      determined by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration and invasion ability were evaluated by 
      scratch and transwell assay, respectively. miR-361-5p target gene was determined 
      by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. RQCD1 was identified as
      a target of miR-361-5p by TargetScan and confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. 
      Downregulated miR-361-5p and upregulated RQCD1 were observed in TNBC tissues.
      Expression of EGFR, PI3K, Akt and MMP-9 was inhibited in cells treated with
      miR-361-5p mimics. Transfection of miR-361-5p mimics also inhibited the
      phosphorylation of EGFR, PI3K, and Akt. Suppressed cell viability, migration, and
      invasion was found in miR-361-5p mimics groups. Our results indicated that
      overexpression of miR-361-5p might act as a suppressor in TNBC by targeting RQCD1
      to inhibit the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

TI  - Salidroside inhibits migration, invasion and angiogenesis of MDAMB 231 TNBC cells
      by regulating EGFR/Jak2/STAT3 signaling via MMP2.
PG  - 877-885
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2018.4430 [doi]
AB  - The major hallmarks of tumor progression are angiogenesis, migration and
      metastasis. Among the components of Rhodiola rosea, salidroside
      (phydroxyphenethyl-betad-glucoside) is one of the most potent, and is present in 
      all Rhodiola species. Recent data have revealed the anticancer effects of
      salidroside; however, the mechanism underlying its ability to inhibit tumor
      angiogenesis remains unknown. The present study aimed to analyze how salidroside 
      affects major factors involved in breast cancer, and to elucidate its ability to 
      inhibit angiogenesis and invasion. Signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) is a marker for tumor angiogenesis and migration, which
      interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Specifically, MMPs act as a
      downstream target for STAT3. Using western blotting and reverse
      transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, the present study 
      demonstrated that treatment of MDAMB 231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      cells with salidroside led to inhibition of invasion and migration markers, and
      of STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, in vitro angiogenesis analyses in human
      umbilical vein endothelial cells confirmed the anti-angiogenic activity of
      salidroside. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay also demonstrated that
      salidroside may inhibit the DNA-binding activity of STAT3, preventing STAT3 from 
      binding to a novel binding site of the MMP2 gene promoter. In conclusion, the
      present results demonstrated that salidroside may downregulate the STAT3
      signaling pathway, and inhibit cell viability, migration and invasion through
      MMPs in breast cancer cells.

      drug-resistance through regulating stemness, EMT and apoptosis.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast
      cancer in which the cell surface lacks usual targets for drug to exhibit its
      effects. Epirubicin (Epi) is widely used for TNBC, but a substantial number of
      patients develop Epi resistance that is usually associated with poor prognosis.
      Transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine. In recent
      study, it appears that TGF-beta influences the cancer stem cell population, thus,
      the drug resistance of cancer may also be affected. We used epirubicin to treat
      MDA-MB-231 (MB-231) cells and found that TGF-beta and breast cancer stem cell
      markers CD44(+)CD24(-) were increased and were dose-dependent of epirubicin. We
      established drug-resistant cell line from parental MB-231cells by chronic
      treatment with low-concentration epirubicin. The MB-231/Epi cell line showed
      relatively slow growth rate with varied morphology. Transwell assay and drug
      sensitivity assay revealed that the malignant cell behaviors in terms of
      migration, invasion and epirubicin-resistant properties were markedly increased
      in the MB-231/Epi cells. Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, and flow
      cytometry were used to analyze the expression levels of the breast cancer stem
      cell markers, CD44 and CD24. Mammospheres assay showed that the stemness of
      MB-231/Epi was increased compared to their parental cells. Interestingly,
      MB-231/Epi cells showed different expression levels of apoptosis-related markers:
      Bcl2, Bax; EMT-related markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin and cell cycle-related
      marker cyclinD1. These genes have all been shown to be regulated by the TGF-beta 
      pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that TGF-beta plays a vital role in
      TNBC epirubicin-resistance through regulating stemness, EMT and apoptosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression and function of insulin-like growth factor
      II (IGFII) mRNA binding protein (IMP3) in the Triple Negative Breast Cancer
      (TNBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to previously reported gene expression
      array, we found that IMP3 had significantly higher expression in the
      CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster, tumor initiating cell or cancer stem cell (CSCs),
      compared to other tumor cells. Based on the GEO database (GEO accession No.
      GSE6883), we detected the mRNA levels of IMP 1,2 and 3 by quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction (q-PCR) in CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster and other breast tumor cell
      clusters. Besides, we measured IMP3 expression in microsphere of breast cancer,
      which exerted more significant tumor stem cell properties. The effects of IMP3 on
      breast cancer cell stem cell properties were studied by RNA interference and
      overexpression approaches in vitro. Furthermore, we predicted and identified
      microRNA, which could target and regulate IMP3 from bioinformatics analysis, and 
      verified the interaction by luciferase assays and rescue experiments. RESULTS:
      Previously reported data showed that IMP3 expression was significantly
      upregulated in CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster from breast cancer tissues. Besides,
      we found IMP3 had higher expression in mesenchymal cells rather than epithelial
      cells, which was also significantly elevated in SUM159 and T49D cell lines
      cultured as microsphere rather than adherent cells or differentiated cells.
      CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster proportion was significantly decreased after
      silencing IMP3 in SUM1315, and its ability to develop into microsphere was
      significantly inhibited. By re-expressing IMP3 in SUM315, we restored the
      self-renewal capacity and tumorigenesis potential of SUM315. Through relative
      predicting website, we found several miRNAs which could regulate IMP3. miR-34a
      with highest score was chosen for further analysis. Mimicking miR-34a
      significantly downregulated IMP3 expression and inhibited its ability to develop 
      into microsphere, while overexpressing IMP3 could rescue this process.
      CONCLUSIONS: IMP3 plays a vital role in maintaining stem cell properties of
      breast cancer cells, which could be regulated by mir-34a.

TI  - How shall we treat early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC): from the current
      standard to upcoming immuno-molecular strategies.
PG  - e000357
LID - 10.1136/esmoopen-2018-000357 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a long-lasting orphan disease in terms of
      little therapeutic progress during the past several decades and still the
      standard of care remains chemotherapy. Experimental discovery of molecular
      signatures including the 'BRCAness' highlighted the innate heterogeneity of TNBC,
      generating the diversity of TNBC phenotypes. As it contributes to enhancing
      genomic instability, it has widened the therapeutic spectrum of TNBC. In
      particular, unusual sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was denoted in patients
      with BRCA deficiency, suggesting therapeutic benefit from platinum and
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, regardless of enriched
      chemosensitivity and immunogenicity, majority of patients with TNBC still suffer 
      from dismal clinical outcomes including early relapse and metastatic spread.
      Therefore, efforts into more precise and personalised treatment are critical at
      this point. Accordingly, the advance of multiomics has revealed novel actionable 
      targets including PI3K-Akt-mTOR and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling
      pathways, which might actively participate in modulating the chemosensitivity and
      immune system. Also, TNBC has long been considered a potential protagonist of
      immunotherapy in breast cancer, supported by abundant tumour-infiltrating
      lymphocytes and heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Despite that, earlier
      studies showed somewhat unsatisfactory results of monotherapy with
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors, consistently durable responses in responders were
      noteworthy. Based on these results, further combinatorial trials either with
      other chemotherapy or targeted agents are underway. Incorporating
      immune-molecular targets into combination as well as refining the standard
      chemotherapy might be the key to unlock the future of TNBC. In this review, we
      share the current and upcoming treatment options of TNBC in the framework of
      scientific and clinical data, especially focusing on early stage of TNBC.

AB  - Nowadays, risk factors of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis are not
      well identified. Our present study reveals that an industrial chemical, bisphenol
      S (BPS), can promote the migration, but not the proliferation, of TNBC cells in
      vitro. BPS activates YAP, a key effector of Hippo pathway, by inhibiting its
      phosphorylation, which promotes YAP nuclear accumulation and up-regulates its
      downstream genes such as CTGF and ANKRD1. Inhibition of YAP blocks the
      BPS-triggered cell migration and up-regulation of fibronectin (FN) and vimentin
      (Vim). BPS rapidly decreases the phosphorylation levels of LATS1 (Ser909) in TNBC
      cells, which regulates the activation and functions of YAP. Silencing LATS1/2 by 
      siRNA increases BPS-induced dephosphorylation of YAP and extended the half-life
      of YAP protein. Inhibition of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) and
      its downstream PLCbeta/PKC signals attenuate the effects of BPS-induced YAP
      dephosphorylation and CTGF up-regulation. Targeted inhibition of GPER/YAP
      inhibits BPS-induced migration of TNBC cells. Collectively, we reveal that
      GPER/Hippo-YAP signal is involved in BPS-induced migration of TNBC cells.

TI  - The ERbeta4 variant induces transformation of the normal breast mammary

      aggressiveness of TNBC by regulation of hypoxic signaling.
PG  - 12201-12211
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.24134 [doi]
AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) still remains a challenge to treat in the
      clinic due to a lack of good targets for treatment. Although TNBC lacks
      expression of ERalpha, the expression of ERbeta and its variants are detected
      quite frequently in this cancer type and can represent an avenue for treatment.
      We show that two of the variants of ERbeta, namely ERbeta2 and ERbeta5, control
      aggressiveness of TNBC by regulating hypoxic signaling through stabilization of
      HIF-1alpha. RNA-seq of patient derived xenografts (PDX) from TNBC shows
      expression of ERbeta2, ERbeta4 and ERbeta5 variants in more than half of the
      samples. Furthermore, expression of ERbeta4 in the immortalized, normal mammary
      epithelial cell line MCF-10A that is resistant to tumorsphere formation caused
      transformation and development of tumorspheres. By contrast, ERbeta1, ERbeta2 or 
      ERbeta5 were unable to support tumorsphere formation. We have previously shown
      that all variants except ERbeta1 stabilize HIF-1alpha but only ERbeta4 appears to
      have the ability to transform normal mammary epithelial cells, pointing towards a
      unique property of ERbeta4. We propose that ERbeta variants may be good
      diagnostic tools and also serve as novel targets for treatment of breast cancer.

TI  - Discovery of N-(Naphtho[1,2-b]Furan-5-Yl) Benzenesulfonamides as Novel Selective 
      Inhibitors of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).
LID - E678 [pii]

AB  - Any type of breast cancer not expressing genes of the estrogen receptor (ER),
      progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is
      referred to as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Accordingly, TNBCs do not
      respond to hormonal therapies or medicines targeting the ER, PR, or HER2.
      Systemic chemotherapy is therefore the only treatment option available today and 
      prognoses remain poor. We report the discovery and characterization of
      N-(naphtho[1,2-b]furan-5-yl)benzenesulfonamides as selective inhibitors of TNBCs.
      These inhibitors were identified by virtual screening and inhibited different
      TNBC cell lines with IC50 values of 2-3 muM. The compounds did not inhibit normal
      (i.e. MCF-7 and MCF-10A) cells in vitro, indicating their selectivity against
      TNBC cells. Considering the selectivity of these inhibitors for TNBC, these
      compounds and analogs can serve as a promising starting point for further
      research on effective TNBC inhibitors.

TI  - Leptin Signaling Mediates Obesity-Associated CSC Enrichment and EMT in
      Preclinical TNBC Models.
PG  - 869-879
LID - 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-17-0508 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is associated with poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC). Preclinical models of TNBC were used to test the hypothesis that
      increased leptin signaling drives obesity-associated TNBC development by
      promoting cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT). MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice, which develop spontaneous
      basal-like, triple-negative mammary tumors, received either a control diet (10%
      kcal from fat) or a diet-induced obesity regimen (DIO, 60% kcal from fat) for up 
      to 42 weeks (n = 15/group). Mice were monitored for tumor development and
      euthanized when tumor diameter reached 1.5 cm. Tumoral gene expression was
      assessed via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). DIO mice had greater body weight and
      percent body fat at termination than controls. DIO mice, versus controls,
      demonstrated reduced survival, increased systemic metabolic and inflammatory
      perturbations, upregulated tumoral CSC/EMT gene signature, elevated tumoral
      aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (a CSC marker), and greater leptin signaling. In 
      cell culture experiments using TNBC cells (murine: E-Wnt and M-Wnt; human:
      MDA-MB-231), leptin enhanced mammosphere formation, and media supplemented with
      serum from DIO versus control mice increased cell viability, migration, invasion,
      and CSC- and EMT-related gene expression, including Foxc2, Twist2, Vim, Akt3, and
      Sox2 In E-Wnt cells, knockdown of leptin receptor ablated these procancer effects
      induced by DIO mouse serum. These findings indicate that increased leptin
      signaling is causally linked to obesity-associated TNBC development by promoting 
      CSC enrichment and EMT.Implications: Leptin-associated signals impacting CSC and 
      EMT may provide new targets and intervention strategies for decreasing TNBC
      burden in obese women. Mol Cancer Res; 16(5); 869-79. (c)2018 AACR.

AB  - Advances in cancer immunotherapy and a growing body of research have focused on
      the role of the antitumor response in breast cancer. Triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) is the most immunogenic breast cancer subtype, and there is strong 
      evidence that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in TNBC have prognostic value and
      are associated with clinical outcome and improved survival. Evading antitumor
      immunity is a hallmark for the development and progression of cancer.
      Immunotherapy studies have focused on the role of the programmed cell death-1
      (PD-1) receptor/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway in maintaining
      immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis 
      has emerged as a promising therapeutic option to enhance antitumor immunity and
      is actively being investigated in TNBC, with encouraging results. In this
      article, the authors review the current literature on checkpoint inhibitors in
      TNBC with a focus on PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and discuss combination strategies and
      novel approaches for improving antitumor immunity and clinical outcome. Cancer

TI  - PD-L1 Expression in TNBC: A Predictive Biomarker of Response to Neoadjuvant
      Chemotherapy?
PG  - 1750925
LID - 10.1155/2017/1750925 [doi]
AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an aggressive clinical behaviour, with a
      poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Recently, tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs) have been proposed as a predictive biomarker for a better
      clinical outcome and pathological response (pR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (NACT) in TNBC. These data confirm the role of the immune system in the
      neoplastic progression and in the response to therapy. We performed a
      retrospective analysis of 54 pre-NACT biopsies of TNBC and compared both the
      percentage of stromal TILs and the degree of PD-L1 expression with the extent of 
      pR to standard NACT. A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 35%
      of cases. Univariate analysis showed (i) a significant association between PD-L1 
      expression in >/=25% of neoplastic cells and the achievement of a pCR (p =
      0.024); (ii) a significantly higher frequency of pCR in cases showing >/=50%
      stromal TILs (p < 0.001). However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1
      expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 
      95% CI 1,01-1,27), suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be
      associated with a subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy.
      These data need to be confirmed by larger studies.

AB  - The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept is currently employed to explain the mechanism
      of multidrug resistance that is implicated in the reduced efficacy of many
      chemotherapeutic agents, consequently leading to metastatic spread and disease
      relapse. We searched for potential predictive markers of doxorubicin (DOX)
      resistance in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) of the BT-549 human
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line classified as a claudin-low
      subtype. In this study, we show that BT-549 presents a BCSCs-like subset
      determined by a CD44(+/high)/CD24(-/low)/ALDH1(+) phenotype. The
      CD44(+/high)/CD24(-/low)/ALDH(+) BCSCs-like subset presented the downregulation
      of a majority of the genes analyzed (64 genes), and only 3 genes were upregulated
      after DOX treatment. Among the upregulated genes, MAPK3, PRKCZ and STAT3, STAT3
      presented a higher level of upregulation in the DOX-treated
      CD44(+/high)/CD24(-/low)/ALDH(+) BCSCs-like subset. The identification of
      biomarkers that predict antitumor responses is at the top of cancer research
      priorities. STAT3 was highlighted as a molecular signature in the
      CD44(+/high)/CD24(-/low)/ALDH1(+) BCSCs-like subset obtained from the TNBC BT-549
      cell line related to DOX resistance. A majority of the evaluated genes in the EGF
      pathway appear to be not associated with DOX resistance, as observed in the
      CD44(+/high)/CD24(-/low)/ALDH1(+) BCSCs-like subset.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogenous disease with high
      aggressive and poor outcome. The lack of biomarkers and targeted therapies makes 
      it a challenge for the treatment of TNBC. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis)
      are emerging as novel anti-tumor agents in many types of human cancers. In this
      study, we found that I-7ab, a novel HDACi, inhibited the cell viability of TNBC
      cells and induced the cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, I-7ab specifically
      decreased the expression of HDAC3 and promoted the acetylation of p53 at both
      Lys373 and Lys382 amino acids. The up-regulated acetylation of p53 promoted the
      transcriptional activity of p53 and induced the expression of p21, which
      consequently caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Administration of I-7ab
      inhibited the colony formation of TNBC cells. Collectively, these results
      indicated I-7ab as a promising anti-cancer agent in the treatment of TNBC.

TI  - The exploration of contrasting pathways in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s12885-017-3939-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) lack the appropriate targets
      for currently used breast cancer therapies, conferring an aggressive phenotype,
      more frequent relapse and poorer survival rates. The biological heterogeneity of 
      TNBC complicates the clinical treatment further. We have explored and compared
      the biological pathways in TNBC and other subtypes of breast cancers, using an in
      silico approach and the hypothesis that two opposing effects (Yin and Yang)
      pathways in cancer cells determine the fate of cancer cells. Identifying breast
      subgroup specific components of these opposing pathways may aid in selecting
      potential therapeutic targets as well as further classifying the heterogeneous
      TNBC subtype. METHODS: Gene expression and patient clinical data from The Cancer 
      Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International
      Consortium (METABRIC) were used for this study. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
      (GSEA) was used to identify the more active pathways in cancer (Yin) than in
      normal and the more active pathways in normal (Yang) than in cancer. The
      clustering analysis was performed to compare pathways of TNBC with other types of
      breast cancers. The association of pathway classified TNBC sub-groups to clinical
      outcomes was tested using Cox regression model. RESULTS: Among 4729 curated
      canonical pathways in GSEA database, 133 Yin pathways (FDR < 0.05) and 71 Yang
      pathways (p-value <0.05) were discovered in TNBC. The FOXM1 is the top Yin
      pathway while PPARalpha is the top Yang pathway in TNBC. The TNBC and other types
      of breast cancers showed different pathways enrichment significance profiles.
      Using top Yin and Yang pathways as classifier, the TNBC can be further subtyped
      into six sub-groups each having different clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: We first
      reported that the FOMX1 pathway is the most upregulated and the PPARalpha pathway
      is the most downregulated pathway in TNBC. These two pathways could be
      simultaneously targeted in further studies. Also the pathway classifier we
      performed in this study provided insight into the TNBC heterogeneity.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) RMST in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC):
      Expression analysis and biological roles research.
PG  - 6603-6612
LID - 10.1002/jcp.26311 [doi]
AB  - Microarray showed that lncRNA RMST was differentially expressed in cervical
      cancer. Further experiments were conducted to detect the expression and
      biological function of RMST in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Microarray
      was used to screen the differentially expressed lncRNAs in TNBC. QRT-PCR was
      applied to uncover the expression of RMST in TNBC tissues. The cell viability of 
      RMST-transfected TNBC cells were probed by CKK-8 assay and colony formation
      assay. TUNEL assay was conducted to test the cell apoptosis and FCM assay was
      exerted to detect the cell cycle. The invasion and migration ability of
      transfected cells were examined by transwell assay. RMST played its biological
      function through regulating the mRNA or protein expression in cytoplasm. CCK-8
      and colony formation assay unveiled that RMST could slow down the proliferation
      of TNBC cells to influence the tumor progression. TUNEL results revealed that
      RMST could enhance cell apoptosis in TNBC. The cell cycle detected by FCM assay
      indicated that RMST might induce the block of G0/G1 phase thus inhibiting TNBC
      cell proliferation. RMST overexpression could also restrain the invasion and
      migration abilities of TNBC cells. RMST played a role of tumor suppressor in TNBC
      through inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion and migration, enhancing cell
      apoptosis, and regulating cell cycle.

TI  - CLDN6 enhances chemoresistance to ADM via AF-6/ERKs pathway in TNBC cell line
      MDAMB231.
PG  - 169-180
LID - 10.1007/s11010-017-3221-8 [doi]
AB  - Claudin-6 (CLDN6), a critical tight junction protein acting as a tumor suppressor
      in breast cancer, is also considered to be a stem cell marker. Triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of claudin-low and stem cell-like breast cancer
      which is chemoresistant to multiple anti-cancer drugs. The aim of our study was
      to determine whether CLDN6 plays a role in chemoresistance of TNBC. We found that
      overexpression of CLDN6 in TNBC cell line MDAMB231 significantly inhibited cell
      growth, migration, and invasion. The expression of CLDN6 increased the IC50 of
      adriamycin (ADM) and promoted the clonogenic survival. CLDN6 inhibited
      ADM-induced apoptosis and senescence in MDAMB231 cells. However, P-gp, a
      resistance-related protein highly associated with chemoresistance, was
      downregulated by CLDN6 overexpression in MDAMB231 cells. Epithelial mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) marker E-cadherin was increased, and vimentin was decreased by
      CLDN6. In addition, stem cell markers OCT4, SOX2, and Nanog were dramatically
      increased. CLDN6 colocalized and interacted with AF-6. Overexpression of CLDN6
      increased the expression of afadin (AF-6) and hampered the activation of ERK
      signaling. PMA, a specific ERK activator, reversed the expression of EMT and stem
      cell markers, and decreased chemoresistance of MDAMB231 cells to ADM with a
      decreased IC50 and an increased apoptosis resulting from CLDN6. Together, we
      conclude that CLDN6 enhances the chemoresistance to ADM via activating the
      AF-6/ERK signaling pathway and up-regulating cancer stem cell characters in
      MDAMB231 cells.

AB  - Few reports in literature describe triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) imaging
      findings. Aim of the study is to determine MR-features of TNBC compared to
      receptor positive cancer (nTNBC). From May 2014 to May 2015, we retrospectively
      enrolled 31 consecutive patients with histological diagnosis of TNBC and a
      control group of 31 consecutive nTNBC observed in the same period, out of 602
      cancer, diagnosed in our department in the same year. Histopathological analysis 
      and MR-features of TNBC (31 patients) were compared to nTNBC (31 patients).
      MR-features included dimension, fibroglandular tissue (FGT), background
      parenchimal enhancement (BPE), mass shape, margins, presence of rim, intratumoral
      signal intensity in T2w, uni-multifocality, kinetic curves. All patients were
      examined with MR 1,5T (Magnetom Simphony Tim, Siemens Healthcare) performing T2w 
      fat-sat and contrast enhanced high temporal and spatial resolution T1w before and
      after injection of Gadolinium. 62 staging MR were reviewed. Median age was 50
      (30-78ys) with a standard deviation of 10,9. TNBC showed 3 MR features in
      concordance with current literature: rim enhancement, hyperintensity in T2
      sequence and unifocality. Rim enhancement was shown in 67.7% of TNBC (21/31) and 
      29% of nTNBC (9/31). Higher T2w values were shown in 83.9% of TNBC (26/31) and
      58.1% of nTNBC (18/31). Cancer was multifocal in 7/31 (22.6%) of TNBC and 19/31
      (61.3%) nTNBC. No correlation was found for dimension (p=0.12), FGT (p=0.959),
      BPE (p=0.596), homogeneity of enhancement (p=0.43), margins (p=0.671) and kinetic
      (p=0.37). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that rim enhancement and unifocality
      correlated independently with TNBC group. Area under ROC curve of our model is
      0.835. Furthermore, we evaluated the clinical outcome of all 31 TNBC patients in 
      a follow-up time ranging from 24months to 36months separating them in a
      free-survival group (23 women) and a recurrence group (8 women with local
      recurrence or distant metastasis): only kinetic curves resulted to be
      significantly higher in recurrence group (p=0.042).

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) often
      presents with a high histological grade and high malignancy, which greatly
      contribute to patient morbidity and mortality. Rhizoma Amorphophalli exhibits
      many biological and pharmacological activities, but its potential as a
      therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic TNBC patients remains poorly
      understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to determine whether
      Rhizoma Amorphophalli inhibits metastasis in the human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: CCK-8 and colony formation assays were adopted for the
      analysis of cell activity and cell proliferation, respectively. Flow cytometry
      was used for cell cycle analysis. Wound healing and transwell assays were
      performed to assess cell migration and invasion, respectively. PI3K/Akt/mTOR
      signaling pathways were analyzed through western blotting. Breast cancer cell
      metastasis to the lung in a xenograft model was evaluated by in vivo fluorescence
      imaging. A GC-MS analysis was performed to determine the main components of the
      petroleum ether fraction from the ethanol extract of Rhizoma Amorphophalli
      (abbreviated RhA). RESULTS: RhA significantly reduced breast cancer cell
      viability and proliferation. The flow cytometry analysis indicated that RhA
      induced MDA-MB-231 cell arrest at the S phase. Additionally, RhA decreased
      MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion and inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling 
      pathway. In addition, mice treated with RhA exhibited a significant reduction in 
      tumor infiltration and a decrease in breast cancer cell metastasis to the lung.
      The GC-MS analysis results showed that RhA contained a large number of
      unsaturated fatty acids, such as octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid),
      octadecatrienoic acid (linolenic acid), and oleate, which might represent the
      anticancer components of the extract. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study
      suggest that RhA has potential as a therapeutic candidate for metastatic TNBC
      treatment.

      enhances tumor growth and metastasis.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a metastatic disease is currently
      incurable. Reliable and reproducible methods for testing drugs against metastasis
      are not available. Stromal cells may play a critical role in tumor progression
      and metastasis. In this study, we determined that fibroblasts and macrophages
      secreted IL-8 upon induction by tumor cell-conditioned media (TCM) from
      MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Our data showed that the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
      cells co-cultured with fibroblasts or macrophages was enhanced compared to the
      monoculture. Furthermore, TNBC cell migration, a key step in tumor metastasis,
      was promoted by conditioned media (CM) from TCM-induced fibroblasts or
      macrophages. Knockdown of the IL-8 receptor CXCR2 by CRISPR-Cas9 reduces
      MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and migration compared to wild type. In a mouse
      xenograft tumor model, the growth of MDA-MB-231-CXCR2(-/-) tumor was
      significantly decreased compared to the growth of tumors from wild-type cells. In
      addition, the incidence of thoracic metastasis of MDA-MB-231-CXCR2(-/-) tumors
      was reduced compared to wild type. We found that the auto- and paracrine loop
      exists between TNBC cells and stroma, which results in enhanced IL-8 secretion
      from the stromal components. Significantly, inhibition of the IL-8 signaling
      pathway by reparixin, an inhibitor of the IL-8 receptor, CXCR1/2, reduced
      MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, these findings implicate 
      IL-8 signaling as a critical event in TNBC tumor growth and metastasis via
      crosstalk with stromal components.

TI  - Microarray-based SNP genotyping to identify genetic risk factors of
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in South Indian population.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1007/s11010-017-3187-6 [doi]
AB  - In the view of aggressive nature of Triple-Negative Breast cancer (TNBC) due to
      the lack of receptors (ER, PR, HER2) and high incidence of drug resistance
      associated with it, a case-control association study was conducted to identify
      the contributing genetic risk factors for Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). A
      total of 30 TNBC patients and 50 age and gender-matched controls of Indian origin
      were screened for 9,00,000 SNP markers using microarray-based SNP genotyping
      approach. The initial PLINK association analysis (p < 0.01, MAF 0.14-0.44, OR
      10-24) identified 28 non-synonymous SNPs and one stop gain mutation in the exonic
      region as possible determinants of TNBC risk. All the 29 SNPs were annotated
      using ANNOVAR. The interactions between these markers were evaluated using
      Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. The interactions were in the
      following order: exm408776 > exm1278309 > rs316389 > rs1651654 > rs635538 >
      exm1292477. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was performed to construct
      decision tree useful in predicting TNBC risk. As shown in this analysis,
      rs1651654 and exm585172 SNPs are found to be determinants of TNBC risk.
      Artificial neural network model was used to generate the Receiver operating
      characteristic curves (ROC), which showed high sensitivity and specificity
      (AUC-0.94) of these markers. To conclude, among the 9,00,000 SNPs tested, CCDC42 
      exm1292477, ANXA3 exm408776, SASH1 exm585172 are found to be the most significant
      genetic predicting factors for TNBC. The interactions among exm408776,
      exm1278309, rs316389, rs1651654, rs635538, exm1292477 SNPs inflate the risk for
      TNBC further. Targeted analysis of these SNPs and genes alone also will have
      similar clinical utility in predicting TNBC.

TI  - Kaiso is highly expressed in TNBC tissues of women of African ancestry compared
      to Caucasian women.
PG  - 1295-1304
LID - 10.1007/s10552-017-0955-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most prevalent in young women of
      African ancestry (WAA) compared to women of other ethnicities. Recent studies
      found a correlation between high expression of the transcription factor Kaiso,
      TNBC aggressiveness, and ethnicity. However, little is known about Kaiso
      expression and localization patterns in TNBC tissues of WAA. Herein, we analyze
      Kaiso expression patterns in TNBC tissues of African (Nigerian), Caribbean
      (Barbados), African American (AA), and Caucasian American (CA) women. METHODS:
      Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) TNBC tissue blocks from Nigeria and
      Barbados were utilized to construct a Nigerian/Barbadian tissue microarray
      (NB-TMA). This NB-TMA and a commercially available TMA comprising AA and CA TNBC 
      tissues (AA-CA-YTMA) were subjected to immunohistochemistry to assess Kaiso
      expression and subcellular localization patterns, and correlate Kaiso expression 
      with TNBC clinical features. RESULTS: Nigerian and Barbadian women in our study
      were diagnosed with TNBC at a younger age than AA and CA women. Nuclear and
      cytoplasmic Kaiso expression was observed in all tissues analyzed. Analysis of
      Kaiso expression in the NB-TMA and AA-CA-YTMA revealed that nuclear Kaiso H
      scores were significantly higher in Nigerian, Barbadian, and AA women compared
      with CA women. However, there was no statistically significant difference in
      nuclear Kaiso expression between Nigerian versus Barbadian women, or Barbadian
      versus AA women. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of nuclear Kaiso expression were
      detected in patients with a higher degree of African heritage compared to their
      Caucasian counterparts, suggesting a role for Kaiso in TNBC racial disparity.

TI  - Up-modulation of PLC-beta2 reduces the number and malignancy of triple-negative
      breast tumor cells with a CD133(+)/EpCAM(+) phenotype: a promising target for
      preventing progression of TNBC.
PG  - 617
LID - 10.1186/s12885-017-3592-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The malignant potential of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is
      also dependent on a sub-population of cells with a stem-like phenotype. Among the
      cancer stem cell markers, CD133 and EpCAM strongly correlate with breast tumor
      aggressiveness, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of the two surface
      antigens may be beneficial in treatment of TNBC. Since in TNBC-derived cells we
      demonstrated that PLC-beta2 induces the conversion of CD133(high) to CD133(low)
      cells, here we explored its possible role in down-modulating the expression of
      both CD133 and EpCAM and, ultimately, in reducing the number of TNBC cells with a
      stem-like phenotype. METHODS: A magnetic step-by-step cell isolation with
      antibodies directed against CD133 and/or EpCAM was performed on the TNBC-derived 
      MDA-MB-231 cell line. In the same cell model, PLC-beta2 was over-expressed or
      down-modulated and cell proliferation and invasion capability were evaluated by
      Real-time cell assays. The surface expression of CD133, EpCAM and CD44 in the
      different experimental conditions were measured by multi-color flow cytometry
      immunophenotyping. RESULTS: A CD133(+)/EpCAM(+) sub-population with high
      proliferation rate and invasion capability is present in the MDA-MB-231 cell
      line. Over-expression of PLC-beta2 in CD133(+)/EpCAM(+) cells reduced the surface
      expression of both CD133 and EpCAM, as well as proliferation and invasion
      capability of this cellular subset. On the other hand, the up-modulation of
      PLC-beta2 in the whole MDA-MB-231 cell population reduced the number of cells
      with a CD44(+)/CD133(+)/EpCAM(+) stem-like phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Since
      selective targeting of the cells with the highest aggressive potential may have a
      great clinical importance for TNBC, the up-modulation of PLC-beta2, reducing the 
      number of cells with a stem-like phenotype, may be a promising goal for novel
      therapies aimed to prevent the progression of aggressive breast tumors.

AB  - The lack of targeted therapies available for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      patients who fail to respond to first-line chemotherapy has sparked interest in
      immunotherapeutic approaches. However, trials utilizing checkpoint inhibitors
      targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in TNBC have had underwhelming responses. Here, we 
      investigated the interplay between type I IFN signaling and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
      and tested the impact of combining IFN inducers, as immune activators, with
      anti-PD-1, to induce an antimetastatic immune response. Using models of TNBC, we 
      demonstrated an interplay between type I IFN signaling and tumor cell PD-L1
      expression that affected therapeutic response. The data revealed that the type I 
      IFN-inducer poly(I:C) was an effective immune activator and antimetastatic agent,
      functioning better than anti-PD-1, which was ineffective as a single agent.
      Poly(I:C) treatment induced PD-L1 expression on TNBC cells, and combined
      poly(I:C) and anti-PD-1 treatment prolonged metastasis-free survival in a
      neoadjuvant setting via the induction of a tumor-specific T-cell response. Use of
      this combination in a late treatment setting did not impact metastasis-free
      survival, indicating that timing was critical for immunotherapeutic benefit.
      Together, these data demonstrated anti-PD-1 as an ineffective single agent in
      preclinical models of TNBC. However, type I IFN inducers were effective immune
      activators, and neoadjuvant trials combining them with anti-PD-1 to induce a
      sustained antitumor immune response are warranted. Cancer Immunol Res; 5(10);

TI  - Recurrent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues contain a higher amount of
      phosphatidylcholine (32:1) than non-recurrent TNBC tissues.
PG  - e0183724
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0183724 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the breast cancer subtype that
      displays a high risk of early recurrence and short overall survival. Improvement 
      of the prognosis of patients with TNBC requires identifying a predictive factor
      of recurrence, which would make it possible to provide beneficial personalized
      treatment. However, no clinically reliable predictive factor is currently known. 
      In this study, we investigated the predictive factor of recurrence in TNBC using 
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry for lipid
      profiling of breast cancer specimens obtained from three and six patients with
      recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC, respectively. The signal for
      phosphatidylcholine (PC) (32:1) at m/z 732.5 was significantly higher in the
      recurrence group compared to the non-recurrence group (P = 0.024). PC (32:1) was 
      more abundant in the cancer epithelial area than it was in the surrounding
      stroma, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with malignant
      transformation. Our results indicate PC (32:1) as a candidate predictive factor
      of TNBC recurrence. A future prospective study investigating whether personalized
      therapy based on PC (32:1) intensity improves the prognosis of patients with TNBC
      is recommended.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is an unmet need in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      patients for targeted therapies. Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) 
      is a promising target for inhibition based on the abundance of correlative and
      functional data supporting its role in various cancer types. Areas covered: This 
      review endeavors to outline the role of MELK in cancer. Studies covering a range 
      of biological functions including proliferation, apoptosis, cancer stem cell
      phenotypes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and therapy
      resistance are discussed here in order to understand the potential of MELK as a
      clinically significant target for TNBC patients. Expert opinion: Targeting MELK
      may offer a novel therapeutic opportunity in TNBC and other cancers. Despite the 
      abundance of correlative data, there is still much we do not know. There are a
      lack of potent, specific inhibitors against MELK, as well as an insufficient
      understanding of MELK's downstream substrates. Addressing these issues is the
      first step toward identifying a patient population that could benefit from MELK
      inhibition in combination with other therapies.

TI  - STAT3 activation by leptin receptor is essential for TNBC stem cell maintenance.
PG  - 415-426
LID - 10.1530/ERC-16-0349 [doi]
AB  - Leptin (LEP) binds to the long form of the leptin receptor (LEPRb), leading to
      the activation of multiple signaling pathways that are potential targets for
      disrupting the obesity-breast cancer link. In triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC), LEP is hypothesized to predominantly mediate its tumorigenic effects via 
      a subpopulation of LEPRb-positive tumor cells termed cancer stem cells (CSCs)
      that can initiate tumors and induce tumor progression. Previously, we showed that
      LEP promotes CSC survival in vivo Moreover, silencing LEPRb in TNBC cells
      compromised the CSC state. The mechanisms by which LEPRb regulates TNBC CSC
      intracellular signaling are not clear. We hypothesized that activation of LEPRb
      signaling is sufficient to drive CSC maintenance in TNBC. Here, we show that
      activation of LEPRb in non-CSCs isolated using our CSC reporter system resulted
      in a transition to the stem cell state. In CSCs, LEP induced STAT3
      phosphorylation, whereas LEP did not induce STAT3 phosphorylation in non-CSCs.
      Introduction of constitutively active STAT3 into LEPRb-transfected non-CSCs
      significantly induced NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4 expression compared with control
      non-CSCs. To determine the intracellular phospho-tyrosine residue of LEPRb that
      is necessary for the induction of the stem cell state in non-CSCs, we transfected
      the tyrosine residue point mutants L985, F1077 and S1138 into non-CSCs. Non-CSCs 
      transfected with the L985 mutant exhibited increased STAT3 phosphorylation,
      increased SOCS3 expression and an induction of GFP expression compared with
      non-CSCs expressing the F1077 and S1138 mutants. Our data demonstrate that
      LEPRb-induced STAT3 activation is essential for the induction and maintenance of 
      TNBC CSCs.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) a clinically aggressive subtype of breast
      cancer with poor outcomes. Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of many TNBCs,
      and likely underlies its ability to adapt and rapidly become resistant to
      chemotherapy. A study of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have
      identified biological mechanisms driving this resistance to chemotherapy. Copy
      number amplifications such as MCL1, MYC and JAK2, as well as PTEN deletions or
      mutations have all been identified at a higher frequency in residual disease,
      suggesting they may play a role in de novo or acquired chemotherapy resistance.
      Increased copy number and expression of the PIM1 proto-oncogene in TNBC has also 
      been identified as a new target of chemotherapy resistance. However, given the
      genomic instability and subclonal nature of driver mutations in TNBC, single
      agent targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective. Lately immune evasion has
      also been identified as another key characteristic of poor prognostic and
      chemo-resistant primary TNBCs. Combinations of checkpoint inhibition with
      targeted therapy and/or chemotherapy are currently being investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Jagged1/Notch3 signaling pathway plays a key role in
      angiogenesis of breast cancer, but little is known in TNBC. This study was
      designed to investigate the expression of Jagged1/Notch3 mRNA and protein in
      TNBC, analyze their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and
      prognosis. Moreover, the interrelationship among Jagged1/Notch3 and VEGF was
      initially evaluated. METHODS: Jagged1/Notch3 mRNA and protein expression levels
      were determined by Q-RT-PCR and Western blotting. Additionally,
      Immunohistochemistry for Jagged1/Notch3 was detected by Ventana platform, VEGF
      and CD34 was performed using the EnVision/HRP technique. RESULTS: mRNA
      transcriptionof Jagged1/Notch3 was in accord with protein expression. TNBC
      patients with positive Jagged1 expression had poorer DFS (p = 0.008) and OS (p = 
      0.004). Jagged1 expression was independent predictors of OS (p = 0.038). The
      expression of VEGF was positively correlative to MVD (p = 0.018), MVD was
      significantly associated with Jagged1 (p <0.0001) and Notch3 (p <0.0001). The
      expression of Jagged1/Notch3 has no correlation with VEGF, only in positive VEGF 
      expression of TNBC patients Jagged1/Notch3 had influence on DFS and OS (p <0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Jagged1/Notch3 was -expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels,
      Jagged1 served as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. We speculate that
      there is a cross-talk between Jagged1/Notch3 and VEGF in TNBC angiogenesis.
      Jagged1/Notch3 is expected to be an important signaling pathway for TNBC
      progression and a potential target for TNBC neovascularization therapy.

TI  - The therapeutic candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitors elucidated by the
      status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed death ligand 1
      (PD-L1) expression in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PG  - 34-42
LID - 10.1007/s12282-017-0781-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a prognostic
      factor for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Recent studies have shown that
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed 
      on T lymphocytes or tumor cells modulating antitumor immunity. The regulation of 
      immune checkpoints between tumor cells and T lymphocytes may serve as a target
      for improvement of TNBC prognosis. We investigated TILs and PD-L1 status in TNBCs
      before or after preoperative systemic therapy (PST) to elucidate the clinical
      significance of PD-L1 expression. METHODS: Ninety patients received PST, and
      materials of core needle biopsies (CNB) taken before PST were available for 32
      patients. TILs were scored as "% stromal", and tumors were defined as High-TILs
      (>/=30%) or Low-TILs (<30%). The expression of PD-L1 was assessed by
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: TILs status in CNB is significant in pathological 
      therapeutic grade: 1 vs. 2 or 3 (p = 0.0359). Disease-free survival (DFS) in
      patients with Low-TIL tumors were significantly worse than those with High-TIL
      tumors (p = 0.0383), but overall survival (OS) showed no significance (p =
      0.0772). However, in patients with Low-TIL tumors, both DFS and OS in patients
      with High-PD-L1 expression were extremely unfavorable than in patients with
      Low-PD-L1 expression (p = 0.0032, p = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: The patients with
      TNBCs with combined Low-TILs and High-PD-L1 status in pre-PST situation showed
      unfavorable prognosis. The subset of TNBCs with Low-TILs and High-PD-L1 status
      could be the therapeutic target for immune checkpoint inhibitor.

TI  - Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) expression is an independent prognostic factor
      in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PG  - e6561
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006561 [doi]
AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subset of breast cancer that is highly 
      aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Meanwhile, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are also
      characterized by a strong tumorigenic potential, which might be partly
      responsible for the aggressive behavior of TNBC. We previously showed that CSCs
      are enriched in TNBC cell lines and tissues. Further experiments in animal models
      revealed higher tumorigenicity of CSCs sorted from TNBC cell lines. In this
      study, we aimed to determine the clinical relationship between CSCs and TNBC by
      exploring the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), which is a putative
      marker of breast CSCs, in TNBC tissues.ALDH1 levels in paraffin-embedded tumor
      tissues from 158 TNBC patients were evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining
      using an ALDH1A1 primary antibody. Staining evaluation was performed
      independently by two pathologists, and the expression level of ALDH1 was
      evaluated in terms of the percentage and intensity of positive cells. The
      association of immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 expression with clinical
      parameters was also analyzed.ALDH1 expression in tumor cells was observed in 88
      out of 158 cases (55.7%). Analysis of clinicopathological parameters showed that 
      the immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 was significantly correlated with
      tumor size (P = 0.02) and stage (P = 0.04). Survival analysis in patients with
      ALDH1 expression demonstrated shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall
      survival (OS) times (P = 0.01; P = 0.001). Moreover, Cox multivariate analysis
      revealed that ALDH1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of RFS and
      OS (P = 0.04; P = 0.04).Immunohistochemistry staining of ALDH1 in tumor cells is 
      an independent prognostic indicator of RFS and OS in TNBC patients.

AB  - Despite recent advances in molecularly directed therapy, triple negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) remains one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, still
      without a suitable target for specific inhibitors. Maternal embryonic leucine
      zipper kinase (MELK) is highly expressed in TNBC, where level of overexpression
      correlates with poor prognosis and an aggressive disease course. Herein, we
      describe the discovery through targeted kinase inhibitor library screening, and
      structure-guided design of a series of ATP-competitive indolinone derivatives
      with subnanomolar inhibition constants towards MELK. The most potent compound,
      17, inhibits the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and proliferation
      of TNBC cells exhibiting selectivity for cells expressing high levels of MELK.
      These studies suggest that further elaboration of 17 will furnish MELK-selective 
      inhibitors with potential for development in preclinical models of TNBC and other
      cancers.

TI  - A Randomized Phase II Neoadjuvant Study of Cisplatin, Paclitaxel With or Without 
      Everolimus in Patients with Stage II/III Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC):
      Responses and Long-term Outcome Correlated with Increased Frequency of DNA Damage
      Response Gene Mutations, TNBC Subtype, AR Status, and Ki67.
PG  - 4035-4045

AB  - Purpose: Because of inherent disease heterogeneity, targeted therapies have
      eluded triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and biomarkers predictive of
      treatment response have not yet been identified. This study was designed to
      determine whether the mTOR inhibitor everolimus with cisplatin and paclitaxel
      would provide synergistic antitumor effects in TNBC.Methods: Patients with stage 
      II/III TNBC were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of preoperative weekly
      cisplatin, paclitaxel and daily everolimus or placebo for 12 weeks, until
      definitive surgery. Tumor specimens were obtained at baseline, cycle 1, and
      surgery. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR); secondary
      endpoints included clinical responses, breast conservation rate, safety, and
      discovery of molecular features associated with outcome.Results: Between 2009 and
      2013, 145 patients were accrued; 36% of patients in the everolimus arm and 49% of
      patients in the placebo arm achieved pCR; in each arm, 50% of patients achieved
      complete responses by imaging. Higher rates of neutropenia, mucositis, and
      transaminase elevation were seen with everolimus. Clinical response to therapy
      and long-term outcome correlated with increased frequency of DNA damage response 
      (DDR) gene mutations, Basal-like1 and Mesenchymal TNBC-subtypes, AR-negative
      status, and high Ki67, but not with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.Conclusions:
      The paclitaxel/cisplatin combination was well tolerated and active, but addition 
      of everolimus was associated with more adverse events without improvement in pCR 
      or clinical response. However, discoveries made from correlative studies could
      lead to predictive TNBC biomarkers that may impact clinical decision-making and
      provide new avenues for mechanistic exploration that could lead to clinical
      utility. Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4035-45. (c)2017 AACR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are characterized 
      by an unfavorable prognosis particularly when not responding well to
      anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy. This is due to a more aggressive biology in
      some cases but most importantly to a lack of agents other than conventional
      chemotherapy. Hence, there is an urgent need to optimize therapy of patients with
      TNBC in order to improve prognosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to
      present the current understanding of TNBC biology and give an insight of current 
      therapeutic concepts in the neoadjuvant treatment setting. METHOD: Current
      literature has been selected based on a literature search and current therapeutic
      concepts are explained and commented on. RESULTS: Novel therapeutic concepts for 
      patients with TNBC focus on a) chemotherapy optimization through alternate
      scheduling, dosing or alternative/additional chemotherapeutic agents, b)
      evaluation of novel targeted agents and c) identification of clinically relevant 
      patient subgroups through prognostic/ predictive biomarkers to enable a more
      personalized treatment approach. Potential novel therapeutic targets include
      inhibition of Poly-A-Ribose-Polymerase (PARP), checkpoint inhibition and
      antiandrogenic agents. CONCLUSION: Treatment of TNBC is currently been optimized 
      both through optimization of chemotherapy and introduction of novel targeted
      agents which should enhance treatment response rates in the future.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in Black breast cancer survivors with and without 
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PG  - 331-342
LID - 10.1007/s10549-017-4173-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Black women are more likely to develop early-onset (</=50 years) breast 
      cancer (BC) and have the lowest five-year, cause-specific survival rate of any
      United States (U.S.) racial or ethnic group. These disparities can be attributed 
      partially to the higher rate of triple-negative BC (TNBC) in Blacks. Yet, little 
      is known about health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Black women with
      TNBC. METHODS: Black women with invasive BC </= 50 years were recruited via the
      Florida Cancer Data System as part of a population-based case-only study of
      etiology and outcomes of early-onset invasive BC. Of 460 consented participants, 
      a subset of 355 self-reported sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial
      variables. Descriptive analyses included participants with known TNBC (n = 85) or
      non-TNBC (n = 245) disease. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted
      to examine differences in factors associated with HRQOL. RESULTS: In unadjusted
      analyses, TNBC participants had significantly lower FACT-B total scores (90.1 +/-
      27.9) compared to non-TNBC (98.5 +/- 27.6) participants (p < 0.05). For the TNBC 
      group, multivariable analyses indicated five individual-level, and three
      systemic-level factors explain 80% of the response variation in HRQOL. For the
      non-TNBC group, seven individual-level factors and three systemic-level factors
      account for 76% of the variation in HRQOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to Black 
      women with non-TNBC, TNBC women have worse HRQOL. There are key individual and
      systemic-level factors that are unique to both groups. Findings can inform future
      HRQOL interventions to support young Black BC survivors.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), owing to its aggressive behavior and
      toxicity associated with available chemotherapy; currently no suitable therapy is
      available. Honokiol (HNK) is a promising anticancer drug but has poor
      bioavailability. In the current study, we evaluated the anticancer effects of an 
      oral Honokiol nanomicellar (NM) formulation (size range of 20-40nm) in vitro
      against various TNBC cells lines. Cytotoxicity, clonogenic and wound healing
      assays demonstrated the promising anticancer effects. In vitro Caco-2
      permeability studies suggested increased absorption of Honokiol. Compared to
      HNK-FD, nanomicellar formulations resulted in significant increase in the oral
      bioavailability. Cmax (4.06 and 3.60-fold) and AUC (6.26 and 5.83-fold) were
      significantly increased in comparison to oral 40 and 80mg/kg free drug
      respectively. Further, anticancer effects of these formulations were studied in
      BALB/c nude mice transplanted with orthotopic MDA-MB-231 cell induced xenografts.
      After 4 weeks of daily administration of HNK-NM formulation, significant
      reduction in the tumor volumes and weights compared to free drug (p<0.001)
      treated groups was observed. Surprisingly, in some of the animals (25%), the
      treatment resulted in complete eradication of tumors. Increased apoptosis and
      antiangiogenic effect was observed in HNK-NM groups compared to free drug and
      untreated control animals. This is the first report demonstrating that HNK-FD
      possesses anticancer effects against TNBC.

      TNBC.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC, lacks expression of estrogen receptor (ER), 
      progesterone receptor (PR), and amplification of HER2/Neu] remains one of the
      most aggressive subtypes, affects the youngest patients, and still lacks an
      effective targeted therapy. Both phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-alpha and
      -beta contribute to oncogenesis of solid tumors, including the development of
      breast cancer. Inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) catalyzes
      the removal of the 4'-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4)-bisphosphate
      (PI-3,4-P2), creating phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. There is debate
      concerning whether PI-3,4-P2 contributes to Akt and downstream effector
      activation with the known canonical signaling second messenger,
      phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). If PI-3,4-P2 is a positive
      effector, INPP4B would be a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, and there is
      some evidence to support this. Utilizing phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
      on chromosome ten (PTEN)-null triple-negative breast tumor cell lines, it was
      unexpectedly found that silencing INPP4B decreased basal phospho-Akt (pAkt) and
      cellular proliferation, and in most cases sensitized cells to PI3K-alpha and
      PI3K-beta isoform-specific inhibitors. Conversely, overexpression of INPP4B
      desensitized cells to PI3K inhibitors in a phosphatase activity-dependent manner.
      In summary, the current investigation of INPP4B in PTEN-null TNBC suggests new
      mechanistic insight and the potential for targeted therapy for this aggressive
      subset of breast cancer.Implications: These data support a model where PI-3,4-P2 
      is inhibitory toward PI3K, revealing a novel feedback mechanism under conditions 
      of excessive signaling, and potentially an indication for PI3K-beta
      isoform-specific inhibitors in PTEN-null TNBC that have lost INPP4B expression.

AB  - The mechanisms modulating the cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells were not fully understood. In this study, we 
      performed data mining in Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner v4.0 and found that 
      TNBC tumors had significantly higher NES mRNA expression than other breast cancer
      subtypes. Pooled data suggested that NES mRNA expression is associated worse
      metastatic relapse (MR) free survival and also worse any event (AE) free survival
      in TNBC patients. Following data mining in multiple big data databases confirmed 
      a positive correlation between SOX10 mRNA expression and NES mRNA expression in
      breast cancer tissues. In addition, the expression of SOX10 mRNA is significantly
      higher in TNBC tissues than in other breast cancer subtypes. SOX10 overexpression
      resulted in Nestin upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels. Bioinformatic
      analysis predicted a SOX10 binding site in NES promoter and the following dual
      luciferase assay verified the binding site. Functionally, SOX10 overexpression
      substantially increased CSC properties of TNBC cells, while SOX10 knockdown
      decreased the CSC properties, in terms of CD24(-)/CD44(+) cell ratio and
      tumorsphere-forming capabilities. Enforced Nestin expression partly counteracted 
      the effect of SOX10 knockdown on reducing the CSC properties. Based on these
      findings, we infer that SOX10 regulates cancer stem cell properties of TNBC cells
      via inducing Nestin expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) carries a worse
      prognosis compared to the other subtypes. There have been conflicting studies
      that race may impact the prognosis of TNBC patients. We aim to determine the
      incidence and prognosis of TNBC among the different ethnic races in Singapore,
      and to determine its associated risk factors for prognosis. METHODS: Patients
      diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (BC) from 2005 to 2013 at our tertiary
      institution were included and divided according to race and subtypes. Demographic
      and clinical information of non-metastatic TNBC patients were analyzed. Log-rank 
      test, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were 
      used to find associated risk factors related with overall survival (OS) and
      disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Among 1227 BC patients, 129 (10.5%) had
      TNBC. TNBC patients had the worst OS (P: 0.0005) and DFS (P: 0.0016) among the
      subtypes. However, variations in race did not have any difference in OS or DFS
      among TNBC patients. Axillary lymph node involvement, invasive lobular histology,
      larger tumor size, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were factors
      associated with both poor DFS and OS among TNBC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Racial
      variation did not have any impact on the prognosis of the TNBC.

      syndecan-binding protein (SDCBP) in TNBC inhibits the proliferation of TNBC
      cells. Dasatinib is a new small-molecule inhibitor of c-src phosphorylation. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate if SDCBP is a potential marker to indicate
      whether a TNBC is suitable for dasatinib therapy. This study applied
      co-immunoprecipitation to identify the interaction between SDCBP and c-src in
      TNBC cell lines. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to investigate SDCBP 
      and tyrosine-419 phosphorylated c-src (p-c-src-Y419) expression in TNBC tissues. 
      SDCBP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were then constructed to evaluate the
      effects of dasatinib on SDCBP-induced TNBC progression in vitro and tumor
      formation in nude mice. We found wild-type SDCBP interacted with c-src and
      promoted the phosphorylation of c-src; this phosphorylation was completely
      blocked by dasatinib. SDCBP lacking the PDZ domain had no such effect. Among the 
      52 consecutive random TNBC cases examined, the expression of SDCBP was consistent
      with that of p-c-src-Y419, and positively correlated with histological grading or
      Ki-67 levels. SDCBP overexpression significantly accelerated the proliferation
      and cell cycle progression of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231; these effects were
      prevented by dasatinib treatment. However, the subsequent inhibition of p27
      expression partially restored the proliferation and viability of the TNBC cells. 
      The results of this study suggest that SDCBP interacts with c-src, regulates G1/S
      in TNBC cells, and enhances tumor cell proliferation by promoting the tyrosine
      phosphorylation of c-src at residue 419. Dasatinib inhibits such phosphorylation 
      and blocks SDCBP-induced cell cycle progression. Therefore, SDCBP might be an
      important marker for identifying TNBC cases that are suitable for dasatinib
      therapy.

AB  - Cancer tissue functions as an ecosystem of a diverse set of cells that interact
      in a complex tumor microenvironment. Genomic tools applied to biopsies in bulk
      fail to account for this tumor heterogeneity, whereas single-cell imaging methods
      limit the number of cells which can be assessed or are very resource intensive.
      The current study presents methods based on flow cytometric analysis and cell
      sorting using known cell surface markers (CXCR4/CD184, CD24, THY1/CD90) to
      identify and interrogate distinct groups of cells in triple-negative breast
      cancer clinical biopsy specimens from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The
      results demonstrate that flow cytometric analysis allows a relevant subgrouping
      of cancer tissue and that sorting of these subgroups provides insights into
      cancer cell populations with unique, reproducible, and functionally divergent
      gene expression profiles. The discovery of a drug resistance signature implies
      that uncovering the functional interaction between these populations will lead to
      deeper understanding of cancer progression and drug response.Implications:
      PDX-derived human breast cancer tissue was investigated at the single-cell level,
      and cell subpopulations defined by surface markers were identified which suggest 
      specific roles for distinct cellular compartments within a solid tumor. Mol

TI  - Identification and targeting of microRNAs modulating acquired chemotherapy
      resistance in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC): A better strategy to combat
      chemoresistance.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous form of malignant
      disease. Due to lack of proper therapeutic target treatment options are
      restricted and relies primarily on chemotherapeutic modality for treatment of
      patients. Despite significant early regression of the disease in response to
      chemotherapy, complete cure is not assured with development of resistant tumors
      which is difficult to manage clinically. In the last decades, the regulation and 
      contribution of microRNAs in tumorigenesis including breast cancers have been
      well-documented. Thus, here it is hypothesized that by identifying the microRNAs 
      responsible for chemoresistance in TNBC and targeting the microRNAs along with
      chemotherapeutic approaches might exert an improved response. To accomplish this,
      an in vivo screening has to be performed by transfecting tumor cell line with
      lentiviral pool of library expressing microRNAs. Following treatment of primary
      tumors in mice and growth of relapsed tumors, microRNA profile has to be analyzed
      by qRT-PCR and sequencing to detect the microRNAs contributing to the
      chemoresistance which can be targeted by anti-microRNA strategies.

TI  - Targeting of PYK2 Synergizes with EGFR Antagonists in Basal-like TNBC and
      Circumvents HER3-Associated Resistance via the NEDD4-NDRG1 Axis.
PG  - 86-99
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1797 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive, heterogeneous
      disease with poor prognosis and no effective targeted therapies. EGFR is highly
      expressed in basal-like TNBC and is considered as a potential therapeutic target.
      However, EGFR targeting exerts only marginal clinical benefits, possibly due to
      activation of compensatory signaling pathways, which are frequently associated
      with HER3 upregulation. Here we show that concomitant targeting of EGFR and the
      nonreceptor tyrosine kinases PYK2/FAK synergistically inhibits the proliferation 
      of basal-like TNBC cells in vitro and attenuates tumor growth in a mouse
      xenograft model. Dual targeting of EGFR and PYK2/FAK inhibited complementary key 
      growth and survival pathways mediated by AKT, S6K, STAT3, and ERK1/2 activation. 
      PYK2 inhibition also abrogated HER3 upregulation in response to EGFR antagonists,
      thereby circumventing HER3-associated drug resistance. Mechanistically, PYK2
      inhibition facilitated the proteasomal degradation of HER3 while inducing
      upregulation of NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated 1 gene). NDRG1 enhanced the
      interaction of HER3 with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, while PYK2, which interacts 
      with NEDD4 and HER3, interfered with NEDD4-HER3 binding, suggesting that the
      PYK2-NDRG1-NEDD4 circuit has a critical role in receptor degradation, drug
      response, and resistance mechanism. Our studies offer a preclinical proof of
      concept for a strategy of cotargeting the EGFR and PYK2/FAK kinases to improve
      TNBC therapy. Cancer Res; 77(1); 86-99. (c)2016 AACR.

PG  - 1864-1872
AB  - Treatment protocols for breast cancer depend predominantly on receptor status
      with respect to estrogen (estrogen receptor alpha), progesterone (progesterone
      receptor) and human epidermal growth factor [human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)]. The presence of one or more of these receptors suggests that 
      a treatment targeting these pathways might be effective, while the absence of, or
      in the case of HER2, lack of overexpression of, all of these receptors, termed
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), indicates a need for the more toxic
      chemotherapy. In an effort to develop targeted therapies for TNBC, it will be
      necessary to differentiate among specific TNBC subtypes. The subset of TNBC that 
      expresses androgen receptor (AR) has been determined to express genes consistent 
      with a luminal subtype and therefore may be amenable to therapies targeting
      either AR, itself, or other pathways typical of a luminal subtype. Recent
      investigations of the AR signal pathway within breast cancer lead to AR as a
      significant target for breast cancer therapy with several clinical trials
      currently in progress. The subclass of TNBC that lacks AR, which we have termed
      quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC) currently lacks a defined targetable
      pathway. Unlike AR-positive TNBC, QNBC predominantly exhibits a basal-like
      molecular subtype. Several subtypes and related pathway proteins are
      preferentially expressed in QNBC that may serve as effective targets for
      treatment, such as ACSL4, SKP2 and EGFR. ACSL4 expression has been demonstrated
      to be inversely correlated with expression of hormone/growth factor receptors and
      may thus serve as a biomarker for QNBC as well as a target for therapy. In the
      following review we summarize some of the current efforts to develop alternatives
      to chemotherapy for TNBC and QNBC.

      Serum Levels in TNBC Patients.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer
      antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) levels are both independent prognostic factors in breast
      cancer. However, the utility of CEA and CA15-3 levels as conventional cancer
      biomarkers in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains
      controversial. The current study was performed to explore the predictive value of
      pre-therapeutic serum CEA and CA15-3 levels, and nomograms were developed
      including these serum cancer biomarkers to improve the prognostic evaluation of
      TNBC patients. Pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA concentrations were measured in 247
      patients with stage I-IV TNBC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that TNBC patients
      with high levels of both CEA and CA15-3 had shorter overall survival (OS) and
      disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those in the low-level groups (p<0.05).
      Multivariate analysis suggested that pre-therapeutic CA15-3 and CEA levels are
      independent predictive elements for OS (p = 0.022 and p = 0.040, respectively)
      and DFS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.028, respectively). In addition, novel nomograms
      were established and validated to provide personal forecasts of OS and DFS for
      patients with TNBC. These novel nomograms may help physicians to select the
      optimal treatment plans to ensure the best outcomes for TNBC patients.

AB  - We investigated gene expression profiles of the NF-kappaB pathway in patients
      with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) receiving adjuvant chemotherapy to
      determine the prognostic value of NF-kappaB pathway genes according to
      chemotherapeutic regimen. We used the nCounter expression assay to measure
      expression of 11 genes (NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, RELB, REL, TP53, FOXC1, TBP, SP1,
      STAT3 and IRF1 genes) belonging to the NF-kappaB pathway using mRNA extracted
      from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 203 patients diagnosed with TNBC. Of
      the 203 patients, 116 were treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen containing
      doxorubicin. As revealed by the expression profiles of the 11 genes, increased
      expression of SP1 was associated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients treated
      with adjuvant doxorubicin chemotherapy (5-year distant recurrence-free survival
      [5Y DRFS], low vs. high expression [cut-off: median]: 92.3% vs. 71.6%, P =
      0.001). In a multivariate Cox regression model, SP1 expression was a useful
      marker for predicting long-term prognosis in TNBC patients receiving doxorubicin 
      treatment, and we thus suggest that SP1 expression could serve as a prognostic
      marker in these patients.

TI  - IL-17E synergizes with EGF and confers in vitro resistance to EGFR-targeted
      therapies in TNBC cells.
PG  - 53350-53361
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.10804 [doi]
AB  - Estrogen receptor-, progesterone receptor- and HER2-negative breast cancers, also
      known as triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), have poor prognoses and are
      refractory to current therapeutic agents, including epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents is often
      associated with sustained kinase phosphorylation, which promotes EGFR activation 
      and translocation to the nucleus and prevents these agents from acting on their
      targets. The mechanisms underlying this resistance have not been fully
      elucidated. In addition, the IL-17E receptor is overexpressed in TNBC tumors and 
      is associated with a poor prognosis. We have previously reported that IL-17E
      promotes TNBC resistance to anti-mitotic therapies. Here, we investigated whether
      IL-17E promotes TNBC resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents by exploring the 
      link between the IL-17E/IL-17E receptor axis and EGF signaling. We found that
      IL-17E, similarly to EGF, activates the EGFR in TNBC cells that are resistant to 
      EGFR inhibitors. It also activates the PYK-2, Src and STAT3 kinases, which are
      essential for EGFR activation and nuclear translocation. IL-17E binds its
      specific receptor, IL-17RA/IL17RB, on these TNBC cells and synergizes with the
      EGF signaling pathway, thereby inducing Src-dependent EGFR transactivation and
      pSTAT3 and pEGFR translocation to the nucleus. Collectively, our data indicate
      that the IL-17E/IL-17E receptor axis may underlie TNBC resistance to EGFR
      inhibitors and suggest that inhibiting IL-17E or its receptor in combination with
      EGFR inhibitor administration may improve TNBC management.

AB  - PURPOSE: The optimum local surgical strategy regarding breast-conserving therapy 
      (BCT) for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is controversial. To investigate
      whether BCT is appropriate for patients with TNBC, we evaluated the clinical
      outcomes of BCT in women with TNBC compared to those of women without TNBC, using
      a large, single-center cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of 1533 women (TNBC n=321; non-TNBC n=1212) who underwent 
      BCT for primary breast cancer between 2000 and 2010. Clinicopathological
      characteristics, locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and overall
      survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Tumors from the TNBC group had a higher T
      stage (T2 37.4% vs. 21.0%, p<0.001), a lower N stage (N0 86.9% vs. 75.5%,
      p<0.001), and a higher histologic grade (Grade III 66.8% vs. 15.4%, p<0.001) than
      the non-TNBC group. There were no differences in 5-year LRFS rates between the
      TNBC and non-TNBC groups (98.7% vs. 97.8%, p=0.63). The non-TNBC group showed a
      slightly better 5-year OS than the TNBC group; however, the difference was not
      significant (96.2% vs. 97.3%, p=0.72). In multivariate analyses, TNBC was not
      associated with poor clinical outcomes in terms of LRFS and OS [hazard ratio (HR)
      for LRFS=0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10-1.31; HR for OS=1.03, 95% CI:
      0.31-3.39]. CONCLUSION: TNBC patients who underwent BCT showed non-inferior
      locoregional recurrence compared to non-TNBC patients with BCT. Thus, BCT is an
      acceptable surgical approach in patients with TNBC.

TI  - Failure patterns and survival outcomes in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC): a
      15 year comparison of 448 non-Hispanic black and white women.
PG  - 756
LID - 10.1186/s40064-016-2444-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a distinct subtype of breast
      cancer with unique pathologic, molecular and clinical behavior. It occurs more
      frequently in young blacks and has been reported to have a shorter disease-free
      interval. We undertook this study to analyze the demographic characteristics,
      failure patterns, and survival outcomes in this disease. METHODS: A total of 448 
      non-Hispanic black and white women were identified over a 15 year period from
      1996 to 2011. Demographic and clinical information including age, race,
      menopausal status, stage, tumor characteristics, and treatments were collected.
      Fisher's exact test and multivariable Cox regression were used to compare failure
      patterns and survival outcomes between races. RESULTS: 49 % (n = 223) were black.
      59 % patients were between 41 and 60 years, with 18 % </=40 years. 57 % were
      premenopausal and 89 % had grade 3 tumors. Stage II (47 %) was most frequent
      stage at diagnosis followed by stage III (28 %). 32 % had lymphovascular
      invasion. Adjusting for age, stage, and grade, there was no difference in
      survival outcomes (OS, DFS, LFFS, and DFFS) between the two races. 62 (14 %)
      patients failed locally either in ipsilateral breast or chest wall, and 19 (4 %) 
      failed in the regional lymphatics. Lung (18 %) was the most frequent distant
      failure site with <12 % each failing in brain, liver and bones. CONCLUSION:
      Failure patterns and survival outcomes did not differ by race in this large
      collection of TNBC cases. Lung was the predominate site of distant failure
      followed by brain, bone, and liver. Few patients failed in the regional
      lymphatics.

TI  - The length of the bridging chain in ansa-metallocenes influences their
      antiproliferative activity against triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC).
PG  - 13126-34
LID - 10.1039/c6dt01640e [doi]
AB  - In order to examine whether the length of the bridging chain in ansa-ferrocenes
      affects their antiproliferative activity against MDA-MB-231 triple negative
      breast cancer cell lines (TNBC), we synthesized derivatives of the type
      1-[bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)]methylidene-[n]ferrocenophane and
      1-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)-phenyl]methylidene-[n]ferrocenophane with n = 3, 4, 5. We
      found that the derivatives of [3]ferrocenophane, the compounds with the shortest 
      bridging chains, are the most active. IC50 values were 0.09 +/- 0.01, 2.41 +/-
      0.10, and 1.85 +/- 0.25 muM for the dihydroxyphenyl derivatives, with n = 3, 4,
      5, respectively. These differences can be explained in terms of modification of
      the key metabolites (radical versus quinone methides) within the ansa series
      depending on the length of the bridging chain. The derivative of
      [5]ferrocenophane, possessing two -[bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)]methylidene groups, was
      also prepared. Surprisingly, this relatively large molecule is also active (IC50 
      = 2.7 +/- 0.3 muM). Two ruthenocenophane analogs were also synthesized. These
      ruthenium compounds are practically inactive against MDA-MB-231 cells. The
      unusual chemistry of these different compounds is discussed in terms of
      elucidating the mechanism underlying their diverse antiproliferative activity,
      and their specific advantages are evaluated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of
      breast cancer with poor 5-year survival. Knowledge and information about IBC with
      the triple negative (TNBC) phenotype are limited. Here, we report the
      characteristics and outcome of inflammatory TNBC (I-TNBC) cancer cohorts from a
      large TNBC dataset. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After obtaining institutional review
      board approval, we collected information on 476 women with a diagnosis of TNBC
      from 1996 to 2011. Data on patient characteristics, tumor, and treatment were
      collected. Overall survival (OS) was computed from the date of diagnosis to the
      date of death or last follow-up. For disease-free survival (DFS), patients were
      scored if they failed. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.3.
      RESULTS: A total of 34 (7%) patients were diagnosed with inflammatory TNBC. The
      median age was 52 years, and 56% were white. The median follow-up was 13 months
      (interquartile range, 2-126 months). Twenty-one percent (n = 7) presented with
      stage IV disease, while 91% had axillary nodal involvement. All but 2 (94%; n =
      32) patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with 6% (n = 2) achieving complete
      response. Twenty-one (62%) patients underwent mastectomy; 71% (n = 24) received
      radiation. The 2- and 5-year OS and DFS were 34%, 26% (vs. 65%, 46%) and 27%, 23%
      (vs. 53%, 40%), respectively, for I-TNBC and non-inflammatory stage III-IV TNBC. 
      Compared with the non-inflammatory group, the 2- and 5-year OS (P < .0005) and
      DFS (P < .0073) were significantly inferior for I-TNBC. CONCLUSION: IBC with the 
      triple negative phenotype is an aggressive disease with a significantly inferior 
      outcome compared with non-inflammatory locally advanced TNBC. Newer strategies
      are required to improve survival outcome.

TI  - Outcomes of Triple-Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) Compared with Non-TNBC: Does
      the Survival Vary for All Stages?
PG  - 1362-72
LID - 10.1007/s00268-016-3422-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with aggressive
      tumor behavior and worse outcomes. In a study at a tertiary care breast unit in a
      developing country, clinico-pathological attributes and outcomes of patients with
      TNBC were compared with (c.w.) ER, PR, and/or HER2 expressing tumors (non-TNBC). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 1213 consecutive breast cancer patients 
      managed during 2004-2010 were reviewed. An evaluable cohort of 705 patients with 
      complete treatment and follow-up (median 36 months) information was thus
      identified. Patients were categorized per ER, PR & HER2 status into TNBC, and
      ER/PR+ and/or HER2+ groups. Clinico-pathological parameters, response to NACT,
      and OS & DFS were compared between TNBC and non-TNBC groups. RESULTS: TNBC
      patients (n = 249) comprised 35.3 % of the study cohort (n = 705), and were
      significantly younger than non-TNBC patients (mean age 49.1 +/- 11.2y c.w. 51.8
      +/- 11.3, p = 0.02). The TNM stage at presentation was similar in the two groups 
      (Stage I and II-37 % c.w. 44.3 %, Stage III-47.5 % c.w. 39.5 %, Stage IV-15.5 %
      c.w. 16.2 % in TNBC c.w. Non-TNBC; p = 0.09). Tumor size (5.7 +/- 2.9 cm TNBC
      c.w. 5.4 +/- 2.8 cm non-TNBC, p = 0.22) was similar but lymph nodal (cN)
      metastases were more frequent in TNBC (77.3 % c.w. 69.8 %; p = 0.03). TNBC had
      higher histologic grade (97.1 % gr II/III in TNBC c.w. 91.2 % non-TNBC, p = 0.01)
      and higher incidence of LVI (20.4 % in TNBC c.w. 13.5 %, p = 0.03). Patient
      groups received similar multi-disciplinary surgical, radiation, and systemic
      treatment. Comparable proportion of patients in 2 groups were treated with NACT
      (42 % c.w. 38 %), which resulted in pathological complete response (pCR) in 27.5 
      % TNBC patients c.w. 17.1 % non-TNBC patients (p = 0.04). Both OS (81.8 +/- 4.52 
      c.w. 97.90 +/- 3.87 months, p < 0.001) and DFS (89.2 +/- 5.1 c.w. 113.8 +/- 4.3
      months, p < 0.001) were shorter in TNBC than non-TNBC group. On stage-wise
      comparison, OS differed significantly only in stage III (47.4 +/- 5.3 months in
      TNBC c.w. 74.5 +/- 4.4 in non-TNBC; p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate
      analyses revealed tumor stage and IHC subtyping into TNBC c.w. non-TNBC as most
      important factors predictive of survival. CONCLUSIONS: TNBC occurred at younger
      age and exhibited aggressive pathology as compared to non-TNBC patients. Although
      patients with TNBC exhibited better chemo-sensitivity, they had worse DFS and OS 
      compared to the non-TNBC patients. The survival of Stage III TNBC patients was
      significantly worse compared to non-TNBC group; while in stages I, II, and IV,
      survival were not significantly different.

TI  - The fate of chemoresistance in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PG  - 257-75
LID - 10.1016/j.bbacli.2015.03.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment options for women presenting with triple negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) are limited due to the lack of a therapeutic target and as a
      result, are managed with standard chemotherapy such as paclitaxel (Taxol(R)).
      Following chemotherapy, the ideal tumour response is apoptotic cell death.
      Post-chemotherapy, cells can maintain viability by undergoing viable cellular
      responses such as cellular senescence, generating secretomes which can directly
      enhance the malignant phenotype. SCOPE OF REVIEW: How tumour cells retain
      viability in response to chemotherapeutic engagement is discussed. In addition we
      discuss the implications of this retained tumour cell viability in the context of
      the development of recurrent and metastatic TNBC disease. Current adjuvant and
      neo-adjuvant treatments available and the novel potential therapies that are
      being researched are also reviewed. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Cellular senescence and
      cytoprotective autophagy are potential mechanisms of chemoresistance in TNBC.
      These two non-apoptotic outcomes in response to chemotherapy are inextricably
      linked and are neglected outcomes of investigation in the chemotherapeutic arena.
      Cellular fate assessments may therefore have the potential to predict TNBC
      patient outcome. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Focusing on the fact that cancer cells can
      bypass the desired cellular apoptotic response to chemotherapy through cellular
      senescence and cytoprotective autophagy will highlight the importance of
      targeting non-apoptotic survival pathways to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Cabozantinib (XL184) Inhibits Growth and Invasion of Preclinical TNBC Models.
PG  - 923-34
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0187 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer
      subtype that is associated with poor clinical outcome. There is a vital need for 
      effective targeted therapeutics for TNBC patients, yet treatment strategies are
      challenged by the significant intertumoral heterogeneity within the TNBC subtype 
      and its surrounding microenvironment. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are highly 
      expressed in several TNBC subtypes and are promising therapeutic targets. In this
      study, we targeted the MET receptor, which is highly expressed across several
      TNBC subtypes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using the small-molecule inhibitor
      cabozantinib (XL184), we examined the efficacy of MET inhibition in preclinical
      models that recapitulate human TNBC and its microenvironment. To analyze the
      dynamic interactions between TNBC cells and fibroblasts over time, we utilized a 
      3D model referred to as MAME (Mammary Architecture and Microenvironment
      Engineering) with quantitative image analysis. To investigate cabozantinib
      inhibition in vivo, we used a novel xenograft model that expresses human HGF and 
      supports paracrine MET signaling. RESULTS: XL184 treatment of MAME cultures of
      MDA-MB-231 and HCC70 cells (+/- HGF-expressing fibroblasts) was cytotoxic and
      significantly reduced multicellular invasive outgrowths, even in cultures with
      HGF-expressing fibroblasts. Treatment with XL184 had no significant effects on
      MET(neg) breast cancer cell growth. In vivo assays demonstrated that cabozantinib
      treatment significantly inhibited TNBC growth and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Using 
      preclinical TNBC models that recapitulate the breast tumor microenvironment, we
      demonstrate that cabozantinib inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy in 
      several TNBC subtypes.

TI  - Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) improve prognosis in patients with triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PG  - e985930
AB  - Upon analysis of archived primary tumors of 482 patients with triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) enrolled in two randomized Phase III adjuvant chemotherapy
      trials, we have found that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), as assessed and
      quantified by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining are a robust and independent
      predictor of disease-free survival (DFS), distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI)
      and overall survival (OS).(1) Our findings provide confirmation of results
      observed in TNBC in a European adjuvant chemotherapy dataset and therefore
      elevate TILs as prognostic biomarker for operable TNBC to level I evidence.

AB  - Despite the promise of targeted therapies, there remains an urgent need for
      effective treatment for esophageal cancer (EC) and triple-negative breast cancer 
      (TNBC). Current FDA-approved drugs have significant problems of toxicity, safety,
      selectivity, efficacy and development of resistance. In this manuscript, we
      demonstrate that rationally designed peptide vaccines/mimics are a viable
      therapeutic strategy for blocking aberrant molecular signaling pathways with high
      affinity, specificity, potency and safety. Specifically, we postulate that novel 
      combination treatments targeting members of the EGFR family and IGF-1R will yield
      significant anti-tumor effects in in vitro models of EC and TNBC possibly
      overcoming mechanisms of resistance. We show that the combination of HER-1 and
      HER-2 or HER-1 and IGF-1R peptide mimics/vaccine antibodies exhibited enhanced
      antitumor properties with significant inhibition of tumorigenesis in OE19 EC and 
      MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines. Our work elucidates the mechanisms of HER-1/IGF-1R
      and HER-1/HER-2 signaling in these cancer cell lines, and the promising results
      support the rationale for dual targeting with HER-1 and HER-2 or IGF-1R as an
      improved treatment regimen for advanced therapy tailored to difference types of
      cancer.

AB  - To date, there is no available targeted therapy for patients who are diagnosed
      with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The aim of this study was to identify
      a new specific target for specific treatments. Frozen primary tumors were
      collected from 83 adjuvant therapy-naive TNBC patients. These samples were used
      for global proteome profiling by iTRAQ-OFFGEL-LC-MS/MS approach in two series: a 
      training cohort (n = 42) and a test set (n = 41). Patients who remains free of
      local or distant metastasis for a minimum of 5 years after surgery were
      classified in the no-relapse group; the others were in the relapse group. OPLS
      and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to select candidate markers, which were 
      validated by immunohistochemistry. Three proteins were identified in the training
      set and validated in the test set by Kaplan-Meier method and immunohistochemistry
      (IHC): TrpRS as a good prognostic markers and DP and TSP1 as bad prognostic
      markers. We propose the establishment of an IHC test to calculate the score of
      TrpRS, DP, and TSP1 in TNBC tumors to evaluate the degree of aggressiveness of
      the tumors. Finally, we propose that DP and TSP1 could provide therapeutic
      targets for specific treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease without
      established targeted treatment options for patients with metastatic disease. This
      study was undertaken to evaluate potentially actionable biomarkers in a large
      cohort of TNBC and compare them with non-TNBCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      evaluated 6341 (2111 TNBC and 4230 non-TNBC) breast cancer samples at a central
      laboratory for biomarkers of potential drug response across multiple platforms,
      including gene sequencing, protein expression, and gene copy number. RESULTS:
      TNBC expresses androgen receptor (AR) in a significantly (P < .05) lower
      percentage of cases (17%) than hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast carcinomas (59% and 79%,
      respectively), and gene comutations were differentially associated with
      AR-positive versus AR-negative cases. Higher AR expression levels in TNBC
      predicted for lower Ki-67 levels. Seventy percent of TNBC harbored a
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA),
      v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), or phosophatase and tensin 
      homolog (PTEN) aberration. TNBC patients had a significantly lower PIK3CA
      mutation rate (13%) than all other subtypes (P < .05) and a higher tumor protein 
      p53 (TP53) mutation rate (64%) than the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cases
      (approximately 30%; P < .05). Topoisomerase 2 (TOP2A) amplification was observed 
      in 1.3% of TNBC and in 1.6% of HER2-negative, HR-positive cancers; in contrast,
      HER2-positive, HR-negative or HR-positive cancers exhibited TOP2A amplification
      in 19% and 40% of cases, respectively (P <.05). CONCLUSION: Multi-platform
      molecular profiling identifies subgroups of TNBC with different biomarker
      profiles, suggesting numerous potentially targetable alterations in TNBC. TNBC is
      further characterized by different gene mutations and proliferative activity
      relative to AR expression, highlighting a need for comprehensive pathologic
      examination with potential to develop different, individualized treatment
      options.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TNBC is an aggressive subset of breast cancer (BC) without specific
      target therapy. METHODS: This observational, retrospective study included 45
      cases of TNBC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of the AR,
      E-cadherin and Ki-67 in relation to histological type, time to relapse and
      overall survival (OS). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out on
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples obtained from patients defined
      TNBC. RESULTS: The AR was positive (IHC >10%) in 26.6%. E-cadherin (CDH1)
      expression was considered positive if the score was >/= 2. This expression was
      negative in 53.3% cases. The Ki-67 index was >/= 20% in 37.7%. Univariate
      analyses showed that AR, CDH1 and Ki-67 are significantly associated with OS.
      Multivariate analysis showed that AR and Ki-67 expression are independent
      variables associated with OS. The statistical analysis showed that patients with 
      AR negative and Ki-67 positive expression have a significant correlation with
      poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the combination of AR and
      E-cadherin expression as well as Ki-67 status might be useful prognostic markers 
      in TNBC. Hence, these molecular determinants could play an interesting role to
      classify subgroups of TNBC.

TI  - MiR-27a modulates radiosensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells 
      by targeting CDC27.
PG  - 1297-303
LID - 10.12659/MSM.893974 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MiR-27a is significantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC). However, the exact biological function of MiR-27a in TNBC is not
      fully understood. In this study, we verified miR-27a expression in TNBC cells and
      explored how its overexpression modulates radiosensitivity of the cells.
      MATERIAL/METHODS: qRT-PCR analysis was performed to study miR-27a expression in
      TNBC lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and in normal human breast epithelial cell
      line MCF10A. Dual luciferase assay was performed to verify a putative downstream 
      target of miR-27a, CDC27. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the influence of
      miR-27a-CDC27 axis on cell proliferation under irradiation (IR) treatment.
      RESULTS: We confirmed significantly higher miR-27a expression in 2 TNBC cell
      lines--MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231--than in human breast epithelial cell line
      MCF10A. miR-27a could modulate proliferation and radiosensitivity of TNBC cells. 
      CDC-27 is a direct target of miR-27a and its downregulation conferred increased
      radioresistance of the cells. CONCLUSIONS: The miR-27a-CDC27 axis might play an
      important role in modulating response to radiotherapy in TNBC cells. Testing
      miR-27a expression might be a useful way to identify a subgroup of patients who
      will benefit from an IR-based therapeutic approach.

TI  - Antimetastatic Therapies of the Polysulfide Diallyl Trisulfide against
      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) via Suppressing MMP2/9 by Blocking NF-kappaB
      and ERK/MAPK Signaling Pathways.
PG  - e0123781
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0123781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migration and invasion are two crucial steps of tumor metastasis.
      Blockage of these steps may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk. The
      objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of diallyl
      trisulfide (DATS), a natural organosulfuric compound with most sulfur atoms found
      in garlic, on migration and invasion in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DATS were
      further investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 cells and HS 578t breast
      cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of DATS. DATS obviously
      suppressed the migration and invasion of two cell lines and changed the
      morphological. Moreover, DATS inhibited the mRNA/protein/ enzymes activities of
      MMP2/9 via attenuating the NF-kappaB pathway. DATS also inhibited ERK/MAPK rather
      than p38 and JNK. CONCLUSION: DATS inhibits MMP2/9 activity and the metastasis of
      TNBC cells, and emerges as a potential anti-cancer agent. The inhibitory effects 
      are associated with down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of
      NF-kappaB and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways.

TI  - The pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 activates canonical WNT signaling to confer
      resistance in TNBC cells: resistance reversal with WNT inhibitor.
PG  - 11061-73
AB  - The pan-PI3K inhibitors are one treatment option for triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC). However, this treatment is ineffective for unknown reasons. Here, 
      we report that aberrant expression of wingless-type MMTV integration site family 
      (WNT) and activated WNT signals, which crosstalk with the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
      pathway through GSK3beta, plays the most critical role in resistance to pan-PI3K 
      inhibitors in TNBC cells. GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor that activates the
      WNT/beta-catenin pathway in TNBC cells through stimulation of WNT secretion.
      GDC-0941-triggered WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation was observed in MDA-MB-231
      and HCC1937 cells, which are TNBC cell lines showing aberrant WNT/beta-catenin
      activation, and not in SKBR3 and MCF7 cells. This observation is further
      investigated in vivo. GDC-0941 exhibited minimal tumor inhibition in MDA-MB-231
      cells, but it significantly suppressed tumor growth in HER-positive SK-BR3 cells.
      In vivo mechanism study revealed the activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway by
      GDC-0941. A synergistic effect was observed when combined treatment with GDC-0941
      and the WNT inhibitor LGK974 at low concentrations in MDA-MB-231 cells. These
      findings indicated that WNT pathway activation conferred resistance in TNBC cells
      treated with GDC-0941. This resistance may be further circumvented through
      combined treatment with pan-PI3K and WNT inhibitors. Future clinical trials of
      these two inhibitors are warranted.

AB  - Phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA-15) is known to sequester
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytoplasm, inhibiting
      tumorigenesis of human breast cancer cells. Here, we describe how PEA-15
      expression affects the dephosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contacts in
      MDA-MB-468, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The increased
      intracellular calcium concentration resulting from increased cytoplasmic
      phosphorylated ERK facilitates movement of ER-anchored calcium sensors to the PM.
      The driving force of trans-localization of calcium-dependent proteins enhances
      the contact between the activated EGFR and ER-localized phosphatase, PTP1B.
      Consequently, our findings suggest a mechanism underneath the facilitation of
      EGFR dephosphorylation by cytoplasmic PEA-15 expression inside TNBC cells, which 
      may be one of the dynamic mechanisms for down-regulation of activated EGFR in
      cancer cells.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are highly aggressive cancers 
      that lack targeted therapies. However, EGFR is frequently activated in a subset
      of TNBCs and represents a viable clinical target. Because the endocytic adaptor
      protein Endophilin A2 (SH3GL1/Endo II) has been implicated in EGFR
      internalization, we investigated Endo II expression and function in human TNBCs. 
      Endo II expression was high in several TNBC cells compared with normal breast
      epithelial cells. Stable knockdown (KD) of Endo II was achieved in two TNBC cell 
      lines, and although cell viability was unaffected, defects in receptor-mediated
      endocytosis were observed. EGFR signaling to Erk and Akt kinases was impaired in 
      Endo II KD cells, and this correlated with reduced rates of EGFR internalization 
      and cell motility. Endo II KD cells also displayed defects in three dimensional
      (3D) cell invasion, and this correlated with impaired extracellular matrix
      degradation and internalization of MT1-MMP. Endo II silencing also caused a
      significant reduction in TNBC tumor growth and lung metastasis in mammary
      orthotopic tumor xenograft assays. In human breast tumor specimens, Endo II
      expression was highest in TNBC tumors compared with other subtypes, and at the
      level of gene expression, high Endo II was associated with reduced relapse-free
      survival in patients with basal-like breast cancers. Together, these results
      identify a positive role for Endo II in TNBC tumor metastasis and a potential
      link with poor prognosis. IMPLICATIONS: Endophilin A2 and related adaptor
      proteins represent important signaling hubs to target in metastatic cancers.

TI  - Overexpression of CD85j in TNBC patients inhibits Cetuximab-mediated NK-cell ADCC
      but can be restored with CD85j functional blockade.
PG  - 1560-9
LID - 10.1002/eji.201445353 [doi]
AB  - Clinical studies suggest that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with 
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing tumors could benefit from
      therapy with Cetuximab, which targets EGFR. NK cells are the primary effectors of
      antibody (Ab)-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and thus play a role in
      Ab-based therapies. We have previously described diminished levels of
      Cetuximab-mediated ADCC in vitro in patients with advanced breast cancer. Here,
      we investigated the potential causes of this NK-cell functional deficiency. We
      characterized NK-cell activating/inhibitory receptors in the peripheral blood of 
      breast cancer patients and found CD85j inhibitory receptor overexpression. The
      capacity of NK cells to perform Cetuximab-triggered ADCC against TNBC cells
      correlated inversely with CD85j expression, even in the presence of the
      stimulatory cytokines IL-2 or IL-15. Hence, patients expressing high levels of
      CD85j had an impaired ability to lyse TNBC cells in the presence of Cetuximab. We
      also found that CD85j overexpression was associated with HLA-I and soluble HLA-G 
      expression by tumors. A CD85j functional blockade with a CD85j antagonist Ab
      restored ADCC levels in breast cancer patients and reverted this negative effect.
      Our data suggest that strategies that overcome the hurdles of immune activation
      could improve Cetuximab clinical efficacy.

TI  - Limited family structure and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype as
      predictors of BRCA mutations in a genetic counseling cohort of early-onset
      sporadic breast cancers.
PG  - 415-21
LID - 10.1007/s10549-014-3167-4 [doi]
AB  - Early-onset diagnosis is an eligibility criterion for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA)
      testing in sporadic breast cancer patients. Limited family structure has been
      proposed as a predictor of BRCA mutation status in this group of patients. An
      overwhelming amount of data supports a strong association between BRCA1 mutations
      and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we analyze the feasibility of
      using limited family structure and TNBC as predictors of BRCA mutation status in 
      early-onset breast cancer patients attending genetic counseling units. We have
      conducted the study in a cohort of sporadic early-onset (</=35 years) breast
      cancer patients (N = 341) previously selected for BRCA genetic testing in
      Academic Hereditary Cancer Clinics from Spain. A retrospective review of medical 
      records available at the time of risk assessment allowed us classifying patients 
      according to family structure and TNBC. In addition, BRCAPRO score was calculated
      for all patients. Association between categorical variables was investigated
      using the Fisher's exact test. Binary Logistic Regression Analysis was used for
      multivariate analysis. Limited family structure (OR 3.61, p = 0.013) and TNBC (OR
      3.14, p = 0.013) were independent predictors of BRCA mutation status. Mutation
      prevalence in the subgroup of patients with at least one positive predictor was
      14%, whereas it dropped to 3% in non-TNBCs with adequate family history (OR 5.31,
      95% CI 1.38-23.89, p = 0.006). BRCAPRO correctly discerned between limited and
      adequate family structures. Limited family structure and TNBC are feasible
      predictors of BRCA mutation status in sporadic early-onset (</=35 years) breast
      cancer patients attending genetic counseling units. The low prevalence of
      mutations observed in non-TNBCs with adequate family structure suggests that this
      subgroup of patients might be excluded from genetic testing.

TI  - Insulin activates EGFR by stimulating its interaction with IGF-1R in

AB  - The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important
      diagnostic marker for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which lack
      three hormonal receptors: estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2. EGFR transactivation can cause drug
      resistance in many cancers including TNBC, but the mechanism underlying this
      phenomenon is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that insulin treatment induces
      EGFR activation by stimulating the interaction of EGFR with insulin-like growth
      factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) in the MDA-MB-436 TNBC cell line. These cells express 
      low levels of EGFR, while exhibiting high levels of IGF-1R expression and
      phosphorylation. Low-EGFRexpressing MDA-MB-436 cells show high sensitivity to
      insulinstimulated cell growth. Therefore, unexpectedly, insulin stimulation
      induced EGFR transactivation by regulating its interaction with IGF-1R in
      low-EGFR-expressing TNBC cells.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancers express receptors for gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone (GnRH) in more than 50% of the cases, which can be targeted with peptidic
      analogs of GnRH, such as triptorelin. The current study investigates cytotoxic
      activity of triptorelin as a monotherapy and in treatment combinations with
      chemotherapeutic agents and inhibitors of the PI3K and the ERK pathways in in
      vitro models of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). GnRH receptor expression
      of TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 was investigated. Cells were treated
      with triptorelin, chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, docetaxel, AEZS-112),
      PI3K/AKT inhibitors (perifosine, AEZS-129), an ERK inhibitor (AEZS-134), and dual
      PI3K/ERK inhibitor AEZS-136 applied as single agent therapies and in
      combinations. MDA-MB-231 and HCC1806 TNBC cells both expressed receptors for GnRH
      on messenger (m)RNA and protein level and were found sensitive to triptorelin
      with a respective median effective concentration (EC50) of 31.21 +/- 0.21 and
      58.50 +/- 19.50. Synergistic effects occurred when triptorelin was combined with 
      cisplatin. In HCC1806 cells, synergy occurred when triptorelin was applied with
      PI3K/AKT inhibitors perifosine and AEZS-129. In MDA-MB-231 cells, synergy was
      observed after co-treatment with triptorelin and ERK inhibitor AEZS-134 and dual 
      PI3K/ERK inhibitor AEZS-136. GnRH receptors on TNBC cells can be used for
      targeted therapy of these cancers with GnRH agonist triptorelin. Treatment
      combinations based on triptorelin and PI3K and ERK inhibitors and
      chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin have synergistic effects in in vitro models of
      TNBC. If confirmed in vivo, clinical trials based on triptorelin and cisplatin
      could be quickly carried out, as triptorelin is FDA approved for other
      indications and known to be well tolerated.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one type of breast cancer (BC), which is 
      defined as negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
      human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2). Its origins and development seem
      to be elusive. And for now, drugs like tamoxifen or trastuzumab which
      specifically apply to ER, PR or Her2 positive BC seem unforeseeable in TNBC
      clinical treatment. Due to its extreme malignancy, high recurrence rate and poor 
      prognosis, a lot of work on the research of TNBC is needed. This review aims to
      summarize the latest findings in TNBC in risk factors, possible therapeutic
      targets and possible prognostic makers.

TI  - Development of human serine protease-based therapeutics targeting Fn14 and
      identification of Fn14 as a new target overexpressed in TNBC.
PG  - 2688-705
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0346 [doi]
AB  - The cytokine TWEAK and its receptor, Fn14, have emerged as potentially valuable
      targets for cancer therapy. Granzyme B (GrB)-containing Fn14-targeted constructs 
      were generated containing either the Fn14 ligand TWEAK (GrB-TWEAK) or an
      anti-Fn14 humanized single-chain antibody (GrB-Fc-IT4) as the targeting moieties.
      Both constructs showed high affinity and selective cytotoxicity against a panel
      of Fn14-expressing human tumor cells including triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) lines. Cellular expression of the GrB inhibitor PI-9 in target cells had
      no impact on the cytotoxic effect of either construct. Cellular expression of
      MDR1 showed no cross-resistance to the fusion constructs. GrB-TWEAK and
      GrB-Fc-IT4 activated intracellular caspase cascades and cytochrome c-related
      proapoptotic pathways consistent with the known intracellular functions of GrB in
      target cells. Treatment of mice bearing established HT-29 xenografts with
      GrB-TWEAK showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared with vehicle alone 
      (P < 0.05). Both GrB-TWEAK and GrB-Fc-IT4 displayed significant tumor growth
      inhibition when administered to mice bearing orthotopic MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) tumor
      xenografts. The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis revealed that Fn14 mRNA expression
      was significantly higher in TNBC and in HER2-positive disease (P < 0.0001)
      compared with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, and in basal-like 2 tumors
      (P = 0.01) compared with other TNBC molecular subtypes. IHC analysis of a 101
      patient TNBC tumor microarray showed that 55 of 101 (54%) of tumors stained
      positive for Fn14, suggesting that this may be an excellent potential target for 
      precision therapeutic approaches. Targeting Fn14 using fully human,
      GrB-containing fusion constructs may form the basis for a new class of novel,
      potent, and highly effective constructs for targeted therapeutic applications.

AB  - The mechanism underlying the aggressive behaviors of triple negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) is not well characterized yet. The association between cancer stem 
      cell (CSC) population and the aggressive behaviors of TNBC has not been
      established. We found the CD44(+)/CD24(-) cell population was enriched in TNBC
      tissues and cell lines, with a higher capacity of proliferation, migration,
      invasion and tumorigenicity as well as lower adhesion ability. The
      CD44(+)/CD24(-) cell population with cancer stem cell-like properties may play an
      important role in the aggressive behaviors of TNBC. This discovery may lead to
      new therapeutic strategies targeting CD44(+)/CD24(-) cell population in TNBC.

TI  - TNBC vs non-TNBC: A retrospective review of differences in mean age, family
      history, smoking history, and stage at diagnosis.
PG  - 377-81
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare mean age, ethnicity, smoking history,
      family history of breast cancer, and stage at diagnosis in patients with
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) vs non-TNBC at an inner city university
      program. METHODS: We reviewed data in our tumor registry on patients seen between
      January 2000 and December 2005, and identified a total of 445 patients with
      various subtypes of breast cancers. Of these, 342 patients met our study
      criteria. Thirty-nine patients had TNBC and 303 had non-TNBC. RESULTS: The mean
      age at diagnosis was 59.87 +/- 15.67 years for TNBC and 60.09 +/- 13.98 years for
      non-TNBC (P=.9272). TNBC was more common in black than in white patients (58.97% 
      vs 35.90%; OR, 2.755; P=.004), and non-TNBC was more common in white than in
      black patients (57.76% vs 39.27%). There was not a statistically significant
      difference in past or present smoking between the TNBC and non-TNBC patients
      (20.51% vs 27.72%; P=.4385). Family history of breast cancer was not
      statistically related to TNBC status: a positive family history was reported in
      30.77% of TNBC patients vs 33.33% of non-TNBC patients (P=.8384), no family
      history was reported in 51.28% of TNBC patients vs 51.82% of non-TNBC patients,
      and family history was unknown in 17.95% of TNBC patients vs 14.85% of non-TNBC
      patients. Pathologic stage at the time of diagnosis was as follows for TNBC vs
      non-TNBC patients: stage 0, 15.79% vs 11.37% (P=.4332); stage I, 34.21% vs 30.98%
      (P=.6890); stage II, 28.98% vs 37.25% (P=.3205); stage III, 18.42% vs 17.25%
      (P=.8591); and stage IV, 3.63% vs 3.14% (P=.8651). CONCLUSION: We found that in
      our patient population, black women were significantly more likely to have TNBC
      than non-TNBC, and white women were more likely to have non-TNBC than TNBC.

TI  - Should triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype affect local-regional therapy
      decision making?
PG  - e32-6
LID - 10.14694/EdBook_AM.2014.34.e32 [doi]
AB  - The more aggressive biologic characteristics and the current lack of targeted
      therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) make local-regional management
      decisions challenging for physicians. TNBC is associated with patients of younger
      age, black race and BRCA1 mutation carriers. Distinctions between
      BRCA1-associated and sporadic TNBC include increased lifetime risk of ipsilateral
      and contralateral breast cancer after breast cancer therapy (BCT) for BRCA
      carriers, which is not shared by sporadic TNBC. However, the presence of a BRCA
      mutation should not preclude a breast-conservation approach in patients who are
      otherwise appropriate candidates for BCT. Data suggest that local-regional
      relapse (LRR) at baseline after BCT appears to be comparable for TNBC and the
      HER2-positive subgroups, but is about 50% greater than luminal tumors. LRR
      appears to be similarly increased after mastectomy; thus, TNBC should not be a
      contra-indication for BCT. Recent hypothesis-generating data suggest less LRR
      after BCT (where radiation is routinely delivered) than with mastectomy for
      early-stage TNBC. To date, no specific local-regional guideline recommendations
      for TNBC exist. Level I outcome data for TNBC using accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (APBI) and hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (hWBRT) are
      lacking. TNBC should be treated with APBI only on clinical trials. Although hWBRT
      may be considered in TNBC, its association with younger age, advanced disease and
      use of systemic chemotherapy often precludes its use for this subtype. Until
      definitive treatment strategies are validated in large datasets and confirmed in 
      randomized trials, TNBC subtype, in and of itself, should not direct
      local-regional management treatment decisions.

TI  - A randomized controlled phase II trial of a novel composition of paclitaxel
      embedded into neutral and cationic lipids targeting tumor endothelial cells in
      advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PG  - 824-31

AB  - BACKGROUND: EndoTAG-1, composed of paclitaxel embedded in liposomal membranes
      targeting tumor endothelial cells, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in
      advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred 
      and forty patients were treated with weekly EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m(2)) plus
      paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2)), twice weekly EndoTAG-1 (2x 44 mg/m(2)), or weekly
      paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) for greater than or equal to four cycles (3-week
      treatment + 1-week rest) or until progression/toxicity. Primary end point was
      progression-free survival (PFS) rate evaluated centrally after four cycles of
      therapy (week 16). The study was not powered for intergroup comparisons. RESULTS:
      The PFS rate at week 16 was 59.1% [one-sided 95% CI: 45.6, infinity] on
      combination treatment, 34.2% [21.6, infinity] on EndoTAG-1, and 48.0% [30.5,
      infinity] on paclitaxel. Median PFS reached 4.2, 3.4, and 3.7 months,
      respectively. After complete treatment (week 41 analysis), median overall
      survival (OS) was 13.0, 11.9, and 13.1 months for the modified Intention-to-Treat
      (ITT) population and 15.1, 12.5, and 8.9 months for the per-protocol population, 
      respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 53%, 31%, and 36% for the treatment
      groups. Safety analysis revealed known toxicities of the drugs with slight
      increases of grade 3/4 neutropenia on combination therapy. CONCLUSION: Treatment 
      of advanced TNBC with a combination of EndoTAG-1 and standard paclitaxel
      [Taxol(R) (Bristol-Myers Squibb GmbH), or equivalent generic formulation] was
      well tolerated and showed antitumor efficacy. The positive trend needs to be
      confirmed in a randomized phase III trial. STUDY REGISTRATION: European Clinical

TI  - TNBC vs. Non-TNBC: A Five-Year Retrospective Review of Differences in Mean Age,
      Family History, Smoking History and Stage at Diagnosis at an Inner City
      University Program.
PG  - 241-247

AB  - Background: In recent years, breast cancer has been classified on the basis of
      estrogen or progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status and whether the human epidermal 
      growth factor 2 receptor (HER2/neu) protein is overexpressed. Based on this
      system, breast cancer is broadly divided into the triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) and the non-TNBC subtypes. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer, notable for
      its propensity to metastasize early and display a comparatively more aggressive
      course than its non-TNBC counterpart. Certain clinico-pathologic and demographic 
      risk factors have been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we aim to
      compare mean age, ethnicity, family history, tobacco use and stage at
      presentation between TNBC and non-TNBC subtypes at our inner city university
      program. Methods: We reviewed data in our tumor registry between January 2000 and
      December 2005 with particular attention to mean age, race, family history,
      tobacco use and stage at presentation. We found a total of 445 patients with
      various subtypes of breast cancers. We included only those patients in whom the
      status of both ER/PR and the status of Her2/neu protein overexpression were
      recorded. Our strict selection criteria lead to an exclusion of about 103
      patients. Out of the remaining 342 patients, 39 were TNBC and 303 were non-TNBC. 
      Results: Mean age of onset for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients was 59.87 +/- 15.67
      years vs. 60.09 +/- 13.98 years respectively (P = 0.9272). In terms of ethnicity,
      TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients had the following racial backgrounds: black, 58.97%
      vs. 39.27%; white, 35.90% vs. 57.76%; Chinese, 2.56% vs. 0.99%; others, 2.57% vs.
      1.98% respectively (P = 0.004, OR = 2.755). Comparisons with respect to a history
      of tobacco abuse for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients revealed a positive smoking
      history in 20.51% vs. 27.72% whereas there was no former or current smoking
      history in 71.79% vs. 61.72% respectively (P = 0.4385). Comparison of family
      history of a breast cancer in TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients showed that positive
      family history of breast cancer was seen in 30.77% vs. 33.33%, no family history 
      of cancer was seen in 51.28% vs. 51.82% and unknown 17.95% vs. 14.85% (P =
      0.8384). Pathologic stage at the time of diagnosis for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients
      was as follows: stage 0, 15.79% vs. 11.37% (P = 0.4332); stage 1, 34.21% vs.
      30.98% (P = 0.6890); stage 2, 28.98% vs. 37.25% (P = 0.3205); stage 3, 18.42% vs.
      17.25% (P = 0.0.8591); and stage 4, 3.63% vs. 3.14% (P = 0.8651). Analysis using 
      Chi-square test revealed chi(2) value of 0.855. Conclusion: Our results add to
      the growing body of evidence pertaining to the association of certain demographic
      and clinico-pathologic characteristics in women with breast cancer. We found that
      in our patient population, there is a significant ethnic predisposition for the
      two types of breast cancers that we studied. African Americans were more likely
      to have TNBC compared to the higher frequency of non-TNBC in white females. We
      did not find a significant difference in mean age, cigarette smoking, family
      history and stage at diagnosis between the TNBC and non-TNBC breast cancer
      patients. These findings are all consistent with the previously published
      research studies.

TI  - Prognostic value of survivin and EGFR protein expression in triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) patients.
PG  - 349-57
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particular type of breast cancer which 
      is characterized by its biological aggressiveness, worse prognosis, and lack of
      prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in contrast with hormonal
      receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+)
      breast cancers. We aimed to evaluate survivin and epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) expression and their prognostic value and determine their
      relationships with the clinicopathological parameters of TNBC. A total of 136
      patients who had undergone a resection of primary TNBC were enrolled at the Third
      Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from March 2003 to September
      2005. Expression of ER, PR, HER2, EGFR, and survivin was assessed by
      immunohistochemistry. The association of TNBC and other clinicopathological
      variables and the prognostic value of survivin and EGFR expression were
      evaluated. Survivin was expressed in 62 (45.6 %) cases and EGFR was expressed in 
      82 (60.3 %) cases. Survivin expression was associated with menopausal status (P =
      0.011), tumor size (P = 0.037), and lymph node status (P = 0.001). EGFR
      expression was associated with menopausal status (P = 0.029), lymph node status
      (P = 0.004), P53 expression (P = 0.001), Ki-67 expression (P = 0.028), and
      lymphatic vascular invasion (P = 0.037). A multivariate analysis demonstrated
      that tumor size (hazard ratio (HR) 1.587, 95 % confidence interval (CI)
      1.081-2.330, P = 0.018 for disease-free survival (DFS); HR 1.606, 95%CI

      OS) were of prognostic significance for disease-free and overall survival. We
      draw a conclusion from the present study that survivin and EGFR expression are
      useful prognostic markers of TNBC and might be useful for molecular targeting
      therapy of TNBC treatment.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of BRCA1 gene
      aberrations in sporadic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and its impact on
      anthracycline-based therapy. BRCA1 promoter methylation was analyzed in 70 TNBC
      and compared with the clinical and pathologic characteristics. As a control
      group, we used 70 patients with non-TNBC. BRCA1 promoter methylation was observed
      in 65.2 % of patients and was similar in both groups. BRCA1 promoter methylation 
      was associated with decreased intensity of BRCA1 protein expression (P = 0.002)
      and significant increase of median disease-free survival (DFS) of TNBC patients
      receiving adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy (P = 0.001). Multivariate
      analysis revealed that BRCA1 promoter methylation remains a favorable factor in
      regard to DFS (HR 0.224; 95 % CI 0.092-0.546, P = 0.001) in TNBC after adjustment
      for other prognostic factors. In contrast, in non-TNBC, BRCA1 promoter
      methylation was not associated with any clinical and pathologic parameters. BRCA1
      promoter methylation is a common mechanism of BRCA1 gene aberration in sporadic
      breast cancer and is predictive for better response to anthracycline-based
      therapies.

TI  - Feline mammary basal-like adenocarcinomas: a potential model for human
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with basal-like subtype.
PG  - 403
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-13-403 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths.
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an immunophenotype defined by the absence
      of immunolabeling for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2
      protein, has a highly aggressive behavior. A subpopulation of TNBCs exhibit a
      basal-like morphology with immunohistochemical positivity for cytokeratins 5/6
      (CK5/6) and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and have a high incidence
      of BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility) mutations. Feline mammary adenocarcinomas 
      (FMAs) are highly malignant and share a similar basal-like subtype. The purpose
      of this study was to classify FMAs according to the current human classification 
      of breast cancer that includes evaluation of ER, PR and HER2 status and
      expression of basal CK 5/6 and EGFR. Furthermore, we selected triple negative,
      basal-like FMAs to screen for BRCA mutations similar to those described in human 
      TNBC. METHODS: Twenty four FMAs were classified according to the current human
      histologic breast cancer classification including immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 
      ER, PR HER2, CK5/6 and EGFR. Genetic alteration and loss of heterozygosity of
      BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were analyzed in triple negative, basal-like FMAs. RESULTS:
      IHC for ER, PR and HER2 identified 14 of the 24 (58%) FMAs as a triple negative. 
      Furthermore, 11 of these 14 (79%) triple negative FMAs had a basal-like subtype. 
      However, no genetic abnormalities were detected in BRCA1 and BRCA2 by direct
      sequencing and loss of heterozygosity analysis. CONCLUSION: FMAs are highly
      aggressive neoplasms that are commonly triple negative and exhibit a basal-like
      morphology. This is similar to human TNBC that are also commonly classified as a 
      basal-like subtype. While sequencing of a select number of triple negative,
      basal-like FMAs and testing for loss of heterozygosity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 did not
      identify mutations similar to those described in human TNBC, further in-depth
      evaluation is required to elucidate a potential role of BRCA in the tumorigenesis
      of triple negative, basal-like FMAs. The strong similarities in clinical
      behavior, morphology and IHC phenotype suggest that triple negative, basal-like
      FMAs may be a suitable spontaneous animal model for studying novel therapeutic
      approaches against human basal-like TNBC.

      cancer (TNBC).
PG  - 280-4
LID - 10.1007/s12094-013-1070-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: BRCA1-associated breast cancers have been associated to a
      triple-negative phenotype. The prevalence of BRCA1 germline mutations in young
      onset TNBC based on informativeness of family history has not been reported.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2008 to May 2009 were collected blood and
      tumor samples from patients with TNBC younger than 50 years and without a family 
      history of breast and ovarian cancer in first- and second-degree relatives.
      Analysis of BRCA1 germline mutations was made. Age at diagnosis and
      informativeness of family history (presence of female in first- and second-degree
      relatives alive until age 45) was collected in all cases. Immunohistochemistry of
      basal-like features was performed centrally in all available tumors. RESULTS:
      Seven pathogenic mutations were detected in 92 patients (7.6 %), two of them in
      patients younger than 35 years (28.6 %) (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.631). Three
      non-classified variants were detected (3.2 %). Family history was informative in 
      two patients with a pathogenic mutation (28.6 %) and not informative in five
      (71.4 %) (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.121). Of the seven patients with a
      pathogenic mutation, four had a basal-like phenotype. CONCLUSION: Patients with
      apparently sporadic TNBC younger than 50 years and a non-informative family
      history are candidates for germline genetic testing of BRCA1.

TI  - Prevalence of BRCA mutations among women with triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) in a genetic counseling cohort.
PG  - 3254-8
LID - 10.1245/s10434-013-3205-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Revised NCCN guidelines recommend that women </=60 years with
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) be referred for consideration of genetic
      counseling. Small, homogeneous samples have limited evaluation of BRCA mutation
      prevalence among different ethnicities affected by TNBC subtype. We sought to
      determine whether the prevalence of BRCA mutations within a TNBC cohort differs
      by demographic factors. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients 
      with TNBC referred for genetic counseling at two academic Hereditary Cancer
      Clinics between 2000 and 2012. Demographic data were collected, including age at 
      diagnosis and race/ethnicity. Race was categorized as African American (AA),
      Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ), Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, or other. Primary outcome was 
      BRCA mutation status, analyzed by race/ethnicity and age at diagnosis. RESULTS: A
      total of 469 patients with TNBC who underwent testing for BRCA genetic mutations 
      were identified, of which 450 patients had evaluable BRCA testing results; 139
      (30.8 %) had confirmed BRCA1 (n = 106) or BRCA2 (n = 32) mutations. BRCA mutation
      prevalence differed by ethnicity and race: AA (20.4 %), AJ (50 %), Asian (28.5
      %), Caucasian (33.3 %), and Hispanic (20 %). The prevalence of genetic mutations 
      also differed by age at diagnosis: <40 years (43.8 %), 40-49 years (27.4 %),
      50-59 years (25.3 %), 60-69 years (12.5 %), and >70 years (16.6 %). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The prevalence of genetic mutations among women with TNBC referred for genetic
      counseling is high and differs significantly by ethnicity/race and age. This data
      helps to refine mutation risk estimates among women with TNBC, allowing for more 
      personalized genetic counseling potentially aiding in improved patient
      decision-making.

AB  - Primary TNBCs are treated as if they were a single disease entity, yet it is
      clear they do not behave as a single entity in response to current therapies.
      Recently, we reported that statins might have a potential benefit for TNBCs
      associated with ets-1 overexpression. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      role of PTEN loss in the effects of statin on TNBC cells. In addition, we analyze
      the relationship between AKT downstream pathways and the effects of statin on
      TNBC cells. We investigated the effect of a statin on TNBC cells and analyzed the
      association of PI3K pathways using various TNBC cells in terms of PTEN loss and
      AKT pathways. Simvastatin treatments resulted in decreased cell viabilities in
      various TNBC cell lines. Compared with PTEN wild-type TNBC cells, PTEN
      mutant-type TNBC cells showed a decreased response to simvastatin. Expressions of
      phosphorylated Akt and total Akt showed an inverse relationship with PTEN
      expression. The TNBC cell lines, which showed increased expression of p-Akt,
      appeared to attenuate the expression of p-Akt by PTEN loss in simvastatin-treated
      TNBC cells. The Akt inhibitor, LY294002, augmented the effect of simvastatin on

TI  - Bcl2 is an independent prognostic marker of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
      and predicts response to anthracycline combination (ATC) chemotherapy (CT) in
      adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.
PG  - 2801-7
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdt277 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TNBC represents a heterogeneous subgroup of BC with poor prognosis
      and frequently resistant to CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The relationship between
      Bcl2 immunohistochemical protein expression and clinico-pathological outcomes was
      assessed in 736 TNBC-patients: 635 patients had early primary-TNBC (EP-TNBC) and 
      101 had primary locally advanced (PLA)-TNBC treated with neo-adjuvant- ATC-CT.
      RESULTS: Negative Bcl2 (Bcl2-) was observed in 70% of EP-TNBC and was
      significantly associated with high proliferation, high levels of P-Cadherin,
      E-Cadherin and HER3 (P's < 0.01), while Bcl2+ was significantly associated with
      high levels of p27, MDM4 and SPAG5 (P < 0.01). After controlling for chemotherapy
      and other prognostic factors, Bcl2- was associated with 2-fold increased risk of 
      death (P = 0.006) and recurrence (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, the prognosis of
      EP-TNBC/Bcl2- patients had improved both BC-specific survival (P = 0.002) and
      disease-free survival (P = 0.003), if they received adjuvant-ATC-CT. Moreover,
      Bcl2- expression was an independent predictor of pathological complete response
      of primary locally advanced triple negative breast cancer (PLA-TNBC) treated with
      neoadjuvant-ATC-CT (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Adding Bcl2 to the panel of markers
      used in current clinical practice could provide both prognostic and predictive
      information in TNBC. TNBC/Bcl2- patients appear to benefit from ATC-CT, whereas
      Bcl2+ TNBC seems to be resistant to ATC-CT and may benefit from a trial of
      different type of chemotherapy with/without novel-targeted agents.

TI  - Clinicopathological and prognostic characteristics of triple- negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) in Chinese patients: a retrospective study.
PG  - 3779-84
AB  - AIMS: To determine the clinical, pathological and prognostic features associated 
      with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS: Clinical and histologic data 
      of 21,749 breast cancer patients who were treated at Tianjin Medical University
      Cancer Institute and Hospital between July 2002 and December 2011 were collected.
      Patients were divided into two groups: those with TNBC and those with other types
      of breast cancer. Patients and tumor characteristics were compared between the
      two groups using the Chi-square test. The prognostic results of 9,823 patients in
      the study population were also analyzed to determine long-term survival rates in 
      the two groups of breast cancer patients. RESULTS: Among the breast cancer
      patients treated in our hospital between 2003 and 2011, 10.4%-13.5% of them had
      triple-negative breast cancers. Data analyses revealed significant differences in
      disease onset age, family history of breast cancer, tumor size, tumor histologic 
      grade, lymph note positivity and metastatic status between TNBC and non-TNBC
      patients. There were also significant differences in 5-year, 7-year and 9-year
      disease-free and 7-year and 9-year overall survival probability between the
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: TNBC are associated with younger disease onset age, larger
      tumor size, higher rate of axillary lymph node positivity, and higher tumor
      histologic grade. TNBC is also related to family history of breast cancer,
      increased metastatic risk and poor prognosis.

TI  - Mechanisms of tumor immune escape in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) with
      and without mutated BRCA 1.
PG  - 141-7
LID - 10.1007/s00404-013-2922-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are associated with an adverse
      outcome, although these tumors are sensitive to chemotherapy. In part, this
      phenomenon could be caused by tumor immune escape. The current study investigates
      immunogenicity of TNBC cells in vitro and the presence of immunosuppressive
      factors in the tumor microenvironment (pAKT and B7H1 expression, infiltration
      with regulatory T cells, [Tregs]). METHODS: Natural killer (NK)-cell induced
      lysis was evaluated in estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF 7 breast cancers, in
      MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 and in HCC-1937 (BRCA 1 mutated) and HCC-1806 TNBC cells.
      Expression of pAKT, B7H1 and infiltration with Tregs were determined by
      immunohistochemistry in human specimens of benign and malignant breast disease.
      RESULTS: NK-cell induced lysis was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in four
      TNBC cell lines compared to ER + MCF 7 cells. Fibroadenomas and mastectomy
      samples were not infiltrated with Tregs. Infiltration with Tregs was 0.92 +/-
      0.21 in ER/PR + breast cancers and significantly higher in TNBC without (2.30 +/-
      0.34) and also significantly higher with mutation of BRCA 1 (2.10 +/- 0.34).
      Expression of pAKT was absent in benign controls and 1.23 +/- 0.36 in ER/PR +
      breast cancers, 1.78 +/- 0.40 in TNBC without and 2.40 +/- 0.30 with mutated BRCA
      1. No significant differences of B7H1 expression occurred among the breast cancer
      subgroups. CONCLUSION: TNBC cell stimulate the NK-cell immune response
      significantly stronger than ER positive breast cancer cells. This could explain
      why infiltration with immunosuppressive Tregs is increased in human specimens of 
      TNBC with and without mutated BRCA 1. Accordingly, immunomodulatory treatment
      strategies should be further explored in TNBC.

TI  - Soluble-E-cadherin activates HER and IAP family members in HER2+ and TNBC human
      breast cancers.
PG  - 893-906
LID - 10.1002/mc.22048 [doi]
AB  - Recent literature suggests that sEcad exerts pro-oncogenic effects, possibly
      acting as a ligand for the human epidermal growth factor family. Here we show
      that sEcad is a novel candidate protein for drug targeting since it is increased 
      in human and mouse HER2-positive (HER2+) breast tumors, MMTV-PyMT bodily fluids
      and human cell culture systems. Mechanistically, we show that endogenous sEcad,
      and to a lesser extent membrane-bound E-cadherin, associates with HER1, HER2, and
      HER3 in human and MMTV-PyMT mouse HER2+ tumors and with HER1 in triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) specimens. Furthermore, addition of exogenous recombinant
      human E-cadherin/Fc chimeric protein (rhEcad/Fc; sEcad) to HER2+ MCF-7, SKBR3,
      and HER2-negative MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells, resulted in sEcad-HER receptor family
      interactions, activation of HER1-4 and downstream pro-survival signaling,
      including the MAPK-PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways and IAP family members. Lastly, we
      demonstrate that sEcad exerts pro-oncogenic effects via HER signaling, and acts
      additively with the HER ligand EGF to promote HER2+ breast cancer proliferation
      and migration, as well as TNBC invasion. Because sEcad associates and activates
      many of the oncogenic pathways that tumors utilize for growth and survival and
      serum levels in patients correlates with clinical response, suggests that
      targeted therapy against sEcad in combination with other therapies may
      potentially offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast
      cancers.

TI  - RAD51 genotype and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) risk in Polish women.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - The most lethal damage for the cell among all damage is double-strand breaks
      (DSB) of DNA. DSB cause development of cancer diseases including the
      triple-negative molecular subtype of breast cancer. The aim of this work was to
      evaluate the single nucleotide polymorphism -135G>C (rs1801320) of the RAD51 gene
      encoding DNA repair proteins by homologous recombination (HR) in triple-negative 
      breast cancer (TNBC). We assessed the RAD51 -135G>C polymorphism in 50 women with
      triple-negative breast cancer and in 50 women from the control group. RAD51
      polymorphism was analysed by the PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length
      polymorphism) technique. Our results demonstrated a significant positive
      association between the RAD51 C/C genotype and TNBC, with an adjusted odds ratio 
      (OR) of 5.95 (p = 0.002). The homozygous C/C genotype was found in 68% of breast 
      cancer cases and 20% of controls. The variant 135C allele of RAD51 increased TNBC
      risk. This is the first study linking single nucleotide polymorphisms of the
      RAD51 gene with TNBC incidence in the population of Polish women. In conclusion, 
      RAD51 polymorphisms may be regarded as predictive factors of triple-negative
      breast cancer in the female population. Large studies are needed to confirm our
      findings.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate expression of CD147 and MMP-9 in
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) so as to determine whether these two
      proteins may be correlated with poor prognosis of TNBC patients. We examined the 
      expression levels of the CD147 and MMP-9 in 127 patients with TNBC and 30
      patients with mammary gland fibroma using immunohistochemical staining before any
      treatments. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of
      these two proteins and various clinicopathologic factors including survival
      status of patients with TNBC. Positive stain of CD147 and MMP-9 was observed in
      all samples of TNBC. A statistically positive correlation was observed between
      the expression levels of CD147 and MMP-9 in TNBC tissues. The incidences of high 
      expression were 48.0 % for CD147 and 53.5 % for MMP-9 in 127 TNBC tissues,
      respectively. High expression of either CD147 or MMP-9 was significantly
      correlated with clinical feature and shorter progression-free survival (PFS)
      (P(CD147) = 0.039; P(MMP-9) = 0.017) and overall survival (OS) (P(CD147) = 0.037;
      P(MMP-9) = 0.023). The expression levels of CD147 and MMP-9 are positively
      correlated with invasion, metastasis and shorter PFS/OS of TNBC. Patients with
      high expression of CD147 and MMP-9 had poor prognosis than TNBC patients with low
      expression.

TI  - Expression of melatonin receptors in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in
      African American and Caucasian women: relation to survival.
PG  - 677-87

AB  - In the normal rodent breast, the pineal hormone melatonin controls the
      development of ductal and alveolar tissue. Melatonin counteracts tumor occurrence
      and tumor cell progression in vivo and in vitro in animal and human breast cancer
      cell cultures. It acts predominantly through its melatonin MT1 receptor. Our aim 
      was to investigate the presence or absence of the MT1 melatonin receptor in the
      aggressive triple negative group of human breast carcinoma (TNBC) and its
      possible relationship to the course of the disease. A total of 167 patients with 
      a ER-, PR-, Her-2/neu- phenotype in which tissue for receptor studies was
      available were examined. The MT1 receptor immunostain was evaluated
      semiquantitatively as staining intensity (0, 1, 2, 3), percentage of stained
      cells and the weighted index (WI) (staining intensity times percentage of stained
      cells). A score of WI < 60 was regarded as "negative". There was a striking
      difference in incidence of MT1 positivity and staining intensity between
      carcinomas in African American (AA) and Caucasian (C) women. The AA showed a
      higher incidence of MT1 negative tumors (41/84 = 48.8 % in AA, 6/51 = 11.8 % in
      C) and a lower average WI. MT1 positivity in TNBC was associated with a lower
      stage and a smaller tumor size at time of diagnosis. In multivariable survival
      analysis, MT1 negative TNBC in all cases regardless of race showed a
      significantly higher hazard ratio for disease progression, shorter progression
      free survival, and disease-related death, and shorter OS. This was especially
      pronounced in the AA group but did not reach statistical significance in the
      smaller group of C alone. These results suggest that melatonin or a melatonin
      receptor agonist may be useful biologic additions in the treatment of some forms 
      of TNBC, especially in AA who generally show a more aggressive course of their
      disease.

TI  - Neoadjuvant treatments for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PG  - vi35-9
AB  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides a means both of improving subsequent surgical
      intervention and of testing novel therapies or combinations. Historically,
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has responded well in the neoadjuvant
      setting, with rates of pathological complete response (pCR) commonly higher than 
      for other breast tumour types. However, more than half of TNBC patients do not
      achieve a pCR and have a very poor prognosis. The lack of drug-targetable
      receptors on TNBC tumours has made improving the available interventions in TNBC 
      an area of important medical need. The routine use of neoadjuvant
      anthracycline/taxane combinations in TNBC is currently being supplemented by
      ongoing investigations of their use with other types of agent. In particular, the
      substantial proportion of TNBC tumours associated with BRCA1 mutations is driving
      clinical research into the use of DNA-damaging agents such as platinums, as well 
      as of potentiators of DNA damage such as the investigational agent iniparib and
      inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerase such as olaparib. Tyrosine kinase
      receptor inhibitors and microtubule-targeting inhibitors of cell cycling are also
      under active investigation. The use of neoadjuvant treatment with pCR as a
      surrogate of overall survival will allow the rapid evaluation and comparison of
      these and other much-needed new treatments for TNBC.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that 
      is clinically negative for the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors 
      (ER/PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). Patients with TNBC
      have a worse clinical outcome, as measured by time to metastasis and median
      overall survival. Chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment of TNBC but
      responses are disappointing. A substantial proportion of TNBC expresses
      luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), receptors for LHRH, in addition to 
      receptors for growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). These receptors represent 
      potential therapeutic targets. Potent antagonists of GHRH and LHRH receptors have
      been developed in recent years and these antagonists inhibit the growth,
      tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of various human experimental
      malignancies. These antagonists could be utilized for the treatment of TNBC. The 
      targeted cytotoxic analog of LHRH, AN-152 (AEZS-108) containing doxorubicin, must
      also be strongly considered for therapy of TNBC. Experimental studies suggest the
      merit of clinical trials with LHRH antagonists and AEZS-108 in TNBC patients.

TI  - A mouse model for triple-negative breast cancer tumor-initiating cells
      (TNBC-TICs) exhibits similar aggressive phenotype to the human disease.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibit characteristics quite
      distinct from other kinds of breast cancer, presenting as an aggressive
      disease--recurring and metastasizing more often than other kinds of breast
      cancer, without tumor-specific treatment options and accounts for 15% of all
      types of breast cancer with higher percentages in premenopausal African-American 
      and Hispanic women. The reason for this aggressive phenotype is currently the
      focus of intensive research. However, progress is hampered by the lack of
      suitable TNBC cell model systems. METHODS: To understand the mechanistic basis
      for the aggressiveness of TNBC, we produced a stable TNBC cell line by sorting
      for 4T1 cells that do not express the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
      receptor (PgR) or the gene for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
      As a control, we produced a stable triple-positive breast cancer (TPBC) cell line
      by transfecting 4T1 cells with rat HER2, ER and PgR genes and sorted for cells
      with high expression of ER and PgR by flow cytometry and high expression of the
      HER2 gene by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We isolated tumor-initiating cells
      (TICs) by sorting for CD24+/CD44high/ALDH1+ cells from TNBC (TNBC-TICs) and TPBC 
      (TPBC-TICs) stable cell lines. Limiting dilution transplantation experiments
      revealed that CD24+/CD44high/ALDH1+ cells derived from TNBC (TNBC-TICs) and TPBC 
      (TPBC-TICs) were significantly more effective at repopulating the mammary glands 
      of naive female BALB/c mice than CD24-/CD44-/ALDH1- cells. Implantation of the
      TNBC-TICs resulted in significantly larger tumors, which metastasized to the
      lungs to a significantly greater extent than TNBC, TPBC-TICs, TPBC or parental
      4T1 cells. We further demonstrated that the increased aggressiveness of TNBC-TICs
      correlates with the presence of high levels of mouse twenty-five kDa heat shock
      protein (Hsp25/mouse HspB1) and seventy-two kDa heat shock protein
      (Hsp72/HspA1A). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we have developed a TNBC-TICs model 
      system based on the 4T1 cells which is a very useful metastasis model with the
      advantage of being able to be transplanted into immune competent recipients. Our 
      data demonstrates that the TNBC-TICs model system could be a useful tool for
      studies on the pathogenesis and therapeutic treatment for TNBC.

      investigate clinical characteristics and outcomes of metastatic TNBCs. In
      addition, we were to find out the marker which could divide TNBCs into a few
      subgroups according to different clinical features. METHODS: We retrospectively
      analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of patients with
      metastatic TNBC who received palliative treatment between 1999 and 2007. RESULTS:
      The median relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of 152 patients 
      were 24 and 20 months, respectively. Divided TNBCs based on a RFS of 36 months,
      the patients with a RFS of >/=36 months had a better disease control rate (DCR), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and OS than those with a RFS of <3 years.
      Cox-regression multivariate analysis for RFS and OS revealed EGFR positivity and 
      a low BRCA1 score as an independent risk factor for OS. CONCLUSIONS: The patients
      with a RFS >/= 3 years had a significantly better DCR, PFS, and OS than patients 
      who had a RFS < 3 years. BRCA1 and EGFR expression may be candidate determinants 
      to distinguish RFS. A prospective clinical trial for different therapeutic
      strategies is needed for each subgroup.

AB  - Breast cancer is not considered anymore a unique disease. Microarray gene
      expression analysis led to the identification of 4 major breast cancer
      "intrinsic" subtypes, including hormone receptor (HR)-positive luminal A and B,
      human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and basal-like breast cancer
      (BLBC). These subtypes have distinct phenotypes, molecular profiles, clinical
      behaviour and response to therapy, with the BLBC carrying the worst outcome.
      Microarray analysis is not feasible in routine practice and therefore oncologists
      rely on a simpler immunohistochemical (IHC) classification to identify relevant
      breast cancer subtypes. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the
      absence of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 expression at IHC
      analysis. TNBC is strictly related to BLBC and, given the lack of common
      therapeutic targets, represent a major challenge for breast oncologist. In this
      review we will summarize the updated knowledge on TNBC, with emphasis on its
      current treatment and on the new therapeutic options under development.
